Over years studying contextual system of measurements has been contributory for exploring parallelism between quantum mechanics and cognitive psychology. Present manuscript characterizes theory
underlying contextual cyclic-4 system of dichotomous measurements in terms of indeterminism and
inconsistent connectedness of the theory. Precisely speaking, it deals with quantification of these two
features for any indeterministic and/or inconsistently connected theoretical explanation of contextual
cyclic-4 system of measurements. In this context, upper bound of violation of a noncontextual
inequality (arising in Contextuality by Default framework (Dzhafarov et al., 2016 [1,2])) has been
provided in terms of suitable measures of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness. Bound is
then exploited to establish relations between amount of violation and measures of these two features
interpreting true contextuality and also that attributable to direct influences. Theoretical models of
a few pre-existing contextual systems are provided as some specific instances related to the general
framework of mathematically analyzing human decision making. In course of analysis, characterization
(in terms of underlying theory) of consistently connected system of measurements is obtained.

1. Introduction
In course of evolution of the study of quantum mechanics,
new theory of stochastic and dynamic systems originated in
parallel (Pitowsky, 0000). Such a generalized probabilistic theory
started exploring application of probabilistic dynamic system,
encompassing quantum theory in the domain of day to day human life, more precisely in interpreting cognition and theory of
decision making.
Before the advent of this new approach of studying probabilistic theory, almost every paradigm in cognitive and allied sciences
was based on principles stemming from classical probabilistic
dynamic systems. Some studies of modeling based on classical
theory, however generated some observations which were inexplicable within the scope of the theory and remained enlisted
as paradoxes for a long time (Busemeyer, Wang, & LambertMogiliansky, 2009; Pelletier, 1994; Townsend, Silva, SpencerSmith, & Wenger, 2000; Tversky & Kahneman, 1983; Tversky
& Shafir, 1992). With gradual advancement of quantum theory,
analogy was observed between its different nonclassical aspects
and that of cognitive science. Quantum models of cognition and

decision started developing along the line of researches in field
of neuroscience, computer science and psychology.
Narrowing down to the field of human psychology, study
of inter-relation between quantum theory and that of cognitive
psychology has underwent gradual development based on repeated application of quantum formalism in interpreting existing
concepts of human thought procedures (for a review, see Busemeyer & Bruza, 0000). Among various directions of exploring
inter-relation between quantum theory and cognitive science, establishing contextual nature of behavioral data set, is noteworthy.
Broadly speaking, contextuality refers to the impossibility of
expressing measurements of same property in different situations
(contexts) by same random variable. Contextuality is one of the
most important nonclassical feature of quantum theory (Fine,
1982; Kochen & Specker, 1967; Kurzynski, Ramanathan, & Kaszlikowski, 2012; Liang, Spekkens, & Wiseman, 2011). Over years,
this property has been studied extensively in human psychology (Abramsky & Brandenburger, 2011; Adenier & Khrennikov,
2007; Asano, Hashimoto, Khrennikov, Ohya, & Tanaka, 2014;
Basieva, Cervantes, Dzhafarov, & Khrennikov, 0000; Bruza, Kitto,

2016; Dzhafarov, Kujala and Larsson, 2015; Dzhafarov, Zhang and

Kujala, Dzhafarov, & Larsson, 2015). Framework of Contextualityby-Default (CbD) (Cervantes & Dzhafarov, 2018; Dzhafarov et al.,
2017; Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2014a, 2016, 2017; Dzhafarov, Kujala et al., 2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016; Kujala & Dzhafarov,
2016; Kujala et al., 2015) evolved based on generalizing notion of contextuality in quantum theory. Context dependence
of measurements forms the basic ingredient for the study of
contextuality. Difference in distributions of random variables
corresponding to measurements of same property in different
contexts is also a form of context dependence. But this form
of context relevance of random variables generated by direct
causal influence imposed by change in contexts is not the only
notion of contextuality. This form of contextuality is often referred to as contextuality due to direct influences. Contextuality is
also observed when due to difference in contexts, measurements
of same property are represented by more dissimilar random
variables than ensured by the difference in their distributions.
In fact latter form of contextuality is referred to as true contextuality. In quantum theory, any system of measurements being
consistently connected (nosignaling principle), observed contextuality is always true form of contextuality (Fine, 1982; Kochen &
Specker, 1967; Liang et al., 2011). This in contrast to that in cognitive science as measurements involved there are inconsistently
connected.
In earlier times, contextual systems of measurements in
human behavior were detected by a necessary and sufficient
criterion (Kujala et al., 2015). That criterion can detect true contextuality in consistently connected systems only. Measurements
involved in psychophysical experiments being inconsistently connected, such contextuality was however not true form of contextuality and was attributable to direct influence (due to change
in contexts) only. With advent of time, Contextuality-by-Default
theory helped in demarcating true form of contextuality from
that resulting due to inconsistent connectedness in the overall
context dependent framework. A new form of noncontextual
inequality was derived (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016), violation of
which guaranteed presence of true contextuality. This criterion
rendered all earlier evidences of contextual systems involving
human judgement to be not truly contextual. The first evidence
of truly contextual measurements was provided in Cervantes and
Dzhafarov (2018).
Any system of correlations generated in an experiment can
always be interpreted in terms of a theoretical model compatible
with the experimental data set (Bell, 1987; Fine, 1982; Wiseman,
2006). Such an interpretation of correlations is often referred to
as hidden variable description of the same. Speaking of hidden
variable theory, there exist different features characterizing its
nature (Bell, 1987; Wiseman, 2006). For instance, indeterminism,
signaling were considered as some nonclassical traits of any
hidden variable theory (Hall, 2010) underlying nonlocal quantum
correlations showing Bell–CHSH violation (Bell, 1964; Clauser,
Horne, Shimony, & Holt, 1969). In perspective of analyzing psychophysical experiments, one may characterize hidden variable
interpretation of contextual system of measurements. Precisely
speaking, it will be interesting to characterize theory underlying
contextual data set (in CbD framework (Dzhafarov, Kujala et al.,
2016)) in terms of parameters corresponding to one or more
features of the theory. Our present discussion evolves in this
direction.
Here we have considered the notions of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness for any hidden variable model compatible with contextual data set for any cyclic-4 system of dichotomic
measurements (Dzhafarov, Kujala et al., 2016; Dzhafarov et al.,
2016). Now like any set of correlations, contextual data set is
always explicable by deterministic hidden variable model. However such a model turns out to be inconsistently connected. This

in turn points out trade-off existing between these two features
of any theoretical interpretation of contextuality. Using suitable
measures of these two notions we quantify degrees of indeterminism and/or inconsistent connectedness required to interpret
any contextual data set. We have considered both truly contextual form and also that resulting due to direct influences. Now,
violation of a noncontextual inequality being the detector of contextuality, any relation between it and parameters of underlying
theory will be helpful for the aforesaid purpose of quantification.
We have derived upper bound of violation of a noncontextual
inequality framed in CbD approach (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016).
That upper bound of violation is then further exploited to obtain
relations between amount of violation (observed in a system of
measurements) and degrees of indeterminism and inconsistent
connectedness allowed by any hidden variable model (compatible
with the given system). For any finite amount of violation (V ,say)
observed, these relations turned out to be useful to quantify
how much amount of indeterminism and/or inconsistent connectedness should be allowed by any hidden variable theory to
explain truly contextual data set showing V amount of violation.
We did similar analysis for data set whose contextuality is contributed only from direct influences. In course of our analysis, we
obtain characterization of consistently connected system of measurements in perspective of theoretical interpretation. Having
established relations between violation amount and parameters
of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness (at ontic level),
we use the same to frame hidden variable models compatible
with some pre-existing contextual data sets.
Rest of our work is divided into following sections: in Section 2, we provide mathematical tools and techniques to be used
later. In Section 3 we introduce the measures of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness at ontic level. In Section 4
we characterize indeterministic and/or inconsistently connected
theory interpreting different forms of contextuality in terms of
these measures. For our purpose we have considered the CbD
framework. In Section 5, some explicit hidden variable models are
generated. We end our discussion with some concluding remarks
in Section 6.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Random variables for measurement outcomes
Consider any system of measurements where properties q1 , q2 ,
. . . , qn are measured and let c1 , c2 , . . . , cm denote the different
contexts of measurements. Let the outcome obtained in measuring any property qi in context cj be denoted in terms of a random
cj

j

j

j′

variable Rqi or simply Ri . Any two variables Ri and Ri′ having
the same distribution will be denoted by
j

j′

Ri ∼ Ri′ .

(1)

2.2. Connections and bunches
In physics, property q refers to measuring any physical quantity. Apart from the world of physics, such as in the cognitive
domain, measuring q may refer to as a query posed to any
human subject. Now measuring q in a context c refers to some
collection of other properties which are measured together with
q. So random variables denoting outcomes of measuring different
properties in same context are jointly distributed. For any fixed c,
collection of Rcq with different q′ s forms a bunch of measurements
corresponding to context c. Different Rcq forming a bunch thus
have a joint distribution.
Now let q can be measured in two separate contexts c and c ′ .
′
Corresponding random variables Rcq , and Rcq form a connection
of q. q being measured in different collections of properties cor′
responding to c and c ′ , variables Rcq and Rcq do not have joint
distribution.

all possible couplings of {Rcq , Rcq }. Based on the idea of maximal
couplings, notion of noncontextuality was first introduced for
consistently connected system.

2.3. Consistent connectedness
Consistent Connectedness (Dzhafarov et al., 2016) forms one of
the basic ingredients for the broader perspective of characterizing systems of measurements (Basieva et al., 0000; Cervantes &
Dzhafarov, 0000, 2018; Dzhafarov, Kujala et al., 2015; Dzhafarov
et al., 2016). It deals with distributions of the random variables
corresponding to outcomes of measurements of every property in
different contexts.

Definition (Noncontextual Consistently Connected System (CbD Approach)). A consistently connected system of measurements is
noncontextual if and only there exists a coupling of the entire system from which maximal couplings for all possible connections
can be obtained as subcouplings.

Definition (Consistent Connection). Let q denote property of a
system and c , c ′ denote two contexts in which q can be measured.
′
Then Rcq , Rcq forming a connection for any property q, is said to

A necessary and sufficient condition in form of a noncontextual
inequality was framed (Kujala et al., 2015) for cyclic-m systems
of dichotomic measurements:

q, its connection is consistent.

where

where both possibilities + and − are to be considered and the
maximum is to be taken over all possibilities containing an odd
number of − signs. Any consistently connected system of measurements is contextual if and only if it violates Eq. (2). However,
for an inconsistently connected system, contextuality guaranteed
by violation of Eq. (2) may be due to direct influences exerted
by change in contexts. As already discussed before, this form of
contextuality may be referred to as contextuality due to direct influences and is not true form of contextuality (Dzhafarov & Kujala,
2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016). In CbD framework (Dzhafarov &
Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016), the authors analyzed true
form of contextuality by generalizing above notion of noncontextuality (using couplings) beyond consistently connected system
of measurements.

So, in a consistently connected system, all the possible connections of measurements are consistent. Existence of at least one
inconsistent connection thus guarantees corresponding system to
be inconsistently connected.
2.4. Cyclic system of measurements (Basieva et al., 0000; Dzhafarov
& Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016)
Definition. Consider a system involving measurement of finite
number m (say) of properties q1 , q2 , . . . , qm . Let c1 , c2 , . . . , cm be
the contexts associated with the system. The system of measurements is said to be a cyclic system of rank m or simply cyclic-m
c
c
system if all the possible connections are given by: {Rq11 , Rqm1 },
cm−1
cm−1
cm−2
c3
c2
c2
c1
cm
{Rq2 , Rq2 }, {Rq3 , Rq3 }, . . . ., {Rqm−1 , Rqm−1 } and {Rqm , Rqm }.
For our purpose we will consider cyclic-4 system of dichotomic
measurements as the random variables Rcq will be binary valued Rcq = ±1. This particular system is well known for its
implementation quantum theory, specially in bipartite version
of EPR paradigm (Bell, 1964) and framework analyzing notion
of bipartite Bell nonlocality of quantum correlations (Bell, 1964;
Clauser et al., 1969).

Definition (Noncontextual System (CbD Approach)). Any system of
measurements is noncontextual if and only if there exists a coupling of the entire system from which maximal couplings for all
possible connections can be obtained as subcouplings (Dzhafarov
& Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016).

2.5. Contextuality

Sodd (⟨Rcq11 , Rcq12 ⟩, ⟨Rcq22 , Rcq23 ⟩, . . . , ⟨Rcqm1 , Rcqmm ⟩) − ∆ > −2 + m

Traditional understanding of noncontextuality is based on the
assumption of context irrelevance. Under such assumption, random variables corresponding to measurements of same property
in different contexts are treated as the same random variable.
Using a single random variable for measurements (of a property)
in different contexts however leads to various inconsistencies. In
contextuality by default (CbD) approach different random vari′
ables, say Rcq and Rcq , correspond to measurement of q in two
different contexts c , c ′ (Basieva et al., 0000; Cervantes & Dzhafarov, 0000, 2018; Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov, Kujala
et al., 2016; Dzhafarov, Zhang et al., 2015; Dzhafarov et al., 2016).
In CbD theory, analogue of context irrelevance hypothesis is
framed using the notion of couplings. For our purpose we consider
contextuality in CbD framework.
Consider any system of measurements. For any property q,
′
it is impossible to compare Rcq , Rcq forming connection of q.
Another set of jointly distributed random variables {Tqc } (say) is
considered such that Rcq ∼ Tqc ∀q, c. This collection is defined
as coupling for the entire system of measurements. Now, for any
individual property q of the system, a pair of jointly distributed
′
random variables {Tqc , Tqc } is defined as a coupling of connection

where

′

A noncontextual inequality was framed in this respect for cyclic
systems of measurements (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016):
(4)

c

∆ = |⟨Rcq11 ⟩ − ⟨Rcqm1 ⟩| + |⟨Rcq12 ⟩ − ⟨Rcq22 ⟩| + · · · + |⟨Rqmm−1 ⟩ − ⟨Rcqmm ⟩|
(5)
A system is truly contextual if and only if it violates Eq. (4).
Clearly, comparison of above two noncontextual inequalities implies that contextuality due to direct influences is the only form of
context dependence possible in case an inconsistently connected
cyclic system violates Eq. (2) but abides by Eq. (4).
In early psychophysical experiments contextuality was attributable to direct influences only and therefore not truly contextual (Basieva et al., 0000; Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov
et al., 2016). N2 is one such example Aerts et al. (2018a).
In Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018) first examples of true contextual data in psychology experiment were reported. For our
purpose we consider one of those data sets (N1 ) generated in the
‘‘Snow Queen’’ experiment (Cervantes & Dzhafarov, 2018).

to choosing from ‘Another Wind Direction’. To generate joint
probability distributions, joint measurements were performed
on a conceptual entity obtained by combining concepts of two
different wind directions. To be precise, in a joint measurement
a participant chooses one out of four possible outcomes which
are combinations of possible outcomes of two measurements (see
Table 3) corresponding to two conceptual entities: ‘One Wind
Direction’ and ‘Another Wind Direction’ (Aerts et al., 2018a).
Let N2 denote the set of joint probability distributions obtained in the experiment (see Table 4).

Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018). In the experiment each participant was provided with the storyline and was then asked to make
two suitable choices (choosing a character and a characteristic)
forming a context such that the context of the choices made
matches with the storyline (for more details see Basieva et al.,
0000; Cervantes & Dzhafarov, 2018). Here offering a choice to a
participant corresponds to that of measuring a property (q). Each
of q1 , q3 denote making choice from a pair of characters and each
of q2 , q4 correspond to choosing between pair of characteristics
(for details, see Table 1).
Let N1 denote the corresponding set of correlations. Correlations collected at the end of the experiment (see Table 2) are then
used to test the noncontextual inequality (Kujala & Dzhafarov,
2016; Kujala et al., 2015) given by Eq. (16). Corresponding system
of measurements is truly contextual as the data set violates
Eq. (16)

2.8. Consistently connected numerical data set
Consistently connected data set is provided in Aerts et al.
(2018b). In this context it may be pointed out that N3 is derived
from N2 via some computational modification based on isometry
argument (Dzhafarov et al., 2016). As pointed out in Dzhafarov
et al. (2016), consistent connectedness of N3 can be attributed to
this modification only, which however, can render any data set
to satisfy marginal selectivity trivially. So N3 is not a true experimental data set. For our purpose to analyze hidden variable description of a consistently connected system, we consider it only
as a numerical data set (see Table 5) related to a psychophysical
thought experiment.

2.7. Experimental data showing contextuality due to direct influences
Experiment reported in Aerts et al. (2018a), involved an inconsistently connected system of measurements which is not
truly contextual There measurement corresponded to asking a
human subject to make two selections of wind directions: one
from a set of two directions labeled as ‘One Wind Direction’ and
another from a different set of two directions labeled as ‘Another
Wind Direction’ (Table 3). Let each of q1 , q3 correspond to making selection from ‘One Wind Direction’ and q2 , q4 correspond

2.9. Hidden variable theory
Theoretically, correlations generated in an experiment can
always be interpreted as averages over some suitable distribution of a random variable such that for any fixed value of the
underlying variable, every measurement outcome is completely

A hidden variable model is said to be consistently connected if,
for every property q, distributions of connections conditioned on
λ are the same:

0.09

′

Pr [Rcq = b|λ] ∼ Pr [Rcq = b|λ], ∀ q, c , c ′ , b and λ.

Consequently if there exists at least one instance of difference
in conditional distribution of connection (conditioned on λ) then
corresponding hidden variable model is said to allow inconsistent
connectedness and is referred to as inconsistently connected model.
Here we introduce two measures corresponding to maximum and
minimum degrees of inconsistent connectedness.

determined. Such a variable is often referred to as hidden variable and corresponding mathematical description of operational
data is referred to as the hidden variable model underlying the
observed correlations (Bell, 1987; Wiseman, 2006). For instance,
let (ρ (λ), Λ) denote a hidden variable model of a system of
measurements where ρ (λ) denote normalized density function
of λ over the continuous spectrum Λ. Then corresponding to
measurement of any property q in context c, the probability that
Rcq assumes value a is given by:
Pr [Rcq

∫
= a] =
Λ

ρ (λ)Pr [Rcq

= a|λ]dλ.

Definition.(i): Denoted by Smin , minimum degree of inconsistent
connectedness at ontic level may be defined as:

Smin = Infq,c ,c ′ ,λ,b |Pr [Rcq = b|λ] − Pr [Rcq = b|λ]|.

Λ

ontic level, denoted by Smax may be defined as:

ρ (λ)dλ = 1.

Smax = Supq,c ,c ′ ,λ,b |Pr [Rcq = b|λ] − Pr [Rcq = b|λ]|.

Note that in a system, any property q can be measured in
more than two contexts. Let q be measured in c1 , c2 , . . . , ck (k ≥
2). Then if there exists difference across any one possible subconnection of q corresponding to two contexts (ci , cj (i ̸ = j ≤ k)),
the system is inconsistently connected. So, speaking of theory
underlying any such system, this notion of inconsistent connectedness should be considered. Hence, in defining Smax , Smin
(Eqs. (13), (12)), extremum is taken over contexts. However while
constructing hidden variable model for a cyclic system, simpler
forms of the measures can be considered:

In case λ denotes a discrete random variable, ρ (λ) stands for the
frequency distribution of λ with Λ denoting its discrete spectrum
and integration is replaced by summation.
Pr [Rcq = a] =

Given a set of experimental results, analysis of underlying theory,
i.e., discussion in terms of hidden variables, is often referred to as
characterization at ontic level (Wiseman, 2006).

Smax = Supq,λ,b |Pr [

(14)
(15)

Clearly 0 ≤ Smin ≤ Smax ≤ 1. For Smax = 0, the model
is consistently connected whereas it allows 100% inconsistent
connectedness if Smax = 1.

3. Features of hidden variable theory and their measures

3.3. Relation between Smin , Smax and I

As already mentioned before, we intend to establish relationship between parameters at operational level with some features
of underlying theory (parameters at ontic level). For our purpose,
we have considered notions of indeterminism and inconsistent
connectedness at ontic level.

From the definition of measure of indeterminism, it is clear
that ∀ c , q, λ ∈ Λ and b ∈ {±1}, the conditional probability terms
Pr [Rcq = b|λ] lie in any one of the two subintervals [0, I ] and
[1 − I , 1] of [0, 1]. If for some λ ∈ Λ and b ∈ {±1} there exists at
′
′
least one connection, Rcq , Rqc , such that Pr [Rcq = b|λ], Pr [Rcq =
b|λ] do not lie in the same subinterval then Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .
So if Smax < 1 − 2I , then for every possible value of hidden
variable, conditional probability terms corresponding to every
possible connection must lie in same subinterval:

3.1. Degree of indeterminism
Determinism refers to the property that all the probabilities
are certain given the complete knowledge of λ. To be precise,
given complete specification of λ, probability that any random
variable Rcq assumes a value b is always certain: Pr [Rcq = b|λ] ∈

′

Pr [Rcq = b|λ], Pr [Rcq = b|λ] ∈ [0, I ]or [1 − I , 1], ∀λ, q.

Now further for Smax ≥ 1 − 2I , if Smin ≥ 1 − 2I , then ∀ c , q,
λ ∈ Λ and b ∈ {±1}, conditional probability terms corresponding
to every possible connection must lie in different subintervals.

4.2. Upper bound of violation of noncontextual inequality (Eq. (16))
Violation of Eq. (16) provides a necessary and sufficient condition for M to be truly contextual (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016;
Dzhafarov et al., 2016). So the amount of violation is a suitable candidate for parameterizing truly contextual system. For
a given amount of violation of Eq. (16), we quantify amount of
indeterminism and/or inconsistent connectedness (in terms of
measures) characterizing any compatible hidden variable model.
This in turn helps in analyzing all feasible theoretical explanations
of the concerned system of measurements. To be precise, we
now proceed in the following manner. First we establish the
relationship between amount of violation of Eq. (16), maximum
and minimum degrees of inconsistent connectedness (Smax , Smin )
and that of indeterminism(I ). Then considering all possible measurement systems (in perspective of contextuality), we analyze all
possible hidden variable explanations (in terms of the parameters
Smax , Smin and I ) of any such system. Existence of inter relation
between the distinct features of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness (at ontic level), in context of interpreting
contextuality, becomes evident therein.
As a first step of our analysis, we derive the upper bound of
violation of Eq. (16) as a function of Smax , Smin and I .

4. Characterization of theory underlying cyclic-4 system of
dichotomic measurements
Let M denote a cyclic-4 system of dichotomic measurements.
Let (σ (λ), Γ ) be any hidden variable model underlying correlations generated by M. As already discussed before, the model can
be deterministic. But in such case, the model may turn out to
be inconsistently connected. Again if the model is indeterministic, then it may or may not be inconsistently connected. The
interplay between these two features of the underlying theory
depends on the system M. In this section we discuss all the
possible forms of (σ (λ), Γ ) in perspective of contextuality of
M thereby quantifying the degrees of indeterminism and/or inconsistent connectedness (characterizing the model) to interpret
corresponding correlations. For entire analysis, we consider CbD
framework of contextuality (for details, see Dzhafarov, Kujala
et al., 2016). Noncontextual inequality (Eqs. (4), (5)) for M given
by:
CHSH − ∆4 ≤ 2,

(16)

Theorem 1. Consider a cyclic-4 system of measurements having
binary valued outcomes {±1} and t(0 < t ≤ 4) number of inconsistent connections. Then for any hidden variable model of the system,
the upper bound of violation of noncontextual inequality (Eq. (16)) is
given in terms of measures of indeterminism(I ), minimum(Smin ) and
maximum(Smax ) inconsistent connectedness allowed by the model:

where

∆4 = |⟨R11 ⟩ − ⟨R41 ⟩| + |⟨R12 ⟩ − ⟨R22 ⟩| + |⟨R23 ⟩ − ⟨R33 ⟩|

+ |⟨R34 ⟩ − ⟨R44 ⟩|

(17)

and
(4)

CHSH = Sodd (⟨R11 R12 ⟩, ⟨R23 R22 ⟩, ⟨R33 R34 ⟩, ⟨R41 R44 ⟩).

CHSH − ∆4 < B(I , Smax , Smin )

(18)

where upper bound of violation B(I , Smax , Smin ) is given by:

Before we analyze violation of the noncontextual inequality
(Eq. (16)), let us first analyze the term ∆4 (Eq. (17)) which is
referred to as a measure of inconsistent connectedness related
to M (Dzhafarov & Kujala, 2016; Dzhafarov et al., 2016).

B(I , Smax , Smin ) = 2 + 4I − 2tSmin when Smax < 1 − 2I

= 4 − 2t Smin when Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .

(21)

The above inequality (Eq. (20)) is tight if and only if Smax < 1 − 2I .

4.1. Characterizing consistently and inconsistently connected systems

Proof. See Appendix.

∆4 , (Eq. (17)) considers the inconsistency (if any) across all
four possible connections of measurements. Clearly, if all the four
connections are consistently connected, then each of the absolute
values vanishes in Eq. (17). ∆4 = 0 thus implies corresponding
system of measurements to be consistently connected. Let t denote the number of inconsistent connections in the system M,
i.e., the number of non zero absolute quantities appearing in the
expression of ∆4 (Eq. (17)). Now it can be proved (see Appendix)
that:
∆4 ≤ 2tSmax .

(20)

4.3. Implications of Theorem 1
Let us now analyze B(I , Smax , Smin ) so as to derive relation between amount of violation V1 observed for any cyclic-4 system of
dichotomic measurements M and parameters of any underlying
theoretical model.
4.3.1. Truly contextual inconsistently connected system of measurements
Such a system violates Eq. (16). Let the correlations generated
in such a system violate Eq. (16) by an amount V1 > 0. Then,

(19)

Clearly, if Smax = 0 then ∆4 vanishes. This implies that existence
of a consistently connected hidden variable model compatible
with any system of measurements, guarantees consistent connectedness of the system. Hence, an inconsistently connected
system cannot be interpreted in terms of a consistently connected
hidden variable theory. However, the converse is not true. A
consistently connected system can be explained by inconsistently
connected hidden variable theory (see Table 12).
Having completed characterization of both consistently and
inconsistently connected systems, we now try to analyze contextual system of measurements. For that we derive upper bound of
violation of noncontextual inequality in terms of parameters of
underlying hidden variable theory.

V1 < B(I , Smax , Smin )

(22)

Let us analyze different possible forms of theoretical models
underlying corresponding correlations.
a. Indeterministic inconsistently connected model: Here I ,
Smax ̸ = 0. Form of B(I , Smax , Smin ) given by Eq. (21) gives two
possible cases:
Case.1 When Smax < 1 − 2I :
V1 ≤ 4I − 2tSmin
V1 + 2tSmin
or I ≥
4

(23)

K. Mukherjee and U. Mukherjee

Journal of Mathematical Psychology 104 (2021) 102598

Combining the relation between Smax , Smin and I in this case
along with lower bound of I from above relation (Eq. (23)), we
get:
0 ≤ Smin < Min[1 − 2I ,

2 − V1
2(1 + t)

model underlying the truly contextual inconsistently connected
system is characterized by Smax = 1 and Smin = 0.
c. Consistently connected model: For such a model Smax = 0. But
then the model cannot explain the system as the system is inconsistently connected and such a system cannot have a consistently
connected theoretical model. So a truly contextual inconsistently
connected system of measurements cannot be explained by a
consistently connected theoretical model irrespective of whether
the model is deterministic or indeterministic.

with Smax < 1 − 2I .

(24)

Case.2: When Smax ≥ 1 − 2I :
V1 ≤ 2(1 − tSmin )

(25)

4.3.2. Consistently connected contextual measurement system
For a consistently connected system, the noncontextual inequality (Eq. (16)) becomes:

Depending on the degree of indeterminism and minimum degree
of inconsistent connectedness allowed by the underlying theory,
following four possibilities arise:

CHSH ≤ 2

Subcase.1:
I≥

V1 + 2tSmin
4

and Smin < 1 − 2I

which is same as the Bell–CHSH inequality (Clauser et al., 1969).
Here t = 0. Following similar line of argument as that considered
for proving Theorem 1, it can be proved that CHSH ≤ B′ (I , Smax )
where B′ (I , Smax ) is given by:

(26)

which in turn gives:
1 − Smin

= 4 when Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .

V1 + 2tSmin

a. Indeterministic inconsistently connected model: Here I ,
Smax ̸ = 0. Arguing as before, it can be shown that the degrees of
indeterminism(I ) and maximum degree of inconsistent connectedness (Smax ) of such a model compatible with a truly contextual
consistently connected system of measurements must satisfy one
of the following relations:

and Smin ≥ 1 − 2I

which in turn gives:

so Smax < 1 − 2I holds. Eq. (33) in turn implies 41 ≤ I ≤ 12 .

Arguing similarly, we get:

so Smax , Smin ∈ {0, 1}. But if Smax = 0 then it is clear from
Eq. (33) that V1 ≤ 0 which is impossible. So Smax = 1. A deterministic inconsistently connected model explaining correlations
generated in a truly contextual system of measurements is thus
characterized by Smax = 1 whereas Smin ∈ {0, 1}.

Then, using above relation along with Smin < 1 − 2I and Eq. (25),

Let V1 denote the amount of violation of Eq. (31) obtained by the
system.

Subcase.2:

d. Consistently connected deterministic model: Clearly for I =
0 along with Smax = 0, Eq. (33) gives V1 ≤ 0 which is impossible
as the system is truly contextual. Consequently a truly contextual
consistently connected system of measurements can never be explained by a deterministic consistently connected hidden variable
model.
Now, any bipartite physical system showing Bell–CHSH violation (Bell, 1964, 1987; Wiseman, 2006) falls in this category
as no signaling principle (mathematically same as that of consistent connectedness criterion of measurements) is maintained
by any physical system of measurements performed by spatially
separated observers. For any bipartite physical system showing Bell–CHSH violation, Hall characterized underlying hidden
variable description in terms of degrees of indeterminism and
signaling (Hall, 2010). For any hidden variable theory, the notion
of signaling being same as that of inconsistent connectedness
mathematically, the analysis made in Hall (2010) coincides with
that made here for a truly contextual consistently connected
system.

(30)

So, Smax , Smin and I characterizing indeterministic and inconsistently connected hidden variable description of a truly contextual and inconsistently connected(t ̸ = 0) cyclic-4 system
of binary valued measurements (violating Eq. (16) by V1 ,) must
satisfy any one of the above five relations given by Eqs. (24), (27),
(28), (29), (30).
b. Deterministic inconsistently connected model: Here I = 0.
By Eqs. (10), (13), (12) Smax , Smin ∈ {0, 1}. Now Case(1) considered
above is impossible as in such case Eq. (25) implies V1 ≤ 0 which
is impossible. Hence Smax = 1. Now subcase(1) of Case(2) considered above is not valid here as in that case Smin = 0 which along
with Eq. (26) implies V1 ≤ 0. Analogous type of arguments reveal
impossibility of Subcase(2) and Subcase(4) whereas Subcase(3)
turns out to be feasible. This in turn implies that a deterministic

4.3.3. Contextuality due to direct influences
If M does not violate Eq. (16), then it is not truly contextual.
Now if it is inconsistently connected then there exists contextuality (due to direct influence) in the system. As already discussed
before, such form of contextuality can be guaranteed if and only
if M shows violation of the following noncontextual inequality:
CHSH ≤ 2
This being same as that given by Eq. (31), in this case, analysis
of upper bound of violation is same as given above for consistently connected truly contextual system. Consequently, if V1
denotes the amount of violation of Eq. (31), then I and Smax for
any indeterministic and inconsistently connected hidden variable
description of M should satisfy one of the relations given by
Eq. (33). This in turn implies the impossibility of explaining such
correlations by a consistently connected deterministic model.
However, as the system here is itself inconsistently connected so
it cannot be explained by consistently connected indeterministic
model also. So in case system exhibits contextuality due to direct
influences only, it can either be explained by an indeterministic and inconsistently connected model or by deterministic and
inconsistently connected model (see Table 6)

5. Hidden variable models: Some examples
In this section we provide with explicit models underlying
three pre-existing data sets: N1 (Table 2), N2 (Table 4) and N3
(Table 5). As already mentioned before, N1 (Cervantes & Dzhafarov, 2018), N2 (Aerts et al., 2018a) represent experimental data
whereas N3 is just a numerical data set (Aerts et al., 2018b).

4.3.4. Noncontextual system
Lastly let us now consider that M is noncontextual. So neither
it is truly contextual nor there is any contextuality attributable
to direct influences. Such a system being consistently connected,
∆4 = 0. As a consequence, along with the fact that the system
shows no violation(V1 = 0) of Eq. (16), B(I , Smax , Smin ) = 0 from
Eq. (21) implies I = Smax = 0. Hence a noncontextual system can
only be explained by a deterministic and consistently connected
hidden variable theory. Complete characterization of hidden variable models underlying any possible system of measurements (in
sense of contextuality) is provided below in Table 6.
Having developed general framework of quantifying some features of theory underlying contextual system, we next discuss
some instances in this respect. We now sketch hidden variable
models interpreting correlations corresponding to a few existing
contextual systems of measurements.

5.1. Models for truly contextual data set (Cervantes & Dzhafarov,
2018)
System of measurements corresponding to N1 is inconsistently
connected(t = 4). The correlations violate Eq. (16), amount of
violation V1 = 0.452. N1 , being truly contextual, degrees of
indeterminism(I ), minimum and maximum inconsistent
connectedness (Smin , Smax ) of underlying theory must satisfy one
of the conditions given by Eqs. (24), (27), (28), (29), (30). An
indeterministic hidden variable model explaining N1 is given by
Table 7
For this model (Table 7), I = 0.5, Smin = 0 and Smax =
0.58375.
As V1 = 0.452, the parameters(I , Smin , Smax ) corresponding
to this model satisfy Eq. (28).

As for the first two indeterministic models corresponding to N1 and N2 , let
the binary valued hidden variable be associated with tossing of a biased coin
such that ‘Head’ (λ = λ1 ) now occurs with probability 0.10 whereas ‘Tail’
(λ = λ2 ) come with probability 0.90. Details of the conditional probability terms
appearing in the consistently connected hidden variable model compatible with
N3 are given here.

Table 9
As considered previously for N1 , let hidden variable λ denote a binary valued
random variable associated with output of a biased coin toss with now ‘Head’
occurring(λ = λ1 ) with probability 0.13 whereas ‘Tail’ (λ = λ2 ) occurs with
probability 0.87. Conditional probability terms compatible with N2 (Aerts et al.,
2018a) are enlisted in this table. This table is to be read in the same way as

contextual data. So, I and Smax of any hidden variable model must
satisfy one of the relations given by Eq. (33).
Table 11 gives an indeterministic and consistently connected
theoretical model for N3 . For that model, I ≃ 0.46 and Smax = 0.
First relation given by Eq. (33) is satisfied by this model.
It has already been discussed before that a consistently connected system can be explained by inconsistently connected theory. Next we provide a deterministic model explaining N3 (see
Table 12). As V1 ̸ = 0, so a deterministic model describing N3 must
be inconsistently connected. For this model (Table 12), I = 0 and
Smax = 1, hence satisfies second restriction of Eq. (33).

A deterministic model corresponding to N1 is given by Table 8.
Here, I = Smin = 0 and Smax = 1. For said value of V1 , all these
parameters satisfy Eq. (29).
5.2. Models for not truly contextual data set (Aerts et al., 2018a)
N2 is associated with an inconsistently connected system.
Correlations do not violate Eq. (16), hence not truly contextual.
But violation of Eq. (31) is observed: V1 = 0.471. System is thus
contextual due to direct influences. Degrees of indeterminism(I )
and maximum inconsistent connectedness (Smax ) of any model
compatible with N2 will satisfy any one of the criteria given by
Eq. (33). An indeterministic model is provided in Table 9. For this
model, I ≃ 0.5 and Smax = 0.76, hence satisfying second criterion
prescribed in Eq. (33). A deterministic model of N2 is given in
Table 10 for which I = 0 and Smax = 1. So for deterministic
model also second relation given by Eq. (33) is satisfied.

6. Concluding remarks
Observations of several psychophysical experiments point out
contextual nature of human decision making procedure. In earlier
times context dependence of human judgements, as revealed via
these experiments, was attributable to direct influences only. This
in turn gave rise to the intuition that human cognition is devoid
of true contextuality. The first counterintuitive observations were
reported in Cervantes and Dzhafarov (2018) where findings of
the experiments (based on simple decision makings in forms
of response to queries) ensured true contextual nature of the
same. In this respect, CbD theory (Dzhafarov, Kujala et al., 2016;

5.3. Model for consistently connected numerical data set (Aerts et al.,
2018b)
Correlations in N3 are consistently connected. Also N3 violates
Eq. (31): here V1 = 0.47. Consequently, N3 represents truly

Dzhafarov et al., 2016) helps in distinguishing true contextuality
from the other one. True contextuality thus turns out to be an
observable feature in some psycho physical experiments where
measurements involved are queries posed to human subjects.
Now, given a system of measurements, proper characterization of theory underlying any feature obtained at operational
level helps in better understanding of the system. Establishing connection between observed features (in experiments) with
that of suitable parameters characterizing corresponding theory
has motivated this manuscript. Broadly speaking, any theoretical explanation underlying observed data can be considered as
ontic level of discussion or hidden variable description of the
set of observed data. In this manuscript we have studied theory
compatible with any contextual cyclic-4 system of dichotomous
measurements.
Now, as in any other system of measurements (both in and
outside cognitive domain), correlations (observed data set) arising in contextual system are always explicable in terms of deterministic hidden variable theory. Determinism is the feature
characterizing the ontic level of discussion in that case. However alternate explanations (theoretical) of the same system are
possible considering some other features of the theory. For our
purpose we have considered the two features of indeterminism
and inconsistent connectedness. Suitable parameters are used
to measure these two notions. Concepts of indeterminism and
that of inconsistent connectedness maintain analogy with that
of uncertainty (randomness) and inconsistent connectedness of
correlations arising out of measurements.
Contextuality exhibited by cyclic-4 measurements in cognitive
domain can thus be explained by the general framework of theory
introduced here. In order to measure the degrees of indeterminism and inconsistent connectedness allowed by any theoretical
explanation of observed contextuality, we have derived upper
bound of violation of a noncontextual inequality (Eq. (16) in terms
of measures of these two notions (parameterizing the theory).
The bound in turn helps in establishing a direct link between
parameters characterizing observed data (amount of violation of
Eq. (16)) and that of the theory explaining such data.
The trade-off existing between the notions of indeterminism
and inconsistent connectedness (at ontic level) become evident
from our discussion. In case one tries to explain the contextual
system by a deterministic theory (I = 0), such an explanation
becomes inconsistently connected. Conversely, any possible consistently connected theoretical explanation (Smax = 0) of the same
data set can be made when the theory is indeterministic. Also any
intermediate theoretical explanation is feasible (see Table 6 for
a summary) in the sense that the theory is both indeterministic
and inconsistently connected, with the degrees of these quantities being dependent on amount of violation of the contextual
inequality (feature at operational level). At this point, it may be
noted that all these types of theoretical explanations are alternate
ways of interpreting the same observed data. Consequently up
to the measures currently used, searching for the optimal theoretical explanation from all these turns out infeasible. As these
two parameters are not operational features, so these become
incomparable as resources. So in order to find out minimal theory,
one needs to first introduce a suitable resource theoretic notion
to compare these based on which theory requiring the minimum
resource can be considered as the most suitable one. Developing
such a notion lies beyond the scope of our present work and can
be considered as a direction of future research.
Framework provided here can explain true contextuality and
that due to direct influences. Theory developed in explaining
nonclassicality exhibited by quantum correlations showing Bell–
CHSH violation comes as a special case of the framework given
here. This in turn tightens the analogy between study of quantum
theory and that of human psychology.

It may be pointed out here that our analysis involves only
cyclic-4 system of measurements. It will be interesting to characterize the theory explaining contextual system of measurements
in general. Besides, apart from indeterminism and inconsistent
connectedness, inclusion of other characteristics such as measurement independence of the theory is also a potential direction
of future research.
Appendix
Proof of Theorem 1. We consider a given cyclic-4 system of
measurements (M). As already discussed in the main text, the four
connections in this system are {R11 , R41 }, {R12 , R22 }, {R23 , R33 } and
{R34 , R44 } where each of the random variables Rcq is binary valued
(±1).
Let {σ (λ), Γ } be any hidden variable model of the given system of measurements M. Let I , Smin and Smax denote the degree of
indeterminism, minimum and maximum degrees of inconsistent
connectedness allowed by the model {σ (λ), Γ }.
U4 (Eq. (4)), can be written as:

∫
U4 =

Γ

(U4 )λ σ (λ)dλ

(34)

with
(U4 )λ = (CHSH)λ − (∆4 )λ .

(35)

where
(∆4 )λ = |⟨R11 ⟩λ − ⟨R41 ⟩λ | + |⟨R12 ⟩λ − ⟨R22 ⟩λ |

+ |⟨R23 ⟩λ − ⟨R33 ⟩λ | + |⟨R34 ⟩λ − ⟨R44 ⟩λ |

(36)

and
(4)

(CHSH)λ = Sodd (⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ , ⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ , ⟨R33 R34 ⟩λ , ⟨R41 R44 ⟩λ ).

(37)

For ease of notations, let us introduce the followings:
Pr [R11 = +1|λ] = µ1
Pr [R12 = +1|λ] = ν1
Pr [R22 = +1|λ] = ν2
Pr [R23 = +1|λ] = µ2
Pr [R33 = +1|λ] = µ3
Pr [R34 = +1|λ] = ν3
Pr [R44 = +1|λ] = ν4
Pr [R41 = +1|λ] = µ4

(38)

Using these notations, Eq. (36) implies:
(∆4 )λ = 2(|µ1 − µ4 | + |ν1 − ν2 | + |ν3 − ν4 | + |µ2 − µ3 |)

(39)

Clearly, (∆4 )λ is bounded by degrees of inconsistent connectedness allowed by the theory:
2tSmin ≤ (∆4 )λ ≤ 2tSmax , ∀ λ

(40)

So,
2t Smin ≤ ∆4 ≤ 2t Smax .
Next, let us consider the term (CHSH)λ given by Eq. (37).
(4)
According to the definition of the function Sodd , we have:
(i)

(CHSH)λ = Maxi {(CHSH)λ }, where,
(1)

(CHSH)λ = ⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ + ⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ + ⟨R33 R34 ⟩λ − ⟨R41 R44 ⟩λ
(2)

(CHSH)λ = ⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ + ⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ − ⟨R33 R34 ⟩λ + ⟨R41 R44 ⟩λ
(3)

(CHSH)λ = ⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ − ⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ + ⟨R33 R34 ⟩λ + ⟨R41 R44 ⟩λ

in D1 ∪ D2 and each of |µ1 − µ4 |, |µ2 − µ3 |, |ν1 − ν2 | and |ν3 − ν4 |
is bounded in between Smin and Smax . Now, depending on the
relation between I and Smax , we consider the following cases:

• Case1: Smax < 1 − 2I .
• Case2: Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .

(42)

For each of these two possible cases, we next derive the lower
bound for L′i ∀ i.
We start with Case.1. In this case, for each pair {µ1 , µ4 },
{µ2 , µ3 }, {ν1 , ν2 } and {ν3 , ν4 }, both the elements lie in same
subinterval D1 or D2 . So, Smin < I

where qi , q′i are the properties measured in same context i. By
Eqs. (38), (43), we get:

⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ = 1 + 4p1 − 2(µ1 + ν1 ).
⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ = 1 + 4p2 − 2(µ2 + ν2 ).

R41 R44 λ

Subcase.1: Let µ4 , ν4 lie in same subinterval D1
|µ4 + ν4 − 1| ≥ 1 − 2I . Equality occurs for µ4
(or 1 − I ). Hence L′1 ≥ 1 − 2I + t Smin . Equality
µ1 = ν1 = I − Smin , µ2 = ν2 = I , µ3 = ν3
µ4 = ν4 = I .

(44)

Now positivity of probability terms guarantee:
pi ≥ 0
µi ≥ pi
νi ≥ pi
pi ≥ µi + νi − 1

Subcase.2: µ4 and ν4 lie in different subintervals. W.L.O.G, let
µ4 ∈ D1 and ν4 ∈ D2 . Then, by criterion of Case.1, µ1 ∈ D1 and
ν3 ∈ D2 , i.e., they must lie in different subintervals.
Subsubcase.1: Let µ2 , ν2 lie in same subinterval. Then, by criterion
of Case.1, µ3 , ν1 must lie in same subinterval. Hence, µ2 , ν2 , µ3 ,
ν1 all lie in same subinterval, i.e., either all of these lie in D1 or
in D2 . If they lie in D1 , then µ3 and ν3 lie in different subintervals
(as ν3 ∈ D2 ). Then |µ3 − ν3 | ≥ 1 − 2I . Again if µ2 , ν2 , µ3 , ν1 lie in
D2 , then µ1 and ν1 lie in different subintervals (as ν1 ∈ D1 ). Then
|µ1 − ν1 | ≥ 1 − 2I . So combining these two possibilities, we get
|µ1 − ν1 | + |µ3 − ν3 | ≥ 1 − 2I . Hence, L′1 ≥ 1 − 2I . One instance
of equality: µ1 = ν1 = I , µ2 = ν2 = I − Smin , µ3 = I , ν3 = 1 − I ,
µ4 = I − Smin and ν4 = 1 − I + Smin .

Combining all of the above four relations, we get: Min{µi , νi } ≤
pi ≤ Max{0, µi + νi − 1}. Consequently Eq. (44) implies:
2|µ1 + ν1 − 1| ≤ ⟨R11 R12 ⟩λ ≤ 1 − 2|µ1 − ν1 |.
2|µ2 + ν2 − 1| ≤ ⟨R23 R22 ⟩λ ≤ 1 − 2|µ2 − ν2 |.
2|µ3 + ν3 − 1| ≤ ⟨R33 R34 ⟩λ ≤ 1 − 2|µ3 − ν3 |.
2|µ4 + ν4 − 1| ≤ ⟨R41 R44 ⟩λ ≤ 1 − 2|µ4 − ν4 |.

(45)

Combining all these together we get:

(CHSH)λ ≤ 4 − 2Li , where,

Subsubcase.2: Let µ2 , ν2 lie in different subintervals. Then
|µ2 − ν2 | ≥ 1 − 2I . Hence, L′1 ≥ 1 − 2I . One instance of equality:
µ1 = ν1 = 1 − I + Smin , µ2 = I , ν2 = 1 − I , µ3 = ν3 = I − Smin ,
µ4 = 1 − I and ν4 = I .
So, combining all possibilities, in Case.1, L′1 ≥ 1 − 2I . From
Eq. (47), it is clear that following similar strategy, it can be proved
that L′j (j = 2, 3, 4) ≥ 1 − 2I .
Next, we consider L′5 .

Clearly, deriving the upper bound for each of these (CHSH)λ (∀ i =

Eq. (35) we get:

As both µ3 ν3 are in same subinterval(D2 ), |µ3 + ν3 − 1| ≥ 1 − 2I .

For finding upper bound of (U4 )λ , we first derive lower bound of

1 − 2I . One instance of equality: µ1 = ν1 = I − Smin , µ2 = ν2 = I ,
µ3 = I − Smin , ν3 = 1 − I + Smin , µ4 = I and ν4 = 1 − I .
So combining all possibilities, in case.1, L′5 ≥ 1 − 2I . From
Eq. (47), it is clear that following similar strategy as for L′5 , it can
be proved that L′j (j = 6, 7, 8) ≥ 1 − 2I . Hence, in Case.1, ∀ i, lower
bound of L′i is 1 − 2I .
Next we consider Case.2, i.,e, Smax ≥ 1−2I . Here, ∀ i, Li has the
trivial lower bound 0, i.e., Li ≥ 0 where Li are given by Eq. (47).
Now, as Smax ≥ 1 − 2I , at least for some values of λ, and at least
one of the pairs {µ1 , µ4 }, {µ2 , µ3 }, {ν1 , ν2 } and {ν3 , ν4 } do not lie
completely in one of the two subintervals D1 or D2 , i.e., for at least
any of these four pairs, the components of the pair lie in different
subintervals D1 and D2 . Now as already discussed in the main text,

Subcase1: Smin < 1 − 2I . Then there exists a subset Γ1 (say) of
Γ such that ∀ λ ∈ Γ1 , at least one of the pairs {µ1 , µ4 }, {µ2 , µ3 },
{ν1 , ν2 } and {ν3 , ν4 } lies completely in one of the two subintervals.
But as Smax ≥ 1 − 2I , hence equality is not possible in the
inequality |µ1 − µ4 | + |µ2 − µ3 | + |ν1 − ν2 | + |ν3 − ν4 > t Smin .
Consequently,
L′i > t Smin , ∀ i.

(50)

Subcase.2: Smin ≥ 1 − 2I . Here, for any λ ∈ Γ , none of the
pairs {µ1 , µ4 }, {µ2 , µ3 }, {ν1 , ν2 } and {ν3 , ν4 } lies completely in
the same subinterval. Then |µ1 − µ4 | + |µ2 − µ3 | + |ν1 − ν2 | +
|ν3 − ν4 | has tight lower bound tSmin . But when equality is considered in |µ1 − µ4 | + |µ2 − µ3 | + |ν1 − ν2 | + |ν3 − ν4 ≥ tSmin ,
then none of Li = 0. Hence, here also the upper bound of L′i , ∀ i
is given by Eq. (50). So Eq. (50) provides upper bound for L′i in
Case.2
So, combining Case.1 and Case2, it can be concluded that for
each i = 1, 2..., 8:
L′i ≥ 1 − 2I + tSmin when Smax < 1 − 2I

> t Smin when Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .

(51)

By Eqs. (46), (48), (51), we get:
(U4 )λ < B(I , Smax , Smin ), ∀ λ ∈ Γ

(52)

where
B(I , Smax , Smin ) = 2 + 4I − 2t Smin when Smax < 1 − 2I

= 4 − 2t Smin when Smax ≥ 1 − 2I .

(53)

By Eqs. (34), (52), we get:
U4 < B(I , Smax , Smin ).

(54)

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

Free will has been at the heart of philosophical and scientific discussions for many years. However, recent ad­
vances in neuroscience have been perceived as a threat to the commonsense notion of free will as they challenge
two core requirements for actions to be free. The first is the notion of determinism and free will, i.e., decisions
and actions must not be entirely determined by antecedent causes. The second is the notion of mental causation,
i.e., our mental state must have causal effects in the physical world, in other words, actions are caused by
conscious intention.
We present the classical philosophical positions related to determinism and mental causation, and discuss how
neuroscience could shed a new light on the philosophical debate based on recent experimental findings. Overall,
we conclude that the current evidence is insufficient to undermine free will.

1. Introduction
Free will is tightly linked to the notion of volition and is a key feature
of human nature (Roskies, 2010): we exert our free will through
voluntary actions and decisions. Although the definition of free will is a
matter of debate in neuroscience and philosophy, our commonsense
experience of free will involves two core elements (Balaguer, 2009).
First, our decisions and actions must not be completely determined by
antecedent causes beyond our control. When facing a situation with
different alternatives (for instance, when deciding which gift we should
choose for a birthday or what meal we should have for lunch), an
intuitive way to consider that we have chosen freely is that we could
have done otherwise, all other conditions remaining the same. By
contrast, if our actions were completely determined by antecedent
causes, we could not have done otherwise, and hence we could not have
chosen freely. This notion will be later referred to as the problem of free
will and determinism (Honderich, 1990; Kane, 1998; Pereboom et al.,
2001). Second, from our everyday experience it would seem that our
mental state, and in particular our conscious intentions, can cause
physical events. For example, I want to grab this glass of water because I
am thirsty, and my conscious intention would thus cause my arm to
move toward the glass. How a mental event can cause a physical event
has been a longstanding question in philosophy and this second notion is
usually referred to as the problem of free will and mental causation

(Walter and Heckmann, 2003).
These two problems had been a subject of debate in philosophy of
mind for a long time before neuroscientists started to take position. Over
the last decades, advances in neuroscience have expanded the possibil­
ities for experimental investigations of these longstanding philosophical
questions. In this review, we first discuss free will and determinism and
then go onto discuss free will and mental causation. For each part, we
start by presenting a comprehensive review of the classical philosophical
positions of free will. We then consider how neuroscience could shed a
new light on these notions by reviewing recent experimental data.
Finally, we discuss the results from neuroscience, their limitations, and
consider their contribution to the philosophical debate.
2. Free will and determinism
2.1. Philosophical questions
For our actions to be free, they must not be entirely determined by
antecedent causes beyond our control. Although there is considerable
debate about this definition, an intuitive way is to consider our actions
free when we could have acted otherwise, all other conditions remaining
the same (Dennett, 2015; Frankfurt, 1969; Kane, 1998; Pereboom et al.,
2001). When we choose between two alternatives (for instance, staying
at home to read a book or going for a walk), we may have reasons to

prefer one to another, but we feel that our choice is free because
choosing one option rather than the other is not predetermined. We may
eventually decide to go for a walk, but equally could have chosen to stay
home to read a book instead. This in stark contrast to the physical world,
at least at a specific scale. For example, the physical laws that govern the
movements of particles entail a form of necessity. When we heat water
over 100 ◦ C, it starts boiling because it is determined by physical laws,
and it could not happen otherwise.
Determinism can be defined as follows: every physical event is
causally necessitated by prior events together with the causal laws of
physics (Balaguer, 2009; Kane, 1998; Pereboom et al., 2001; Roskies,
2006; Searle, 2001). If the universe is indeed deterministic, we lack free
will because everything, including our actions and decisions, is entirely
determined by a prior state of the universe together with physical laws
(Kane, 1998; Pereboom et al., 2001; Roskies, 2006). Accordingly, in the
same way that water necessarily boils when it is heated over 100 ◦ C, we
cannot act otherwise than we do. Contrasted philosophical positions
have emerged regarding this issue of free will and determinism (Roskies,
2006, 2010, 2012; Shadlen and Roskies, 2012). Compatibilists believe
that determinism is true, but that free will is compatible with deter­
minism (Bok, 1998; Frankfurt, 1971; Hume, 1960). For instance, ac­
cording to Hobbes, a person is free when they act in accordance with
their will and desires (Hobbes, 1962). Because will and desires can
themselves be determined by antecedent causes, this definition of
freedom is compatible with determinism. Thus, people are free unless
they cannot act according to their will, for instance when they are under
constraint, coercion, or when they suffer from compulsions or addic­
tions. From the compatibilist’s view, the ability to do otherwise, that is
central to free will, can be interpreted as follows: you could have done
otherwise if you had willed otherwise. By contrast, incompatibilists
believe that determinism precludes freedom, because they consider that
free will entails the ability to do otherwise all other conditions remaining
the same. This definition of free will is clearly incompatible with deter­
minism, because under the exact same circumstances, there is only one
possible outcome according to the definition of determinism. This leads
to two distinct philosophical trends. On the one hand, hard incom­
patibilists accept determinism and conclude that we do not have free
will (Pereboom et al., 2001). On the other hand, libertarians believe that
we have free will because some events are indeterministic (Kane, 1998;
O’Connor, 1972). Indeed, following the discovery of quantum physics,
the introduction of probabilistic, as opposed to deterministic, laws
opened the possibility for indeterministic events in the universe (Con­
way and Kochen, 2006; Searle, 2001). However, indeterminism is also
full of inherent problems: it introduces the notion of randomness in our
behaviors, and consequently would seem to be incompatible with the
definition of free will (Balaguer, 2014; Ebert and Wegner, 2011; Kane,
1998; Pereboom et al., 2001; Roskies, 2006; Searle, 2001; Shadlen and
Roskies, 2012). Libertarians argue that even if probabilistic laws un­
derlie our decisions, it does not preclude the possibility of an agent
causing and controlling their actions. Probabilistic laws make our ac­
tions more or less probable, while leaving the eventual choice open
(O’Connor, 2022). Overall, the philosophical debate regarding free will
and determinism is not yet settled.

depend on our belief that the weather forecast predicts a sunny after­
noon or on our desire to stretch our legs after a long day at work. This
view is related to the conception of free will as a form of
decision-making. Free actions could be seen as a succession of
internally-generated decisions regarding what goal to pursue or what
action to perform (the “what” component), when to do it (the “when”
component), and whether to do it (the “whether” component) (Brass and
Haggard, 2008). When transposed to the laboratory, this results in the
so-called “free-choice” paradigm. Subjects are instructed to freely
choose between different actions (the “what” component, for instance,
between right- and left-hand movements); to decide the moment to
initiate the action (the “when” component); or to decide whether to
execute or to withhold their action (the “whether” component). These
conditions can then be compared with cases in which the action is
completely determined by external stimuli (stimulus-driven action),
instructing the subjects what action to perform, and when or whether to
perform it. The “free-choice versus stimulus-driven action” paradigm is a
good tool to investigate changes in brain activity associated with the
decision-making process and neural substrates of free choices, albeit
with some limitations (Bode et al., 2014; Haggard, 2008, 2019).
Thus, characterizing the neural mechanisms underlying free choice
should provide further insight into the question of determinism and free
will (Roskies, 2006, 2010, 2012; Searle, 2001). If it turns out that the
brain mechanisms underlying our free choices are entirely deterministic,
this would favor determinism and consequently threaten our common­
sense notion of free will. By contrast, if our decisions are due to inde­
terministic (random, stochastic) events in our brain, some libertarians
could take this evidence as proof that we have free will.
2.3. Results from neuroscience
Non-invasive neuroimaging and neurophysiological exploration
represent convenient and accurate approaches to characterize the
properties of brain networks associated with a particular event. We will
review the neuroscientific data about free will, here defined as “free
choice”.
2.3.1. Neuroanatomy of free choice
2.3.1.1. fMRI experiments. The previously described “free choice” pro­
tocol has been repeatedly used in functional MRI (fMRI) studies. Trials
in which the subjects can freely choose what, when or whether to
perform a given action have been compared with trials in which the
same action is completely determined by external cues. This comparison
led to the identification of brain regions and networks that are more
engaged in free-choice actions than in stimulus-driven actions (Haggard,
2008; Seghezzi et al., 2019; Seghezzi and Haggard, 2022; Zapparoli
et al., 2017). These studies have recently been reviewed and were the
subject of three meta-analyses (Seghezzi et al., 2019; Seghezzi and
Haggard, 2022; Zapparoli et al., 2017). In one of the reports, the “what”,
“when” and “whether” components were analyzed separately (Zapparoli
et al., 2017): the “what” component was associated with greater acti­
vation in the cingulum, the frontal middle gyrus, the supramarginal
gyrus, and the inferior triangular frontal gyrus; the “when” component
with greater activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA), the
middle frontal gyrus, and the inferior parietal lobule; and the “whether”
component with greater activation in the cingulum, the inferior orbital
frontal gyrus, the insula, and subcortical structures. These results were
confirmed in a study that directly contrasted each individual component
(“what”, “when” and “whether”) against the two others (Zapparoli et al.,
2018). In the two other meta-analyses, the three components (“what”,
“when”, and “whether’) were pooled. Self-generated actions, as
compared with stimulus-driven actions, were associated with stronger
activation in the middle cingulum, the middle and inferior frontal gyrus,
the SMA and pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), the anterior

2.2. Inputs from neuroscience
To examine how neuroscience can contribute to the discussion about
free will and determinism, we should examine how free will can be
operationalized for experimental studies. Freely willed actions are
typically defined as internally-generated or self-initiated, in contrast to
externally-triggered or stimulus-driven actions (Fried et al., 2017;
Haggard, 2008; Roskies, 2010; Seghezzi et al., 2019; Seghezzi and
Haggard, 2022). In front of a traffic signal, our behavior is externally
triggered: we stop when the light is red, and we go when it turns green.
By contrast, our decision to go for a walk rather than staying at home to
read a book is to all extents and purposes internally driven: it could

insula, the superior and inferior parietal lobules, and the cerebellum
(Seghezzi et al., 2019; Seghezzi and Haggard, 2022).
Intuitively, it would seem that we exert our free will at the moment
of the deliberation phase that precedes the decision and the action.
Movement execution and the underlying brain activity should be unaf­
fected by whether the movement was freely chosen or stimulus-driven.
In consequence, many of the previous fMRI studies addressing this

question did not use an event-related design, so that movement execu­
tion and preparation could not be disentangled in the analysis (Deiber
et al., 1991; Filevich et al., 2013; Forstmann et al., 2006; Hoffstaedter
et al., 2013; Lau et al., 2004; Mueller et al., 2007; van Eimeren et al.,
2006). By contrast, other studies focused on the preparation phase
rather than on movement execution (Ariani et al., 2015; Krieghoff,
2009; Zapparoli et al., 2018). We recently tackled this question in a free
Fig. 1. “Free choice” task: identification of the brain
activity underlying free choice.
(A) Organization of a trial. During the delay period,
the subject had to prepare the forthcoming movement
(right-hand movement or bimanual movement) that
was either stimulus-driven or freely chosen. In the
stimulus-driven situation, a first cue indicated to the
subject which movement to perform (right-hand or
bimanual). In the free-choice condition, the decision
was up to the participants. After the “Go” signal, the
subject had to execute the prepared movement. (B) By
comparing the trials in which the movement was
freely chosen by contrast to stimulus-driven, we can
identify the anatomical location brain areas more
activated during freely chosen as compared to
stimulus-driven movements during the preparation
phase (red) and execution phase (purple). By contrast,
some regions were more activated during stimulusdriven movements during the execution phase (light
blue).

choice experiment, in which we analyzed movement preparation and
execution separately (Welniarz et al., 2021). During the preparation
phase, participants were asked to prepare either a right-hand or
bimanual movement. The selection between these two possibilities was
either freely chosen or stimulus-driven by an external cue. During the
execution phase, the participants had to execute the prepared movement
after a “Go” signal (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, the temporal window we used
in this fMRI analysis is questionable. Because free will lies in the ability
to do otherwise, the deliberation phase should theoretically extend up to
the “point of no return”, immediately preceding the movement’s onset.
None of the aforementioned studies used such a temporal window to
contrast internally-generated and externally-cued movements.
In our study, we confirmed that the preparation of freely-chosen as
compared to stimulus-driven movements was associated with increased
activity in several brain regions, including the preSMA, the middle
cingulum, the anterior cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, the
middle frontal gyrus, and the insula (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we found
that, compared with externally-cued movements, the execution of the
freely-chosen movements was associated with different patterns of brain
activity. We found increased fMRI signals in the inferior parietal
cortices, the SMA, the cerebellum, and frontal lobe areas (Fig. 1B). Using
connectivity analyses, we showed that freely-chosen movements
involved increased connectivity between the inferior parietal cortex and
the cerebellum. We suggest that the execution of freely-chosen move­
ments is associated with functional interaction in a network that mon­
itors the congruence between the intentional content of our actions and
their outcomes.

or an excess of involuntary actions (Desmurget and Sirigu, 2012; Fried
et al., 2017; Haggard, 2008; Hallett, 2007, 2016; Seghezzi and Haggard,
2022). Lesions of the preSMA have been associated with a decrease in
self-initiated actions in non-human primates and humans (Krainik et al.,
2004; Laplane et al., 1977; Nachev et al., 2008; Passingham, 1987;

contrast, lesions of the SMA and parietal cortex can result in involuntary
movements of the contralateral hand, a phenomenon known as “alien
hand syndrome”. A unilateral lesion of the SMA results in involuntary
movements in response to external cues: patients automatically reach
for objects that are in the visual space contralateral to the lesion. Lesions
of the parietal cortex result in purposeless movements without any
intention, such as “hand levitation” or “hand wandering”, in the absence
of an external cue (Assal et al., 2007; Desmurget and Sirigu, 2012; Fried
et al., 2017; Hassan and Josephs, 2016). Conversely, psychiatric disor­
ders manifesting an abnormal experience of free will, such as schizo­
phrenia, are associated with altered activity of the parietal cortex. In the
passivity phenomenon, self-generated actions and thoughts are experi­
enced as being external. Passivity symptoms in schizophrenic patients
and healthy individuals correlate with an increased activity in the pa­
rietal cortex and cerebellum (Blakemore et al., 2003; Schnell et al.,
2008; Spence et al., 1997). This misattribution of internally-generated
movements or thoughts in schizophrenic patients could originate from
a failure to predict the sensory consequence of their own actions (Bansal
et al., 2018).
In conclusion, our ability to choose freely does not rely on a single
brain region, but rather on a widespread network of which the SMA, the
anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, and the cere­
bellum are key nodes (Haggard, 2008; Pesaran et al., 2008; Welniarz
et al., 2021).

2.3.1.2. Electrophysiology. Electrophysiology experiments have also
contributed to the description of the brain regions underlying selfinitiated actions. EEG recordings in healthy subjects have consistently
identified a negative potential that precedes voluntary movements by
approximately 1 s: the readiness potential (RP) (Dirnberger et al., 1998;
Kornhuber and Deecke, 1965; Shibasaki and Hallett, 2006). The RP has
long been considered as an important brain signal for the generation of
voluntary movements, although this classical view has recently been
challenged (see Section 2) (Schurger et al., 2021). The early component
(approximately 1500–400 ms before movement onset) consists of a slow
and gradual negativity which is generated by the preSMA, further
indicating a role of this region in brain activation related to free choice.
The role of the SMA in the generation of the early component of the RP
was confirmed by intracranial recordings of single neurons (Fried et al.,
2011). By contrast, the late component (400-0 ms prior to movement
onset) is generated by the primary motor cortex (Haggard, 2008; Ros­
kies, 2010; Shibasaki and Hallett, 2006; Yazawa et al., 2000). However,
neurostimulation studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
or transcranial direct cortical stimulation (tDCS) showed that stimula­
tion of the primary motor cortex failed to influence hand selection in a
free-choice task (Sohn et al., 2003; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2019).
Thus, modulating the excitability of the final effector of the motor
pathway does not influence the voluntary generation of movements. In
addition, electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates
comparing free and externally-cued choices led to the identification of
the parietal cortex as a key region for free choice (Cui and Andersen,
2007; Pesaran et al., 2008).

2.3.2. Neural mechanisms of free choice
The association of free will (as operationalized in neuroscience) with
a specific brain activity is not surprising for the scientists and philoso­
phers who accept ontological physicalism, particularly for those who
think that mental properties supervene on physical properties. Accord­
ing to this view, the relation between mental and physical events goes
beyond a mere covariation. Mental events are dependent on, and
determined by, physical events in the brain. But these results give us no
direct answer regarding the question of determinism and free will. We
need to delve deeper into the neural mechanisms that underlie free
choice to see whether these processes are deterministic or
indeterministic.
Our current understanding of the neural mechanisms of decisionmaking largely relies on electrophysiological studies in non-human
primates. The general framework was first set by the study of percep­
tual decision-making in monkeys, where the animal has to make a de­
cision between different possibilities based on sensory evidence (Gold
and Shadlen, 2007). Presented with a cloud of dots randomly moving on
a screen, the monkey has to determine the direction of the net motion
and then has to make an ocular saccade in the same direction to indicate
its response. According to the “accumulation-to-bound” model, the
different possible responses are represented by different neuronal pop­
ulations in the lateral interparietal area that is part of the posterior
parietal cortex. The firing rate of these groups of neurons encodes the
accumulation of sensory evidence until one of them reaches a threshold
that triggers the response (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Roskies, 2010). This
model was then extended to more complex situations, and it can be
assumed that the neurons’ firing rate can encode various aspects of the
decision-making process such as the expected value of the outcome and
its probability (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Roskies, 2010; Shadlen and
Roskies, 2012).
If we consider free will in the sense of self-generated actions, the
decision should be triggered by internal factors rather than sensory
evidence. The accumulation-to-bound model may be applied in the
context of free choice, i.e., in the absence of external evidence that could

2.3.1.3. Lesion studies. Neuropsychology investigates brain functions
by studying behavioral modifications induced by cerebral damage to
specific regions. In this way we can identify the regions of the brain that
are involved in a functional network underlying a specific cognitive
function (Vaidya et al., 2019). The aforementioned fMRI and electro­
physiological studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex (in particular the
SMA and preSMA) and the parietal cortex are strongly involved in the
generation of voluntary actions. Accordingly, lesions of these two re­
gions are associated with either a decrease in self-initiated movements

be used to determine the action (Bode et al., 2014; Brass et al., 2019;
Murakami et al., 2014; Roskies, 2010; Schurger et al., 2016). In such
cases, what kind of internal signal could be used to make the decision?
Electrophysiological experiments in humans, non-human primates, and
rodents indicate that when external evidence is lacking or ambiguous,
the accumulation of stochastic neural noise makes the signal cross the
decision threshold (Brass et al., 2019; Murakami et al., 2014; Roskies,
2010; Schurger et al., 2012, 2016). In this regard, free choice would rely,
at least partially, on random neuronal noise, and may not be entirely
deterministic. Libertarians would consider this as sufficient proof in
favor of free will, whereas others would consider that randomness is as
incompatible with free will as determinism (Shadlen and Roskies, 2012).
Although it may be hard to consider that noise and free will are
compatible, these scientific results suggest that there is no contradiction
between stochastic neural activity and intentional action.
Another line of research suggests that in the absence of external
evidence, free will is a result of the accumulation of contextual evidence
rather than of neuronal noise. Contextual evidence could include the
task instruction or the history of recent choices, even if this kind of in­
formation is usually not consciously monitored (Bode et al., 2014;
Hwang et al., 2017; Mochizuki and Funahashi, 2014). In contrast with
the previous consideration relating to random neuronal noise, the notion
of contextual evidence suggests that the neural substrates of free choice
are deterministic. According to incompatibilists, such a conclusion
would preclude free will.

understood as the ability to do otherwise (Bigenwald and Chambon,
2019; Yaffe, 2022). In a famous example from Frankfurt (1969), a per­
son has a choice between two options A and B. However, a device is
installed in their brain, such that if the person chooses A on their own
nothing happens, but if the person chooses B then the device is activated
and makes the person choose A instead. It is argued that in the situation
where the person chooses A on their own they can be held morally
responsible for their choice even though they could not have done
otherwise (because if the person had chosen B the device would have
been activated making them choose A). Thus, what is relevant for moral
responsibility is a compatibilist account of free will: that the person
acted intentionally, made the choice based on their reasons, was the
source of the action, and had sufficient insight to consider the conse­
quences of the action (Bigenwald and Chambon, 2019; Meynen, 2010;
Yaffe, 2022). For instance, it is often considered that mental disorders
compromise legal responsibility, because the affected patient cannot be
considered as the genuine source of their actions (Meynen, 2010). The
input from neuroscience could be to provide an assessment of the mental
states that are relevant for this definition of legal responsibility (Aharoni
et al., 2008): firstly, by evaluating the ability of the person to act
intentionally and for a reason; secondly, by assessing whether they can
be considered as the source of the action; and, thirdly, by determining
the person’s ability to know the nature and quality of the act and to
know that the act is wrong, a faculty which, when absent, can lead to the
qualification of “insanity”. Using the right experimental task, neuro­
imaging studies can explore the regions of the brain that are necessary
for intentional action, for awareness of intention, and for the formation
of moral judgment (Aharoni et al., 2008). An altered activity or structure
in any of these regions could be taken as an argument for a defendant to
be considered as non-responsible. However, these approaches suffer
from important limitations that will be described in further detail at the
end of Section 2. Of note, most of the aforementioned studies are based
on correlations between brain activity and a particular cognitive func­
tion. In consequence, we still lack definitive evidence that the identified
brain regions are necessary for the functions required to establish moral
responsibility. The current state of neuroscience is thus unable to pro­
vide a reliable way of assessing whether a particular individual meets
the required conditions for legal responsibility (Aharoni et al., 2008;
Bigenwald and Chambon, 2019).

2.4. Can neuroscience enlighten the philosophical debate regarding free
will and determinism?
The picture that emerges from the studies of the neuronal mecha­
nisms underlying free choice leaves us with two options. On one hand,
that the neuronal substrates of free choice are fundamentally indeter­
ministic as they rely on random neuronal noise (Brass et al., 2019;
Roskies, 2010; Schurger et al., 2012, 2016, 2021). On the other hand,
that our so-called “free choice” could be the result of an accumulation of
unconscious contextual evidence, a view that leans toward determinism
(Bode et al., 2014). However, both approaches are problematic. If the
neural mechanisms that underlie our free decisions are deterministic,
then it clearly precludes free will, at least for incompatibilists. By
contrast, if the neural underpinnings of free choice are taken to be
indeterministic, this provides evidence in favor of free will from a lib­
ertarian’s point of view. However, some would argue that indeter­
minism is just as problematic as determinism because randomness is not
the same as free will. The conclusions and interpretation of these
experimental data have given rise to several objections.
First, the experimental setup used to investigate free will has its
limitations. We will go into these criticisms in detail at the end of the
second section. Second, neuroscience may not hold the definitive answer
regarding the fundamental nature of brain processes (Bode et al., 2014;
Roskies, 2006, 2010, 2022). Indeed, even if some neuronal events
appear to be deterministic or indeterministic at a certain level, the
complexity of brain wiring and the epistemic limitations of neurosci­
entific techniques preclude us from drawing any definitive conclusion
(Roskies, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2022; Shadlen and Roskies, 2012). Even if
determinism is an empirical question, the answer might lie in funda­
mental physics rather than in neuroscience (Roskies, 2010). Overall, it
would seem that neuroscience cannot provide us with a definitive
answer regarding the question of determinism and free will. By contrast,
a compatibilist’s account of free will requires that we act according to
our desires and reasons. Studying decision-making in healthy in­
dividuals and in individuals with disorders such as addiction, compul­
sion, or delusion could provide insights into the brain mechanisms that
are required to act according to our desires. This could shed light on the
compatibilist kind of free will and could therefore contribute to the field
of law and responsibility (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022). Indeed, legal and
moral responsibility can be considered as independent from free will

3. Free will and mental causation
3.1. Philosophical questions
We will now discuss the second aspect of free will: mental causation.
Mental causation signifies that mental states can cause physical events.
Consider that you want to grab a glass of water on the table because you
are thirsty. In such a case, we experience the fact that our conscious
intention, the phenomenal “feel” associated with this intention, seems to
be the cause of our movement toward the glass. This subjective expe­
rience or phenomenal feel is of great importance as it is the foundation of
our feeling of free will (Fried et al., 2017; Haggard, 2008; Hallett, 2007,
2016). Phenomenal consciousness is thought to have an intrinsic value
that adds an important degree of freedom to our behaviors (Cleeremans
and Tallon-Baudry, 2022). Conversely, this definition of consciousness
has also been criticized (Hacker, 2012). This topic is not new in phi­
losophy of mind, and many authors have pointed out that mental
causation is a crucial feature for human agency and free will (Chalmers,
1996; Fodor, 1989; Harbecke, 2008; Kim, 2005; Pockett et al., 2009;
Shields, 2014). Because mental and physical properties are of a different
nature, the main question that arises is how a mental event can cause a
physical event. The philosophical solutions that have been proposed to
answer the issue of mental causation strongly depend on one’s position
regarding mind-brain ontology, i.e., the nature of the relation between
the mind and the physical (Fig. 2) (Harbecke, 2008). We will thus clarify
the position we assume regarding this philosophical question. Like
5

Fig. 2. Different ontological conceptions of the mind-body problem.
Substance dualism refers to an ontology in which the mind and the body are distinct substances with different properties. (A) Interactionalism is a form of substance
dualism where immaterial minds can interact with physical bodies, and thus cause effects in the physical world. (B) In occasionalism, there is no interaction between
the mind and the body, and the coherence between the two is the result of God’s action.
In contrast to substance dualism, physicalism states that the universe is composed of bits of matter and their aggregates, and that there is no such thing as immaterial
mind, soul or spirit. (C) Non-reductive physicalism is a type of substance physicalism that embraces mind body supervenience, i.e., the idea that mental events are
determined by and dependent on physical events in the brain. However, this position states that mental events are not reducible to physical events. (D) Reductive
physicalism, by contrast, considers that mental events are reducible to physical events. Mental events are “nothing more” than physico-chemical events occurring in
the brain.

nearly all neuroscientists and many philosophers, we accept physi­
calism. This ontology states that the universe is composed uniquely of
atoms, molecules, and their aggregates. There is no such thing as
immaterial souls or spirits. In addition, many, if not all, physicalists
embrace mind-body supervenience, i.e., “the claim that what happens in
our mental life is wholly dependent on, and determined by, what hap­
pens with our bodily process” (Kim, 1993, 2005). Mental properties are
grounded in the physical world, and the relation between the two goes
beyond a mere covariation. Mental events such as intentions are
dependent on, and determined by, physical events in the brain.
Some have argued that mental causation entails a form of substance
dualism, as it seems to suggest that our intentions are driven by nonphysical substances (spirits or souls) that are distinct from our body
but can nevertheless cause them to move (Haggard, 2008; Haggard and
Libet, 2001; Seghezzi and Haggard, 2022). This view was inherited from
Descartes’s substance dualism, considering minds as immaterial sub­
stances that can interact with the physical brain to cause an action
(Fig. 2A) (Popper et al., 1977). While being rather intuitive, this concept
would preclude mental causation. Indeed, how could an immaterial
substance with no spatial extension enter in causal relation with a

material substance (Harbecke, 2008; Kim, 2005)? In Descartes’ time,
Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia famously argued: “How can the mind of
man determine the bodily spirits in producing voluntary actions, being
only a thinking substance?” (Garber, 2000). Occasionalism, another
form of substance dualism defended by Malebranche, denies any causal
relation between the mind and the body. Rather, the two substances
exist in parallel, and the apparent causation from the mental to the
physical is due to God (Fig. 2B). If substance dualism is ruled out, we are
left with two forms of monism, i.e., the view that there is only one kind
of substance: absolute idealism and ontological physicalism. Absolute
idealism is the idea that the nature of reality is spiritual. Although
progress in science has rendered this position less popular, it has its
defenders (Hutto, 2000). By contrast, physicalism is the view that the
universe is uniquely composed of atoms and their aggregates. Within
this physicalist framework, there are two main philosophical positions
that account for mental causation. On one hand, according to reductive
physicalism, at least some mental properties are reducible to physical
properties (Kim, 2005). This means that mental events are “nothing
more” than physical events in the brain such as electric currents and the
release of synaptic neurotransmitters (Fig. 2D). On the other hand,
6

C. Delnatte et al.

Neuropsychologia 188 (2023) 108632

non-reductive physicalism (or emergentism) states that the mind su­
pervenes on the physical, but that mental properties are not reducible to
physical properties (Chalmers, 1996; J. Fodor, 1997; Putnam, 1975;
Searle, 2001). According to this view, although there is nothing more
than physical matter, mental events cannot be explained purely by the
description of physical events occurring in the brain (Fig. 2C). Reductive
and non-reductive physicalism are both committed to ontological
physicalism (the fact that there are only physical substances). Still, one
of them rejects the idea that mental properties are reducible to physical
properties, while the other one embraces it. Both of them consider
mental causation as a crucial feature. In the case of reductive physi­
calism, mental causation is straightforward. Because mental properties
are reducible to physical properties, causation from a mental event (the
intention to raise my arm) to a physical event (the actual movement of
my arm) comes down to causation from a physical event (the brain ac­
tivity that determines my intention to raise my arm) to another physical
event (the actual movement of my arm) (Kim, 2005). By contrast,
considering mental causation from the point of view of non-reductive
physicalism is more challenging. Indeed, because mental properties
emerge from physical properties but are not reducible to these physical
properties, mental causation entails a “downward causation” from the
higher-level emerging states (such as mental states) to the lower-level
physical states (Harbecke, 2008; Kim, 1993; Walter and Heckmann,
2003). However, according to the “exclusion argument” non-reductive
physicalism and mental causation are incompatible (Fig. 3) (Kim,
1993, 2005). To reach his conclusion, Kim uses two other principles that
both reductive and non-reductive physicalists would willingly accept: (i)
the causal closure of the physical: any physical event that has a cause at a
moment “t” has a sufficient physical cause at “t”; and (ii) the exclusion
principle: a physical event cannot have two distinct and sufficient causes
at the same time. Briefly, the exclusion argument goes as follows: let us
suppose that a mental event “M” causes a physical event “e” at the
instant “t”. Because of the causal cloture, “e” also has a sufficient
physical cause “P” at “t” (P is the physical supervenience base of M). As a
premise of non-reductive physicalism, “M” and “P” are distinct, and
thus, “e” has two distinct and sufficient causes at “t”: “M” and “P”. But
given the exclusion principle, this is not possible, and hence, “M” has to

be discarded as a sufficient cause for “e”. Indeed, if we discard “P” as a
cause of “e”, then “e” would have M as a sufficient cause. Still, because M
is a mental event that is irreducible to a physical event, this would
violate the causal closure of the physical. This argument leaves us with
only two possibilities. On one hand, if one maintains that the mental is
irreducible to the physical, mental causation is impossible, and mental
events would be purely epiphenomenal. This means that, in the same
way as a shadow, mental events are caused by an underlying physical
event, but they are themselves deprived of any causal power. On the
other hand, embracing reductive physicalism would save mental
causation (Kim, 2005), and thus, like many neuroscientists, we favor
reductive physicalism (Hopkins et al., 2022). However, this line of
reasoning did not resolve the debate, and the validity of the exclusion
argument remains a topic of discussion (Walter and Heckmann, 2003).
For instance, the formulation of the exclusion principle has been criti­
cized using a different account of causation as “difference-making” (List
and Menzies, 2009). Regarding the causal closure of the physical, the
current theories in quantum physics argue against the existence of a
sufficient physical cause for every physical event (Conway and Kochen,
2006).
3.2. Inputs from neuroscience
Even if we decide to set aside the debate between reductive and nonreductive physicalism and take mental causation for granted, a new
“threat” has arisen from neuroscience. Over the last decades, many
studies have investigated the phenomenal aspect of volition, meaning
the subjective and conscious experience associated with intention.
Indeed, conscious intentions are accompanied by a specific subjective
experience, a phenomenal feel that subjects can report, and that can thus
be studied in different aspects: its relative timing with electrophysio­
logical signals related to movement; its manipulation by altering feed­
back processing, and its neural substrates. These experiments are
thought to give important insights as to whether our conscious in­
tentions can cause our movements. Many neuroscientists claim that the
results of the experiments described in the following section demon­
strate that conscious intentions are an illusion deprived of any causal

Fig. 3. The exclusion argument.
According to this argument, non-reductive physicalism and mental causation are incompatible. Let us consider that a mental event M1 causes a physical event P2.
Because of the causal closure of the physical, P2 has a sufficient physical cause, P1, which is the supervenient base of M1. Because M1 is not reducible to P1, P2 has
two distinct and sufficient causes: M1 and P1. In virtue of the exclusion argument this is not possible because otherwise P2 would be over-determined. Thus, M1 has
to be rejected as a sufficient cause for P2. According to this argument, non-reductive physicalism precludes mental causation and leads to epiphenomenalism, the fact
that mental events are deprived of causal powers.
M1: mental event 1; M2: mental event 2; P1: physical event 1; P2: physical event 2.

Fig. 4. Different theoretical possible outcomes of Libet’s experiments.
(A) According to Libet’s view, a physicalist’s position implies that the readiness potential (RP) precedes the conscious intention to move, because a mental state can
only be considered as a consequence, and not a cause, of brain activity. From this perspective, the conscious intention has no causal power in the generation of the
movement, and hence free will cannot exist. (B) In a dualist conception, where immaterial minds interact with our brain to cause our movements, we would expect
the conscious intention to precede any brain activity. This theoretical position is incompatible with experimental data. (C) According to another physicalist
conception, conscious intentions are mental events that are reducible to the neuronal decision process. Thus, mental events are determined by neuronal events. But,
in addition, in virtue of their reducibility to a neuronal event, conscious intentions can also be considered as the cause of movement initiation. In this scenario, we
would expect the conscious intention to be simultaneous with the neuronal decision to move. The most recent data on Libet’s experiment favor this view and suggest
that the early phase of the RP (that precedes the conscious intention) is in fact an artifact (red line) due to the averaging of random neuronal noise (green line). By
contrast, the relevant neuronal decision to move (that corresponds to a threshold crossing) seems to coincide with the conscious intention to move (W).

experiments in the 80’s (Libet et al., 1983). In this seminal study, par­
ticipants had to perform a pre-defined movement (a flexion of the wrist
or fingers) at a moment they were free to choose. As discussed above,
this is a way of operationalizing free will as self-initiated or spontaneous
movements, the participants being free to decide the “when” component
only. The authors then measured the relative timing of different events.
The beginning of the movement, which is called (M), was determined
using an EMG recording of corresponding arm muscles. During the

3.3. Results from neuroscience
3.3.1. Electrophysiology and timing of conscious intention
The first challenge to the intuitive notion that our conscious in­
tentions are causally efficacious came from Benjamin Libet’s
8

C. Delnatte et al.

experiment, the participants were looking at a revolving spot on a clock,
and they had to memorize the precise location of the spot at the moment
they became aware of their intention to move and report it after the
movement. This is the instant (W), or the “time of conscious intention to
act”. An EEG recorded the brain activity related to the movement. As
mentioned in the first section, voluntary movements are preceded by a
slow ramping negativity called the RP that is thought to reflect a specific
preparatory signal leading up to the movement (Kornhuber and Deecke,
1965; Shibasaki and Hallett, 2006). Libet found that the conscious
intention to move (W) preceded movement onset (M) by 200 ms. More
surprisingly, the beginning of the RP occurred several hundreds of
milliseconds before W (350 ms in Libet’s study, Fig. 4A). These results
have been replicated, and a recent meta analysis confirmed that in ex­
periments with a similar setup, the conscious intention to move (W)
occurs after the onset of the brain activity (beginning of the RP), with an
average delay of around 500 ms (Braun et al., 2021). A similar task
conducted in epileptic patients, where the brain activity in the medial
frontal areas could be precisely and directly recorded during the task
with intracranial electrodes, led to the same conclusion (Fried et al.,
2011; Haggard, 2011).
Thus, it would seem that the beginning of the brain activity causing
movement (the RP) starts before the participants become conscious of
their intention to move. Using the words of Libet: “the brain “decides” to
initiate or, at least, to prepare to initiate the act before there is any
reportable subjective awareness that such a decision has taken place”
(Libet, 1985). This temporal sequence would preclude that the partici­
pants’ conscious intention can be the cause of the RP, leading to the
conclusion that the conscious intention could not be the cause of the
movement (Haggard, 2008; Haggard and Libet, 2001; Hallett, 2007,
2016; Libet et al., 1983; Sinnott-Armstrong and Nadel, 2011). These
results have been interpreted as evidence that conscious intention is an
epiphenomenon that is deprived of any causal power regarding the
initiation of our movements, thus threatening our commonsense
conception of free will (Haggard and Libet, 2001; Libet, 1985; Libet
et al., 1983; Wegner and Wheatley, 1999).
Another set of experiments using online EEG analysis led to similar
conclusions (Bai et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2013). Using another EEG
signal, namely an event-related desynchronization in the beta frequency
bands and a learning algorithm, the authors were able to make online
predictions about a forthcoming movement more than 0.5 s before the
beginning of the muscle activity recorded by EMG (Bai et al., 2011). The
main difference between this experiment and Libet’s study is that there
was no need to average the EEG data across several trials: the prediction
was performed at a single-trial level. Using the same setup, the authors
then asked the subjects what they were thinking about at the time of the
prediction, before movement onset. While they did sometimes report an
intention to move, sometimes they did not (Schneider et al., 2013). This
further suggests that movements can be initiated unconsciously.

3.3.3. Conscious intention and feedback processing
Marc Jeannerod suggested that conscious intentions arise, at least in
part, from the processing of the sensory feedback generated by actions
(Jeannerod, 2009). The following experiments are based on how the
manipulation of feedback from the movement affects subjective reports
about the conscious intention to move. In a visuomotor task, healthy
participants were asked to draw a straight line on a graphic tablet. The
subjects were deprived of direct visual feedback of their own hand, but
they could see the line they were drawing on a screen. In some trials, the
line was deviated as compared to their actual movement, thus creating a
visuomotor conflict (Fourneret and Jeannerod, 1998). When the devi­
ation was mild, the participants unconsciously corrected their move­
ment to produce a straight line on the screen, i.e., compensating the
erroneous visual feedback. At higher levels of deviation, the participants
suddenly became aware of the deviation and consciously intended to
correct the trajectory of the line on the graphic tablet (Fourneret and
Jeannerod, 1998). A haptically deafferented patient who was physio­
logically deprived from proprioceptive feedback performed the same
task. This patient was unable to report any conscious intention to correct
her movements, or any conscious intention about her own acts (Four­
neret et al., 2002). Under such an experimental setting, the conscious
intention arises from the comparison between the expected movement
outcome and the actual sensory feedback generated by the action
(Fourneret et al., 2002; Fourneret and Jeannerod, 1998; Jeannerod,
2009). The forward model is central to this conception of motor control.
According to this model, when performing an action, a copy of the motor
command (called the “efference copy”) is used to predict the sensory
consequence of the movement. Brain regions (called “comparators”)
compare the efference copy with the sensory feedback generated by the
movement (Miall et al., 1993; D. Wolpert et al., 1995; D. M. Wolpert and
Ghahramani, 2000). In the visuomotor task described above, the par­
ticipants suddenly became conscious of their corrective movements
when they detected a discrepancy between the expected and actual
outcome of the movement. These results suggest that conscious inten­
tion is a post hoc phenomenon that is generated by the processing of the
sensory feedback from our action, thus reversing the intuitive causal
relation between intention and action (Eagleman, 2004; Jeannerod,
2009).
In keeping with these results, it has been shown that manipulation of
the sensory feedback generated by a movement could influence the re­
ported time of conscious intentions. For instance, in a variant of Libet’s
study, the participant’s movement was followed by an auditory tone
with a variable delay (Banks and Isham, 2009; Rigoni et al., 2010). It
was shown that W was delayed linearly with the delay between the
movement onset and the tone. In other words, a delay in the perceived
time of the action’s outcome resulted in a delay in the reported time of
conscious intention. In most of the trials, the subjects even reported W to
occur after the actual beginning of the movement. This demonstrates
that processes related to movement execution and feedback processing
can modulate the reported time of conscious intention.
In a TMS experiment, a pulse applied to the preSMA during or just
after action execution could influence the perceived onset of intention.
Conscious intention, which supposedly occurs before the movement,
may thus be influenced by a brain event that occurs after action
execution (Lau et al., 2007). Similarly, an EEG study using tDCS applied
to the left angular gyrus or to the primary motor cortex suggested that
the reported time of conscious intention is computed from a time period
that spans from 1 s before to a few hundreds of milliseconds after
movement onset (Douglas et al., 2015).
A recent study investigated the prospective and retrospective factors
that contribute to the formation of conscious intentions (Schultze-Kraft
et al., 2020). The authors used a brain computer interface and EEG
monitoring to detect the RP in real time at a single-trial level. The
computer then generated a cue that was triggered by the presence or
absence of an RP. The cue could indicate to move or to remain still. The
participants where then asked whether they had the intention to move at

3.3.2. fMRI and the timing of conscious intention
Libet’s findings have been replicated in a fMRI experiment (Soon
et al., 2008). Participants performed a Libet task while their brain ac­
tivity was measured with fMRI. They were asked to freely choose be­
tween right- and left-finger movements when they felt the urge to do so.
Participants watched a stream of letters on a screen and had to memorize
the letter that was displayed at the moment they became conscious of
their intention to move. Using statistical pattern recognition methods,
the authors showed that information predicting the forthcoming
movement was encoded in frontal and parietal regions as early as 8 s
before the subjects reported their conscious intention to move (Soon
et al., 2008). These findings were then replicated (Bode et al., 2011) and
expanded to abstract decisions where participants were free to choose
whether to add or subtract numbers (Soon et al., 2013). In accordance
with Libet’s findings, the authors concluded that unconscious brain
activity can precede and influence free choices several seconds before
they reach consciousness.

the time the cue was displayed. The main finding was that the partici­
pants were more likely to report an intention to move when the cue was
triggered by an RP and when they had just moved. The authors
concluded that conscious intentions rely on both prospective signals
linked to motor preparation and on retrospective signals associated with
action execution.
All together, these data suggest that the formation of a conscious
intention is at least partially retrospective as it relies on a post hoc pro­
cessing of events that occur after action execution. This reverses our
intuitive causal relation between intention and action, and is difficult to
conciliate with the idea that conscious intentions cause action.

action itself are produced by unconscious brain mechanisms, and the
experience of will is an illusion due to the perception of an apparent
causal link between the intention and the action.
From this perspective, what is the alleged role of conscious inten­
tion? Libet proposed that although conscious intentions have no causal
role in the initiation of action, the delay between W (the time we become
conscious of our intentions) and M (the beginning of the movement) was
sufficient to allow conscious intention to stop the ongoing preparation of
the movement (Libet, 1985). Thus, a conscious intention would exert a
“veto power”, and a “free will” would rather be a “free won’t” (Libet,
1985). For others, conscious intention is at the heart of another key
feature of human cognition: the sense of agency. Intention, as a
conscious representation of the action, includes a representation of the
goal to be achieved (Mylopoulos and Pacherie, 2019). The causal role of
a conscious intention could thus lie in the comparison between the
representation of that goal and the actual consequences of the action. A
conscious intention that matches the outcome of a movement results in
the subjective experience of being the author of the action, namely, the
sense of agency (Haggard, 2017; Hallett, 2007; Jeannerod, 2009).
However, before we accept these radical conclusions, we should
carefully examine the criticisms that have been voiced about these
studies. Libet’s results, in particular, have given rise to numerous com­
ments. We will review the main arguments that have been put forward
to undermine Libet’s conclusions, and we will see that they largely apply
to the other studies we previously mentioned.

3.3.4. Neuroanatomy of conscious intention
In a physicalist framework, conscious intentions, whether they have
a causal power or not, supervene on physical substrates.
In a seminal fMRI study, Lau and colleagues asked the participants to
perform a Libet task while focusing on their intentions or on their
movements (Lau et al., 2004). Paying attention to a specific cognitive
task is thought to increase the hemodynamic signal in the brain regions
dedicated to this specific function (Eagleman, 2004), although this hy­
pothesis has been criticized (Nachev and Husain, 2010). Paying atten­
tion to intentions resulted in an increased fMRI signal in three areas: the
preSMA, the dorsal prefrontal cortex, and the intraparietal sulcus (Lau
et al., 2004). These results overlap with data from electrical brain
stimulations performed during awake brain surgery. PreSMA stimula­
tion can give rise to an “urge” to move, and increasing stimulation in­
tensity can cause a movement (Fried et al., 1991). Interestingly,
movements elicited by preSMA stimulation were identified by the sub­
jects as their own, while the stimulation of the primary motor cortex
elicits movements that were perceived as external (Fried et al., 2017). By
contrast, stimulation of the inferior parietal lobule resulted in an
“intention” to move, but increasing stimulation intensity did not elicit
any movement, although some participants reported that they had the
feeling they actually moved (Desmurget et al., 2009; Desmurget and
Sirigu, 2012). In keeping with these results, anodal tDCS applied to a
specific parietal region (the left angular gyrus) to increase its excitability
can alter the reported time of movement intention in healthy individuals
(Douglas et al., 2015). Furthermore, different disorders have been
associated with an altered capacity to report the time of conscious
intention. When patients with cerebral lesions in the inferior parietal
lobule perform a Libet task, the reported time of their conscious inten­
tion (W) is much closer to movement onset as compared with healthy
volunteers (Sirigu et al., 2004), as in patients with functional movement
disorders (Fried et al., 2017). The latter patients also exhibit a hypo­
activation of the same region during abnormal movement (Voon et al.,
2010), suggesting a role of the angular gyrus in conscious intentions
(Fried et al., 2017).

3.4.2. Criticisms of the conclusions from neuroscience
The various kinds of criticism directed against Libet’s interpretation
have been reviewed elsewhere (Brass et al., 2019; Mele, 2009, 2014;
Neafsey, 2021; Roskies, 2011; Schurger et al., 2021; Shields, 2014).
They can be separated into two main types: technical and philosophical
(Roskies, 2011). The technical issues concern the robustness of the data,
the method used to report conscious intentions, and the nature of the RP.
The philosophical questions tackle the concept of mental causation, the
nature of W and the generalizability of the conclusions.
3.4.2.1. Technical comments
3.4.2.1.1. Robustness of the data. A first issue concerns the robust­
ness of the data from which Libet and others have drawn their conclu­
sions. Although Libet’s findings have been replicated, a recent metaanalysis points out that the evidence supporting these results is rather
thin. Indeed, the amount of data regarding the difference in timing be­
tween unconscious brain activity and conscious intention to move is in
fact limited, as it only corresponds to six studies with a total of 53
participants. This limited sample implies that the results should be
interpreted with caution (Braun et al., 2021).
3.4.2.1.2. The measure of W. Another question regards the validity
of the measure of W as a reflection of the time when the participants
become conscious of their intention to move. In Libet’s experiment, the
subjects have to remember the position of the spot at the moment they
become aware of the decision, but they report it only after they have
executed the movement. The cognitive operation of looking at the clock
while performing the task and remembering its position might be timeconsuming and could lead to measurement bias (Roskies, 2011). As
mentioned in the previous section, because W is reported after move­
ment execution, it could be influenced by a brain event that took place
after action execution (Banks and Isham, 2009; Douglas et al., 2015; Lau
et al., 2007). Another important question is to know whether the timing
of W can be influenced by the measurement method itself. Using a
variant of the Libet task, Matsuhashi and Hallett measured the moment
when the subjects started to think of their movement (instant “T”).
Rather than using retrospective reports of conscious intention, they
introduced a random auditory cue used to probe whether the partici­
pants were thinking about the movement at a given time. They showed
that the mean time of T was 1.42 s before movement onset, much earlier

3.4. Can neuroscience enlighten the philosophical debate regarding mental
causation?
3.4.1. Conclusions from neuroscience
These results have led many scientists to conclude that conscious
intentions have no causal role regarding the initiation of movement, and
that intuition regarding mental causation is in fact an illusion (Haggard,
2008; Hallett, 2007, 2016; Jeannerod, 2009; Libet, 1985; Wegner and
Wheatley, 1999). According to this view, conscious intention and action
should be seen as two separate, parallel causal chains without any actual
causal link between them (Hallett, 2007; Jeannerod, 2009; Wegner and
Wheatley, 1999). In keeping with this, conscious intentions have also
been conceived as a perception, i.e., a passive phenomenon deprived of
causal power regarding the generation of movement (Fried et al., 2017;
Hallett, 2007, 2016). The experience of will could be a post hoc inference
triggered by the movement and relying on a specific set of properties
between the intention and the action (Kühn and Brass, 2009; Wegner
and Wheatley, 1999). For Wegner, both conscious intentions and the
10

than the previous measures of W (Matsuhashi and Hallett, 2008).
Although on average the beginning of the RP still preceded T, T pre­
ceded the RP in four of the 15 subjects, thus undermining Libet’s results
(Brass et al., 2019; Neafsey, 2021).
3.4.2.1.3. The nature of the readiness potential. One of the main is­
sues regarding Libet’s conclusions concerns the interpretation of the RP.
An important and implicit assumption made by Libet is that the RP is the
result of a decision process that will eventually cause a movement (Brass
et al., 2019; Roskies, 2011). In other words, at RP onset the decision to
move has already been made unconsciously, and the RP reflects the
preparatory process that will generate the movement. This interpreta­
tion led Libet to conclude that the conscious intention that follows RP
onset has no causal role in initiating the movement (Mele, 2009).
However, that RP is a cause of the movement is an assumption that is
compatible with the possibility that a conscious intention, even occur­
ring later, is also a cause of the movement. The RP could be a remote
cause, while the conscious intention could be a more proximal cause
(Mele, 2009). This highlights the fact that Libet implicitly assumes that
the RP would have resulted in a movement even if the participants had
not acquired a conscious intention to act afterwards. In other words, the
RP is supposed to be a sufficient cause of the movement.
Direct evidence that the RP is necessary and sufficient to cause a
movement is still lacking. An important step would be to show that the
RP selectively occurs before a voluntary action, as suggested by a recent
work (Travers et al., 2020). However, because the amplitude of the RP is
weaker than neuronal noise, this signal is usually obtained from a large
number of trials that are time-locked back-averaged to the movement
onset. This procedure could lead to important artifacts (Roskies, 2011;
Schurger et al., 2021). A more direct method would be to detect RPs on
single trials and to show that they can predict subsequent movements.
However, both EEG and intracranial recordings failed to provide
compelling evidence supporting such a view. The main issue in the study
using online EEG recordings to predict movements at a single-trial level
(Bai et al., 2011) was accuracy. Sensitivity was below 50%, meaning
that the algorithm failed to anticipate more than half of the movements.
When a prediction was made, the false positive rate was around 30%, i.
e., 30% of the predictions were not followed by an actual movement.
Regarding the study using intracranial recordings of single neurons
(Fried et al., 2011), although the activity of single neurons averaged
over a large number of trials provided a ramping like activity resembling
the RP, such a clear signal was not apparent at the single-trial level
(Schurger et al., 2021). In addition, RPs can be detected in forms of
decision-making that do not require any movement, suggesting that the
RP is a more general signal that is not specifically related to movement
(Alexander et al., 2016). Conversely, a recent study showed an absence
of RP preceding a meaningful decision as compared with an arbitrary
decision, although a motor outcome was present in both cases (Maoz
et al., 2019). Thus, it would appear that the RP is neither necessary nor
sufficient to trigger the action.
An alternative hypothesis could be that the RP represents the process
causing the conscious intention, and not the movement. This would
seriously undermine Libet’s conclusion, because it means that a
conscious intention could be the cause of a brain process leading to the
movement (Roskies, 2011). However, investigations regarding the as­
sociation between the RP and conscious intention have resulted in
conflicting results. On one hand, the timing of the conscious intention
does not correlate with the timing of the RP, making it unlikely that the
former is caused by the latter (Haggard and Eimer, 1999; Schlegel et al.,
2013). In addition, it was shown that the RP was not influenced by
whether the subjects were conscious of the action or not, suggesting
once again that the RP is not the cause of the conscious intention (Keller
and Heckhausen, 1990; Schlegel et al., 2015). On the other hand, a
recent work using a real time EEG analysis method (described in the
previous section) showed that subjects were more likely to report an
intention to move in the presence of an RP, suggesting a causal link
between the two (Schultze-Kraft et al., 2020).

Another hypothesis suggests that the RP could reflect the brain ac­
tivity related to alternative possible movements that are not executed, a
theory known as affordance (Gibson, 1977; Nachev and Hacker, 2014).
The brain activity observed when preparing an action might not only be
only related to the movement that will actually be performed, but also to
the alternative possible movements that will not be executed. When
choosing “when” to execute a movement (such as in Libet’s task), the
widening of the distribution of neural activity (the RP) may reflect the
alternative possible timing of movement execution. From this perspec­
tive, it is impossible to determine at what point the brain activity is
causally responsible for the executed movement. Indeed, the neural
signal related to the actual movement cannot be disentangled from the
signals related to the alternative movements that will not be performed
(Nachev and Hacker, 2014).
A final hypothesis could be that the RP might be an artifact due to the
experimental instructions. However, a recent EEG study showed that RP
also occurred before spontaneous uninstructed movements (Houdayer
et al., 2020).
The most serious challenge to this interpretation of the RP as a
preparatory signal that is necessary and sufficient to cause voluntary
movements came from a study suggesting that it could be an artifact due
to the averaging of stochastic neuronal noise (Schurger et al., 2012). In a
standard Libet task, the participants performed a pre-defined movement
at a time they were free to choose. As described in the first part of this
review, the authors hypothesized that the free choice regarding the
timing of movement could be described with an accumulation-to-bound
model, where neuronal random noise is accumulated as evidence until it
reaches a threshold that triggers the decision to move. Using this
mathematical model, the authors showed that when random fluctua­
tions at a single-trial level are back-averaged from the time of threshold
crossing, it resulted in a signal that had the shape of the early phase of
the RP (Schurger et al., 2012). To further test their hypothesis, the au­
thors conducted a second experiment: the participants were interrupted
at random times with a cue that prompted them to perform the move­
ment as fast as possible. In accordance with their model, the neuronal
random fluctuations were close to the threshold in the trials with the
fastest reaction time, while it was far from the threshold in the other
cases (Schurger et al., 2012). This view has also been supported from
animal experiments (Murakami et al., 2014). The main difference with
the classic interpretation is that the RP represents a stochastic process
leading to the decision to move, rather than the result of the decision
(Schurger et al., 2021). Crucially, the RP onset, classically seen at the
beginning of the movement preparation following an unconscious de­
cision to move, could be a mere averaging artifact with no physiological
meaning. In addition, this model predicts that the relevant neuronal
event regarding the decision to move, namely the threshold crossing,
coincides with the timing of conscious intention, as confirmed in
another study using a perceptual decision-making task (Kang et al.,
2017). In other words, the timing of conscious intention (W) is not the
time when we become aware of a decision made unconsciously several
hundreds of milliseconds before, but rather the time of the neuronal
decision itself (Brass et al., 2019). Overall, this provides a parsimonious
explanation that is compatible with our intuition of mental causation.
Conscious intentions could be reduced to a neuronal event, the crossing
of a threshold that triggers the decision to move, and the preceding early
RP may simply reflect an artifact resulting from the averaging of the
random fluctuations leading to this decision (Schurger, 2018; Schurger
et al., 2021).
3.4.2.2. Philosophical criticisms
3.4.2.2.1. Mental causation and conceptual limits. Although intuitive,
the idea that conscious intentions can cause actions raises deep con­
ceptual concerns (Nachev and Hacker, 2014). Among the traditional
criteria required to define a causal relation, dependence is of particular
importance. If we assume that conscious intentions can cause actions,
11

C. Delnatte et al.

Neuropsychologia 188 (2023) 108632

we should assume a dependence relation between the two. In particular,
causation as “difference-making” entails that intentions make a differ­
ence to actions, or in other words, that changing the intention changes
the action (List and Menzies, 2009). But conscious intentions are not a
necessary condition for intentional actions, for many intentional be­
haviors are not preceded by conscious intentions. For instance, while
driving, most of our movements are “automatic”, in the sense that they
are not preceded by a conscious intention. Conversely, conscious in­
tentions are not necessarily followed by actions, because free will lies in
the ability to do otherwise. According to this view, free will would
precisely entail a lack of causal relation between intention and action
(Nachev and Hacker, 2014). Indeed, if actions were causally necessi­
tated by prior intentions, we would lack free will because our actions
would be entirely determined by antecedent causes. Free will and
mental causation would thus be incompatible. This conceptual concern
is thought to seriously undermine the data derived from the experiments
addressing this question.
3.4.2.2.2. The nature of W and conscious intentions. The first concern
is related to the nature of the event that Libet’s experiment measures. W
is supposed to reflect the time of conscious intention. However,
conscious intentions are a mental state (or internal state), meaning that
there are no objective or external elements that allow experimenters to
determine the precise timing of this event (Lee et al., 2022). Rather, we
have to rely on the participant’s subjective report. In addition, the fact
that intentions lack phenomenological properties, as proposed by some
authors, would make it very difficult to establish their precise timing,
and thus to identify the underlying brain events (Nachev and Hacker,
2014).
The second issue is related to the very concept and definition of
“conscious intention”. Conscious intention can be understood in many
different ways (Chalmers, 1996; Roskies, 2011), which is a source of
confusion. It can mean that there is something it is like to form the
intention, that the intention has a “phenomenal feel”. However this
notion has been criticized, arguing that most experiences, in particular
intentions, are deprived of qualitative feel (Hacker, 2012; Nachev and
Hacker, 2014). An alternative definition can be borrowed from the field
of perceptual experience: “access consciousness”. Access consciousness
refers to immediate availability for cognitive process, meaning that
perceptual information is broadcast to a global workspace (Block, 2005,
2022). From this prospect, conscious perception are considered as an
evidence-accumulation process (Pereira et al., 2022). Different percep­
tions are competing to access consciousness. This competition is arbi­
trated by an evidence-accumulation process, where the strongest
perceptual representation accesses consciousness once a threshold of
evidence is crossed (Block, 2005; Pereira et al., 2022). Whether this
concept can be extended to intentions remains an open question. It
seems this view would fit partially with the results from Matsuhashi and
Hallett (Matsuhashi and Hallett, 2008). To avoid retrospective report­
ing, a random auditory cue instantaneously probed the subjects’ in­
tentions at different times (instant T). Instant T occurred much earlier
than W, a lag that might reflect a period of “probe awareness” (Hallett,
2007; Matsuhashi and Hallett, 2008) when the intention is available for
reporting, but has not yet reached access consciousness. However, this
conceptual distinction between two kinds of conscious intention is
speculative and has not been formally demonstrated (Baars and Laureys,
2005; Cleeremans and Tallon-Baudry, 2022). The nature of conscious­
ness remains elusive, and accordingly there is a large number of
diverging definitions, each of them stressing a particular function of
consciousness (Block, 2005; Chalmers, 1996). A conceptual work is
needed to disentangle these different definitions and to point out which
one is relevant for the debate about free will in order to avoid ill-posed
problems (Hacker, 2012).
3.4.2.2.3. Generalizability of the results. The third criticism concerns
the generalizability of the findings obtained with Libet’s task or other
artificial manipulation (Brass et al., 2019; Mele, 2009; Roskies, 2011).
First, there is a conceptual issue concerning the experiments

comparing internally-generated and externally-triggered movements
(Nachev, 2010; Nachev and Husain, 2010). It is classically assumed that
comparison of the two conditions reveals the neurophysiological sub­
strates of voluntary actions. However, an important and as yet unvali­
dated assumption is that the two conditions are comparable. Consider
the example of a choice between a right-hand and a left-hand movement
that is externally-triggered (a visual cue indicates which hand to move)
or internally-generated (the cue indicates that the subject can freely
choose between the two hands). In the externally triggered condition,
the nature and number of factors that influence the outcome is precisely
controlled (a left arrow will be associated with a left-hand movement,
and vice versa). By contrast, in the free choice condition, the nature and
number of internal factors that will lead to the decision is completely
unknown. When performing a succession of choices in the absence of
any external evidence to determine the answer, the participants may
rely on the accumulation of contextual evidence, like the history of past
choices, in an attempt to produce a pseudo-randomized behavior (Bode
et al., 2014; Nachev, 2010). Importantly, while this kind of information
is usually not consciously monitored by the subjects, it can substantially
influence the choices made by the participants (Bode et al., 2014). The
accuracy of the algorithm proposed by Soon and colleagues to predict
the choice of participants as early as 8 s before they acted (Soon et al.,
2008) is in fact similar to the accuracy of predictions that are based on
the sequence of preceding responses (Lages and Jaworska, 2012). In this
study, the subjects selected for the analysis produced
pseudo-randomized behaviors (Soon et al., 2008). Rather than decoding
the subsequent choice of the subjects, the fMRI patterns detected by this
algorithm reflect the bias in the history of past choices that will influence
the next one (Bode et al., 2014; Brass et al., 2019; Nachev, 2010). It has
thus been argued that the contrast between the two conditions (inter­
nally-generated and externally-cued) may not reflect the neuronal net­
works underlying voluntary actions. Instead, it could be caused by a
difference in the number and nature of factors that determine the action
(Nachev, 2010; Nachev and Husain, 2010). This conceptual objection
cannot be tested with the existing experimental setups, and seriously
undermines the results obtained in these studies.
Second, the degree of freedom (the number of possibilities) proposed
in these tasks are limited. In Libet’s study, the participants had to choose
when to perform a movement, but the movement was pre-determined.
In addition, the timing of the movement, supposedly free, had some
constraints, for instance regarding the interval between two movements.
In the tasks exploring the “what” component of intentional actions, the
choice was limited to deciding between right- or left-hand movements.
Third, it is misleading to assume that an internally-generated
movement is necessarily more voluntary than an externally-cued ac­
tion. Some movements can occur in the absence of a clear external
trigger, such as yawning or blinking, and it is difficult to say that they
reflect free will. Conversely, the first movements of an improvisation
dancer that are triggered by the first notes of a piece of music would
probably be considered as free.
Fourth, the mere fact that a participant agrees to comply with an
experimenter’s demands in the first place, implies that the movements
they perform in Libet’s task are not free (Mele, 2009; Pockett et al.,
2009; Roskies, 2011). A participant may form conscious intentions
about how to perform the task at the beginning of the experiment, which
may limit the “freedom” of the individual movements performed during
the task. It has been suggested that subjects enter a state of “prepared­
ness” during each trial to introspectively monitor their intentions, and
that the detection of an internal signal determined at the beginning of
the experiment could trigger the movement. Thus, there would be two
kinds of intentions at stake (Brass et al., 2019; Mele, 2009, 2014;
Mylopoulos and Pacherie, 2019): a distal conscious intention formed at
the beginning of the task, concerning the determination of the internal
signal to monitor; and a proximal intention resulting from the detection
of such a signal formed before the execution of each movement. In
Libet’s tasks, the proximal intentions are the focus of investigation:
12

C. Delnatte et al.

Neuropsychologia 188 (2023) 108632

whether or not they are indeed unconsciously initiated does not affect
our conception of free will, it is rather the formation of distal intentions
that is relevant (Brass et al., 2019; Mele, 2009). We cannot generalize
from these results that distal intentions are also initiated unconsciously.
Last and most importantly, the nature of the actions that are studied
in such experimental setups may not be fully relevant for the free will
debate. The proposed movements are both meaningless and arbitrary. In
philosophy, these situations are usually referred to as “liberty of indif­
ference”. Rather, we would expect to exert our free will when confronted
with a situation where the different alternatives have significant con­
sequences. When we have equally powerful reasons to choose between
two sets of an alternative, we are torn between the different possibilities.
It is only when facing a “torn decision” that our choices are meaningful,
i.e., we are exercising our free will (Kane, 1998). The substantial dif­
ference between these two situations can be subsumed under the
distinction between “picking” and “choosing” (Brass et al., 2019; Ull­
mann-Margalit and Morgenbesser, 1977). To take an example from
Adina Roskies, when putting on your pants, which leg you put in first is a
matter of “picking”, not “choosing”. Whether you put the right or left leg
in first makes absolutely no difference, and it would not be surprising
that such an action unfolds unconsciously. The argument here is that the
movements performed in Libet’s task, and in most of the tasks used in
neuroscience, are similar to “picking” which leg to start with when you
get dressed. Most of us would accept that such an event unfolds un­
consciously, but only a few would take this as evidence that all of our
movements and actions are unconsciously initiated in a similar manner,
and thus that we lack free will (Roskies, 2011).
To summarize, even if Libet’s results were considered as correct and
reproducible, meaning that the movements investigated in this task are
initiated unconsciously, it does not necessarily affect our conception of
free will. Indeed, we cannot speculate from these findings that other
types of actions and decisions, in particular the ones that are relevant for
free will, are similarly initiated unconsciously.
At this point, an important objection can be raised. As noted earlier,
the neuronal mechanisms underlying complex and arbitrary decisions
are probably the same. We described how an accumulation-to-bound
model could account for these different kinds of decision-making
(Bode et al., 2014; Brass et al., 2019; Murakami et al., 2014; Roskies,
2010; Schurger et al., 2016). Even though the situations studied in
laboratories are limited and simplistic, they should still be able to cap­
ture the important features of free will (Haggard, 2008). However, as
stressed previously, it would seem that a crucial difference between the
two situations lies in the nature of the evidence that is accumulated to
reach the response threshold. We saw that in the “free-choice” para­
digms, the absence of external evidence results in an accumulation of
stochastic neuronal noise. By contrast, in real-life situations, our de­
cisions are based on reasons that matter to us. A recent study confirms
this idea (Maoz et al., 2019). In this task, the participants had to choose
to donate their money to one of two non-profit organizations with two
different kinds of decision: arbitrary and deliberate. For the arbitrary
decision, the same amount of money was allocated to the two organi­
zations irrespective of the participant’s choice. For the deliberate deci­
sion, the participant’s choice determined which of the two organizations
received the money. Importantly, in both arbitrary and deliberate de­
cisions, the choice involved a similar movement as the participants had
to indicate their response by pressing a button with the left or right
hand. Interestingly, an RP was identified for arbitrary decisions, but not
for deliberate decisions. The authors concluded that the RP is an artifact
resulting from the accumulation of random neuronal noise (Schurger
et al., 2012), explaining why it is observed specifically in arbitrary de­
cisions, but not in deliberate decisions (Maoz et al., 2019). In keeping
with these results, two other studies suggested that the neural substrates
of deliberate and arbitrary decisions differ (Bold et al., 2022; Khalighi­
nejad et al., 2019; Travers et al., 2021). By contrast, other studies failed
to find any difference in the RP between arbitrary and deliberate de­
cisions (Bold et al., 2022; Parés-Pujolràs et al., 2021; Travers and

Haggard, 2021; Verbaarschot et al., 2019). Although there is no defin­
itive consensus regarding this issue, the results strongly undermine the
generalization of Libet’s results. Indeed, the RP might be a brain signal
that is specific to arbitrary decisions, but that would be absent in the
real-life situations that are relevant for free will.
3.4.3. Toward a reconciliation of mental causation and experimental data
The way Libet presented his hypothesis played an important role in
the apparent incompatibility between neuroscience results and mental
causation. Libet and others considered only two possible outcomes of the
experiment (Haggard and Libet, 2001) (Fig. 4). On one hand, according
to their physicalist view, conscious intentions follow the beginning of
the RP, and thus conscious free will cannot exist (Fig. 4A). On the other
hand, they argued that the only alternative is substance dualism: mental
causation would be possible only if a conscious intention was shown to
precede the RP onset (Fig. 4B). In consequence, the authors considered
only two possible temporal sequences: either the RP precedes conscious
intentions, or conscious intentions precede the RP.
Mental causation and physicalism are thus presented as two incom­
patible positions. For Libet and others, physicalism implies that mental
states are caused by brain activity, while mental causation entails that
mental states cause brain activity, a position they present as dualistic.
The opposition they draw between mental causation and physicalism
comes down to the opposition between dualism and physicalism.
However, most contemporary scientists and philosophers would dismiss
substance dualism. In addition, different philosophical positions that
accept physicalism defend the possibility that mental events are not only
the consequence of brain activity, but also the cause of physical events.
In particular, reductive physicalism considers that mental events can
have physical consequences precisely in virtue of the reducibility of
mental events to physical events. So, philosophically, mental causation
does not preclude physicalism.
Another possibility that was not considered by Libet is that conscious
intentions coincide with the brain signal that causes a movement
(Fig. 4C). This assumption would be compatible with physicalism:
because mental states supervene on physical states, a mental state
cannot precede brain activity, but they can be simultaneous. Crucially, it
would also be compatible with the possibility that a conscious intention
can cause an action. If conscious intentions are reducible to the neuronal
decision to move, in virtue of this reducibility, the causal powers of
conscious intentions are identical to those of the underlying brain ac­
tivity. Thus, conscious intentions could be considered as the cause of
movement initiation (Block, 2022; Gavenas et al., 2022). This would
reconcile our intuitive notions of free will with the physicalism that
many neuroscientists advocate for. We previously saw that recent
empirical data and theoretical models support this view by suggesting
that W actually corresponds to the moment of the neural decision to
move (Brass et al., 2019; Schurger, 2018; Schurger et al., 2021)
(Fig. 4C).
Still, the precise neuronal underpinnings of conscious intention need
to be investigated (Hopkins et al., 2022), as well as their contribution to
action generation (Gavenas et al., 2022; Seth and Bayne, 2022). The
respective role of the parietal and prefrontal regions in the generation of
conscious intention remains elusive (Desmurget et al., 2009; Desmurget
and Sirigu, 2012; Fried et al., 1991). It has been proposed that conscious
intention is formed in the posterior parietal cortex, and that the
consciously selected response is then planned in the precentral regions
(including the SMA and preSMA), before being transmitted to the pri­
mary motor cortex (Desmurget and Sirigu, 2012). This view is supported
by empirical findings showing an increased connectivity between the
parietal and prefrontal regions during voluntary movements (Doganci
et al., 2023; Pesaran et al., 2008). Although the precise mechanisms
underlying the causal role of conscious intentions in action generation
are not completely understood, the theoretical framework we propose
allows this possibility.

Following the seminal study of Benjamin Libet, many neuroscientists
concluded that conscious intention is deprived of any causal power
regarding the initiation of our movements. However, these studies suffer
from both technical and philosophical limitations. Importantly, we think
it is inappropriate to generalize results obtained with experimental
paradigms that may not be fully relevant for investigating free will. In
addition, recent data suggest that in Libet’s task conscious intention is in
fact simultaneous with the neuronal event reflecting the decision,
reconciling neuroscience with our intuition that intention can cause
action. Thus, there is a need to develop new experimental setups that can
measure brain signals related to volition in a more ecological context,
reflecting situations with meaningful alternatives and consequences.
Overall, neuroscience may not hold the answer to the longstanding
philosophical questions about free will. Nevertheless, neuroscientific
input should be considered as important and useful to unravel some of
the physical properties of functional brain networks at play when free
will is exerted. Neuroscientists and philosophers should foster collabo­
rative and interdisciplinary work and share theoretical and practical
experimental knowledge to improve our common understanding of free
will. More practically, by further unraveling the brain processes un­
derlying various aspects of free will, neuroscience could enlighten the
legal notion of responsibility in the future (Bigenwald and Chambon,
2019; Roskies et al., 2013).

3.4.4. New experimental paradigms and conceptual limits
The many criticisms we have reviewed necessitate the development
of new experimental paradigms to study free will and mental causation.
We have already mentioned the study from Maoz et al. which provides a
relevant and powerful framework to explore this question (Maoz et al.,
2019). Briefly, the participant had to choose to donate money to one of
two real non-profit organizations out of a panel of 50. In order to provide
an ecological context, real organizations were proposed to the partici­
pants, some of which were consensual, and some of which were not.
Before the task, the participants were asked to rate the organizations
according to their personal preferences. In the deliberate trials, the
participant’s response resulted in a real donation to the organization
they chose, so that their decisions where both meaningful and conse­
quential. Some of the choices were made harder by presenting two or­
ganizations for which the participant had a similar preference, in order
to reproduce the difficulty of the decisions encountered in real life.
Based on this framework, digital immersive environment technologies
could provide a computer-based, three-dimensional world, that would
allow the experimenter to test complex and realistic decision-making
situations (Aharoni et al., 2008).
Still, these situations do not represent the dilemma we face in real
life. It is nothing like a “torn decision”, where we truly have equally
good reasons to choose one option over another (Kane, 1998). For
ethical reasons, the consequential decisions that are philosophically
relevant for free will cannot be reproduced in a laboratory for the pur­
pose of an experiment. An alternative would be to follow the brain ac­
tivity of participants in their daily activities with portable devices such
as wireless EEG (Barbey et al., 2022; Niso et al., 2023) or portable
magnetoencephalography (Boto et al., 2018). With this approach it
would be technically possible to investigate mental causation in real-life
situations.
These recent advances in technology are promising. However, there
are important conceptual limits that go beyond experimental consider­
ations, and which require a true dialogue between neuroscience and
philosophy. As outlined before, a conscious intention can be understood
in different ways. Philosophers could provide a conceptual clarification
regarding which kind of “conscious intention” is relevant when
considering mental causation. In the same way, philosophers could
enlighten neuroscientists about the different meanings and concepts of
causation. What do we mean when we say that intentions cause actions?
What kind of dependence relation do we implicitly assume? Philoso­
phers have extensively studied these questions, and neuroscientists
should take advantage of this work to produce robust hypotheses that
can be properly tested.

4. Conclusion
Free will has been the subject of debate in philosophy for centuries.
For a few decades now, neuroscience has also taken a position and
claims to bring important insights regarding two elements that are
central to the notion of free will: determinism and mental causation. We
highlight the advances that have allowed a better understanding of the
brain mechanisms underlying decision-making. Although tremendous
progress has been made, there is as yet no definitive answer as to
whether the brain processes producing our free choices are deterministic
or indeterministic. However, reducing the argument to free choice being
determinitic or indeterministic presents at least two limitations. First,
both possibilities can be considered equally problematic. Determinism is
clearly incompatible with at least some forms of free will. However,
indeterminism in the form of randomness is also an issue, as it is not
synonymous of freedom. Second, because of epistemic limitations,
neuroscience might never provide the answer to this question. In the
second part, we reviewed the results concerning the causal role of our
conscious intentions. The most important challenge came from the
observation that conscious intentions seem to follow, rather than to
precede, the RP, the brain signal that is thought to cause action.

The formalism of asymptotic duality structure with applications to late time asymptotic states of linear
and nonlinear systems is presented. A scale invariant linear differential system is shown to admit higher
derivative discontinuous, nonsmooth solutions under the action of asymptotic duality transformations.
The relevant asymptotic quantities are self dual and ﬁnitely differentiable. The geometrical meaning and
applications to higher order nonlinear systems are presented on the space of differentiable functions. A
novel duality relationship between linear and nonlinear systems is exposed. A linear system is shown
to extend self similarly over nonlinear, classically inaccessible scales thereby extending classical smooth
solution space to a nonsmooth one. A nonlinear system, on the other hand, is shown to proliferate into
a system of self similar linear equations that could be solved exactly to have a very eﬃcient high precision computation of periodic orbits. An extension of self dual asymptotics to critically self dual case
in the space of continuous functions reveals a connection to prime number theorem and the associated
correction term respecting the Riemann hypothesis.

1. Introduction
Classical mechanics is deterministic, when sensitive dependence
on initial conditions and associated unpredictability of a nonlinear
chaotic system arise from the empirical limitations in determining
an initial condition with unlimited or inﬁnite accuracy. Classical indeterminacy therefore is of epistemological in nature and can not
be considered to be an ontological principle. True randomness and
indeterminism in physics is supposed to arise only at the quantum
mechanical level. Here, we present some interesting, signiﬁcantly
new results in classical mechanics and analysis that have the potential to put the well known facts of classical mechanics in an
entirely new light. Based on the novel concept of asymptotic duality [1–3], we have uncovered a sort of dual relationship between
a class of linear systems and a nonlinear system and vice versa.
Asymptotic duality is a set of nonlinear transformations (viz, localized scaling and inversion) that awards every asymptotic variable of the form t → 0 (or t → ∞) (i.e. Cauchy null (divergent) sequences) two conjugate asymptotic variables T± (t ) respecting a local inversion law T− (t )/t ∝ t /T+ (t ) and associated ﬁnite, renormalized scaling exponents v± (t ). We present here the general framework to work with such duality structures that could be accessed

at an asymptotic time in an analysis of a dynamical system. We
give a review of a previous applications [5,6] of a cascade of local
scaling and inversions (asymptotic duality transformations) uncovering a nontrivial class of nonsmooth (higher derivative discontinuous) solutions of a scale invariant linear (ﬁrst order) differential
system. The linear system thus gets proliferated self similarly over
cascades of nonlinear scales those remain inaccessible in the absence of duality transformations. Moreover, exact determinism in
a classical linear system is lost because of nontrivial presence of
a countable set of smaller scale scaling parameters that are generally not fully determinate in the construction. The loss of higher
derivatives, viz, the second derivative, for instance, is then shown
to offer a nontrivial existence for the above duality structure. The
duality structure realized in the context of linear differentiable systems turns out, generally, to be of self dual type, so that the corresponding self dual, (ﬁnite) renormalized scaling exponents v± (t )
(v+ (t ) = v− (t )) happen to be only ﬁrst order continuously differentiable.
We present a general framework, that inherits features of Nonstandard Analysis (NSA) [8,9], Intuitionist Mathematics [10] and
the theory of Fermat’s real [11], to interpret such exact constructions yielding a higher order nonsmooth behaviour and associated
loss of determinism. We next extend this asymptotic duality constructions to a second order system that reveals a rather unex-

pected dual relationship of a nonlinear system with a class of linear systems. Exploiting asymptotic duality, extended over an appropriate function space, we demonstrate that a nonlinear system
could be mapped self similarly to a family of linear systems that
exists nontrivially over smaller nonlinear scales. Such proliferated
linear systems could be solved exactly to formulate very high precision nonperturbative computation schemes for nonlinear systems
[12]. We ﬁnally present an application of a special class of non-self
dual asymptotics, the critically self dual asymptotics, in the context of analytic number theory. The critical self dual asymtotics are
shown to offer a realization of the prime number theorem (PNT)
[13]. The associate correction term satisfying a criticality limit is
also shown to produce the tightest error bound respecting the Riemann hypothesis. The true implications of this observation is left
for future investigations.
To connect and compare above results with those in current literature, we notice that in a series of recent papers, Nicolas Gisin
[14–16] brings out an interesting relationship between the concept of time and indeterminism in physics based on Intuitionistic logic [10] and Real Number system in mathematics. It is suggested that the randomness in classical physics as evidenced in
chaotic structures in nonlinear dynamics may not be simply epistemic, but could be realized on an equivalent ontological setting, as
is usually considered in quantum uncertainties, provided the conventional parametric role of time variable is replaced by a truly dynamical ‘time’ of intuitionistic mathematics [10]. In the intuitionistic interpretation of real number system, the real number continuum is composed of “free choice sequences”, as the creator of intuitionistic approach of mathematics, L.E.J. Brouwer [17], called it.
Intuitionistic real numbers are not ‘numbers’ in the precise sense
of classical mathematics, these are actually realized as dynamical
processes evolving in time and, at any instant of time, any given
real number is only known as a ﬁnitary object represented by, at
the most, a ﬁnite number of well determined decimal digits, when
the remaining inﬁnity of decimals are indeterminate, in the form
of choice sequences.
In classical mathematics, on the contrary, real numbers are inﬁnitary quantities, determined by inﬁnite lists of well determined
decimal digits, deﬁned and given all at a time as completed objects. In other words, conventional real numbers are, in principle
(ontologically), completely determinable objects, although deﬁnition requires inﬁnitary objects, such as sequences, sets and etc.
Chaos and randomness in classical nonlinear dynamics is more of
an epistemic reason, arising basically from operational limitations
on exact determination of real numbers. On the contrary, Intuitionistic numbers are not only genuinely dynamical but also intrinsically random and fundamentally indeterminate, because choice sequences are, by deﬁnition, so. Choice sequences, by deﬁnition, are
sequences of indeterminate “bits”, except for an initial segment
of ﬁnite number of bits which are true decimal digits (0 or 1, in
binary representation). Beyond such initial ﬁnite (n, say) number
of well determinate bits, remaining inﬁnity of bits are dynamically evolving stochastic quantities, until the precise determination
of the next (n + 1 )th bit is empirically achieved at the (n + 1 )th
time instant, for instance, leaving out, however, the next successive bits indeterminate. Consequently, as advocated in detail by
Gisin [14–16], if the physical time is interpreted as an intuitionist variable assuming values from intuitionist continuum then time
would automatically be ﬂowing, with an intrinsic sense of arrow,
in contrast to the current usages, in vogue in literature, of parametric time variable, without any sense of ﬂow or passage. Moreover, with such a novel re-interpretation of physical time, classical mechanics, as argued by the author, can not be deterministic,
but would become ontologically indeterministic and random, analogous to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, above proposals of Intuitionistic concepts in classical mechan-

ics were intended mainly at the level of interpretation only [14], no
new physics was predicted.
Quite independent of this proposal, the present author have
been advocating over sometime analogous views and interpretations of standard classical mechanical results based on higher order nonsmooth solutions of scale invariant differential equations
and associate asymptotic duality. It has been argued that such nonclassical behaviour and associated loss of determinism in classical systems could be interpreted and realized in the framework
of intelligent living systems [5], that should enjoy special quality of independent decision making mechanisms in a feedback
(linear/nonlinear) loop and could break out from classical phase
space paths to nonclassical evolutionary patterns. As pointed out
by Posy [10] and Gisin [14,16] for an intuitive and indeterminate
system, future is open and new possibilities could be experienced
based on speciﬁc unfolding of choice based sequences. Here, we argue that such nonclassical indeterministic interpretations is symptomatic not only of intuitionist mathematics but could be realized in the present extended classical mathematics setting as well.
Stated alternatively, classical mechanics (mathematics) extended
with asymptotic duality structures is shown to inherit not only
intuitionist mathematical ﬂavours but also enjoy very rich novel
nonlinear properties such as self similar proliferation of dynamical systems and new evolutionary prospects. Further, existence of a
system of self similar linear equations corresponding to the higher
order corrections to the zeroth level approximate periodic orbit to
a nonlinear oscillatory problem could be utilized to develop a very
eﬃcient non-perturbative computation scheme for the exact periodic orbit [4,7,12].
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 and 2.1, we present
some basic notions and results of Nonstandard analysis [8,9] and
Intuitionist mathematics [10,14]. A short review of Fermat’s real
[11] is presented and notations of nilpotent quantities and nilpotent polynomials introduced. Sec. 2.2, presents notions of asymptotic duality and associated deﬁnitions. Sec. 2.3 contains some remarks towards interpreting asymptotic duality structures as constructions involving Fermat inﬁnitesimals. Sec. 3 reviews with a
number of news results, the construction of higher derivative
discontinuous solutions of a ﬁrst order scale invariant equation.
The details of construction is presented in Sec. 3.1. Sec. 3.2 and
3.3, present geometrical meaning of the nonsmooth solutions and
some other important properties. In Sec. 3.4, we study extension
to more general solution space involving 3rd and higher odd order
nonsmooth solutions. Finally, in Sec. 3.5, relationship of nonsmooth
solutions and asymptotic duality is studied. The self dual deformation scaling exponents are interpreted in terms of nonsmooth solutions. In Sec. 4, we interpret these results in the context of living
intelligent systems in the extended framework of Fermat reals accommodating ﬂavours of both nonstandard analysis and intuitionist mathematics. Sec. 5 presents extensions of the asymptotic duality and construction of nonsmooth solutions in a general function
space. First we develop formalism on C r (R, R ), the space of continuously rth order differentiable functions. Self similar extensions
of a function f ∈ C r is formulated; the relevant correction factor
is shown to satisfy universally a scale invariant ﬁrst order linear
system involving nonlinear scales living in the function space. The
nonsmooth solution space of a linear ODE is next constructed. In
Sec. 5.2, the problem of a possible late time bifurcation of an initial linear system into a nonlinear system is demonstrated under a
special choice of scaling parameters inhabiting the function space.
In Sec. 5.3, we show that a nonlinear oscillatory problem could be
mapped to self similar system of linear ODEs over nonlinear scales,
that could be solved exactly to yield a highly eﬃcient nonperturbative computation of periodic orbits of the original problem. Finally,
in Sec. 5.4, we present an extension of asymptotic duality in the
space of continuous functions. The Prime Number Theorem (PNT)

and associated correction term [13] are determined universally by
critically self dual asymptotics. We conclude in Sec. 6 with some
remarks on future scope of this study. Finally, in Appendix A and
Appendix B, we collect proofs of some results (Lemmas) which are
used in the main body of the paper.

axiom of choice and is consistent with the classical ZFC (Zermelo
Fraenkel with Choice) set theory. The existence of inﬁnitely small
and large numbers are ascertained by the choice of an ultraﬁlter,
when the transfer principle allows one to carry forward the order
and analytic structures of real continuum over a subclass of the
new extended continuum of inﬁnitely small and large numbers
qualiﬁed as ‘internal’ [9]. In other words, such inﬁnitely small and
large ideal numbers, by construction, modulo the choice of a ultraﬁlter, do inherit most of the basic properties of real numbers,
for instance, order relation, algebraic properties and etc. However,
there are important differences as well: ﬁnite real numbers and
those of inﬁnitely small (or large), actually belong to two distinct
classes separated by gaps, ﬁnite and inﬁnitude objects can not be
mutually mapped one into other and back [9].
Brouwer’s intuitionist real continuum, on the other hand, need
not be strictly ZFC consistent, since it rejects not only the law of
excluded middle but also can not accommodate the inﬁnitary structure of the stronger form of axiom of choice [10]. Instead, formal
foundation of intuitionist mathematics was realized on the basis
of a weaker constructive intuitionist form of ZF set theory along
with a weaker version of choice, viz, countable axiom of choice
[18]. Further, because of the absence of the law of excluded middle, intuitionist mathematicians succeeded in constructing inﬁnitely
small evanescent quantities based on speciﬁc choice sequences respecting the so called ﬂeeing properties [10,20]. Brouwer’s original
conception [17] of arbitrarily small evanescent quantities, though
constructed explicitly by Vesley in 1981[20], may perhaps be considered historically as the ﬁrst original conceptualization/ realization of rigorous examples of inﬁnitesimals that could be put into
a sound intuitionistic logical setting. Such inﬁnitesimals are, however, not invertible, since intuitionist continuum is, generally, not a
ﬁeld, but only a ring [10].
Non-invertible nilsquare or higher order nilpotent inﬁnitesimals are formulated consistently in the framework of smooth inﬁnitesimal analysis (SIA) [21] and synthetic differential geometry
(SDG)later [22]. Let us recall that a quantity  is nilpotent of order k if ||k = 0 but ||i  = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , k − 1. When k = 2,  is
a nilsquare object. In classical mathematics (logic) ||2 = 0 means
 = 0, by the law of excluded middle. Nontrivial existence of such
objects are, however, allowed in Intuitionist logic as a weaker connective of double negation, so that ¬¬∃d ∈ D, ⇒ d ∈ D = { ∈
R| 2 = 0}, D being the neighbourhood of nilsquare (ﬁrst order) iniﬁnitesimals [22]. In virtue of these nilpotent inﬁnitesimals, limits
in smooth inﬁnitesimal analysis is replaced by algebraic structures
of nilpotent inﬁnitesimals [21,22].
Recently, a class of intuitionist continuum models are also created involving invertible as well as non-invertible inﬁnitesimals,
making closer contact with classical nonstandard models [19].
Giordano [11], on the other hand, formulated the theory of Fermat reals involving nilpotent inﬁnitesimals rigorously in classical
mathematics. The formalism seems to be an appropriate framework for interpreting the novel results presented in this paper.
These inﬁnitesimals are concretely realizable as equivalence classes
of little-oh polynomials [11]. The Fermat reals is a model of nonstandard analysis [9] that admits both non-invertible and a class
of invertible inﬁnitesimals. Let us recall that any statement or formula is veriﬁable and indeed veriﬁed in a nonstandard model R∗ if
and only if the formula is veriﬁed for a single representative r ∈ R
of the corresponding equivalence class r∗ := [r] ∈ R∗ [9,11]. In [11],
the extension of Fermat real R∗ is realized as R∗ ≡ R0 [t]/ ∼, where
R0 [t] is the ring of little-oh polynomials, and two such polynomials
x(t ), y(t ) are equivalent x ∼ y provided | x−y
t | = o(1 ), o(1 ) being a
null sequence, as t → 0. A real valued function x : R+ → R is called
nilpotent iff |x(t ) − x(0 )|k = o(t ), t → 0+ for some positive integer
k. A little-oh (nilpotent) polynomial therefore has the general form

x = r + k1 αi · t ai + o(t ), t → 0+ where r, αi  = 0 ∈ R, ai ∈ R+ . As

2. Fat real continuum and fractal time
In classical mathematics, real continuum is deﬁned by convergent Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. The deﬁnition is inﬁnitary because it involves manifolds (actually four fold) of equivalent
classes of inﬁnite sequences and sets [10]. Moreover, it is skinny
and brittle because it allows cuts into two distinct (disconnected)
parts, by simply removing a point from the one dimensional line.
Intuitionist real number set, on the other hand, is viscous in nature, in the sense that this continuum can no longer be cut into
two separate parts by isolating a point from it, as the point tend
to remain sticky with the continuum. The real numbers are here
realized as equivalent classes of choice sequences, each having only
an initial ﬁnite part to be fully determined integral digits (or rationals), when remaining inﬁnity of terms remain mostly indeterminate and awaiting to be determined successively as time ﬂows
on to future moments. Consequently, intuitionist continuum is dynamical in nature, as its very deﬁnition involves a sense of ﬂowing time, in contrast to the static classical counterpart. Intuitionist
mathematical objects are also ﬁnitary, because realization of such
objects are supposed to require only ﬁnite information [10,14]. As
emphasized by Gisin, intuitionist continuum seems to offer significant insights into a more realistic modeling of the physical time
sense in classical physics [14–16].
Independent of these developments we have been formulating
an idea of dynamical time that should reﬂect more realistically the
dynamical (ﬂowing) nature of physical time sense, based on the
novel concepts such as relative inﬁnitesimals, asymptotic duality and
higher derivative discontinuity and that of dynamic number system
[1,2,5,6]. Here, we review the formalism with further clariﬁcations
and also present some new results. Next, we compare these ideas
and results with intuitionist approach and argue that the present
framework could be interpreted as a robust one, bringing in closure contacts of classical Platonist view with that of intuitionist
ﬁnitude. More speciﬁcally, physical time sense and the concept of
continuum is neither fully classical nor intuitionistic, but should,
in a sense, be realized as a concatenation of both the structures,
when classical inﬁnitary structure is interpreted as ‘ﬁnitely’ realizable object and the nonstandard inﬁnite (transﬁnite) structure
is interpreted as intuitionistic randomness and choice. But, before
delving into this, let us make a few important remarks on the role
of inﬁnitely small and large quantities in classical mathematics, as
well as in intuitionist world.
2.1. Inﬁnitely small and large: classical vis á vis intuitionistic
Although the concept of inﬁnitesimally small quantities was
freely used by Newton and Liebnitz in their original formulations
of calculus, the concept was later rejected by working mathematicians after rigorous formalization of analysis by Weierstrass
and Cauchy. However, the concept remain intuitively appealing to
physics community mainly because of its ease in handling the
limiting problems and other dynamical applications. In 1960s, A.
Robinson [8] succeeded in a rigorous formulation of nonstandard
models of real number continuum involving inﬁnitely small and
large quantities. By deﬁnition, an inﬁnitesimally small (positive)
real quantity q is one that is less than any positive real number r,
0 < q < r, ∀ real r > 0. Since nonstandard real continuum is a ﬁeld,
inﬁnitely large numbers are then realized as q−1 . The nonstandard
model of continuum is constructed using model theory along with

can not improve the situation in a signiﬁcant way, not to mention
the enhanced complexity in undertaking such computations.
To eliminate such limitations in conventional approaches, we
propose the following constructions [1,2,7]:
In the context of a nonlinear system the conventional linear
ﬂow of time as designated above by the scales of the form ε −n
has the potential to carry slowly varying nonlinear structures given
by a renormalized, deformed scale of the form t ∼ ε −n · ψ (ε −n , η ),
where the deformation factor is assumed to share some special
properties. To explain it more precisely and to see what is happening, let us proceed in steps, introducing certain deﬁnitions and
some basic results those will be relevant for applications presented
in this paper:
Step 1: To introduce new asymptotic structures, let us begin by
considering the set of real null and divergent (either to ∞ or −∞)
sequences, denoted N , while t is a representative divergent (t −1
null) sequence. In conventional treatments, Cauchy null and divergent sequences are considered separately. The present approach
thus deviates from classical approaches right at the beginning.
Step 2: Deﬁnitions [1,2]
(a) Let us assume that the dominant characteristic scale of the
typical nonlinear system is ε and also satisﬁes, for deﬁniteness,
ε < 1. This scale, in turn, deﬁnes a null sequence ε n (or a divergent
sequence ε −n ), called the primary scale, in the subsequent analysis.
Relative to this scale, the asymptotic variable t → ∞, in the context of the chosen nonlinear problem, is assumed to get deformed
images of the form

with an extra nontrivial constraint on the indices ai viz, 0 <
a1 < a2 . . . < ak ≤ 1. Consequently, an approximate equality upto a
Little-oh function o(t ) in R is extended as an exact equality in R∗ .
Further, a genuine inﬁnitesimal in R∗ must be non-differentiable at
t = 0 as it is evident from (1) with r = 0 and 0 < ai < 1. As a consequence, the equivalent class of differentiable functions is trivial
and identiﬁed with 0.
In the following, we outline a new approach in realizing inﬁnitesimals and inﬁnitely large quantities in a dynamical setting that would admit an interesting intuitionistic interpretation,
though realized originally from the conventional classical setting,
thereby giving a model of concatenation, alluded to above. In fact,
the dynamically realized inﬁnitesimals could be interpreted (c.f.
Proposition 3.2) as members of R∗ , the ring of Fermat real, that
extends an usual nonstandard extension R∗ , viz, R∗ ⊇ R∗ ⊇ R.
2.2. Asymptotic duality
Given a nonlinear dynamical system, one may invoke, with advantage, the principle of asymptotic duality structure [1–3] supported by an extended real analytic framework, incorporating
asymptotic (limiting) SL(2, R ) invariant (viz., translation and inversion invariant) (O(1)) variables, that could vanish much more
slowly compared to the original asymptotic variable t or t −1 , as
the case may be, in either of the limiting neighbourhoods t → 0+
or t → ∞. Assuming the real continuum R as a subset of a nonstandard like extension R∗ , the nontrivial asymptotic quantities introduced below, may be thought of as emerging from the so called
nonstandard domains of R∗ (or R∗ ), with potential dynamical applications. The term nonstandard is used here in a non-pedantic
manner, to indicate rather informally any (either nonstandard analysis (NSA) or smooth inﬁnitesimal analysis (SIA) and/or Fermat’s
real) formal extension of real continuum accommodating a rigorous class of inﬁnitely small and large entities. We remark that,
although we model our formulation in the usual classical mathematical format, extended with a few dynamical ingredients, the
results presented here would also have an intuitionist interpretation. Further, the asymptotic results presented, although motivated
by nonlinear problems, enjoy nontrivial applications even to a linear system, having some interesting nonclassical ramiﬁcations [c.f.
Sec. 3.1].
Let us recall that a salient feature of a nonlinear system is
the existence of a cascade of slow scales τn = ε n t, so that the
variable t goes to ∞ through scales ε −n , ε < 1 (a characteristic scale in the system), thus activating successive subdominant
slower scales τn ∼ O(1 ) in an organized manner, ultimately driving
the system behaviour towards a more complex evolutionary structures at an asymptotic late time. For a strongly nonlinear situation
the relevant scales would, however, be deﬁned as τn = t/ε n , ε >
1. Conventional asymptotic analysis such as reductive perturbative method, multiple scale method [23], renormalization group
method [24] etc. are known to exploit such scales to convert the
naive perturbation series into more effective schemes, capturing
some of the non-perturbative features of the nonlinear dynamics.
However, it is now generally accepted that the above mentioned
asymptotic methods, although are usually successful in capturing
qualitative features of periodic or other orbits, fails, however, to
yield quantitatively eﬃcient results in strongly nonlinear problems,
because of signiﬁcant difference between asymptotically approximate solutions with the exact numerical orbits [3,7,12]. We note
that higher order calculations based on conventional treatments

t± = λ± ε −n σ (ε −n )±v± (η ) ,

σ (ε −n ) = ε −n/ψ0 (ε

satisfying the local inversion rule

t+ · t− = λ(ε −n )2 .

(3)

where equalities are to be interpreted up to o(t −1 ) (Landau littleoh notation) [11] or o(η ) for some suitable small scale variable of
the form η ≈ | log  m t | for a m > 1, where o(1 ) denote null sequences. The local inversions are to be realized as either t− →
−1
−1
t−
∝ t+ or t+ → t+
∝ t− . It may be pointed out that the parameter λ on the right hand side of (3) has the role of a radius in the
standard deﬁnition of inversion of a point relative to a circle in the
plane. Clearly, the above deﬁnition of localized inversion on the
real line could be extended to higher dimensional spaces as well,
that would be considered separately.
The scaling (deformation) exponents v± (η ) > 0 in (2), on the
other hand, are as yet unspeciﬁed real valued functions of the slow
variables ηn = log τn τn = ε n t, that we denote, for brevity, by a general small scale O(1 ) variable η varying in a neighbourhood of 1,
viz, of the form 0 << η < 1 or 1 < η << 2. Such a situation can be
realized in a dynamical problem for suﬃciently large t ∼ eε −n so
that ηn ∼ 1, so as to make the above deﬁnition non-trivial.
Further, the deformation factor σ (ε −n ) for the time variable is
assumed to have the special factored form as above, with σ and
ψ0 depending solely on the primary scale ε −n , so that σ ±v± (η ) resides in the vicinity 1. As a result, the faster scale ε −n may get
dynamically slightly strectched or contracted based on variations
in ψ0 . It should also be clear, from above deﬁnitions of deformed
images, the exponents v± (η ) should also depend on the nature of
the faster/slower scale inﬂation/deﬂation, and hence for the sake of
generality, one could introduce the symbol vσ ± (η ) (nontrivial applications of dynamical scale variations are considered in Sec. 5.3).
Further, out of the two variables t± , the smaller variable t− being also an asymptotic one, v− (η ) must respect the constraint
0 < v− (η ) < 1. The proportionality parameters λ± and λ are generally slowly varying functions of ε , depending on lower order scales
other than those appearing in t and η. Further characterizations of
the scaling exponents are given below.

v(η ) = |η|, for a linear η → 0, letting it dynamically insigniﬁcant.
For a nontrivial choice of v(η ), we have the following observations.

(4)

in the limit n → ∞, when λ± = real const. + o(1 ). Under this constraint, λ itself is a slowly varying constant. Consequently, it follows from inversion rule (3) that

v+ ( η ) = v− ( η )

Step 3: Self-dual vis-á-vis Trivial Ultrametric
The stronger triangular inequality satisﬁed by the self dual exponent v(η ) tells that v(η ) acts on N as an ultrametric norm [30].
Under such ultrametric norm the asymptotic set N naturally has
the structure of a totally disconnected set, while the value set of
the norm v(η ) can at most be countable [30]. The particular norm
that speciﬁes a constant O(1 ) value to each element of N is the
trivial ultrametric. It also follows in the present context that this
trivial norm, by its very deﬁnition, is self dual. This ultrametric
norm is constant over the set N , but could indeed be a function
on slow variables characteristic of the given nonlinear system.
Consequently, the self dual norm v(η ) acts as a trivial ultrametric
norm (valuation) over N when the proportionality parameter λ in the
inversion rule (3) is a slowly varying constant. However, in a dynamical problem it could be a real valued function of slowly varying
scales of the dynamical system.
Step 4: Non-self dual asymptotics
Depending on the choice of a scale δ (= ε −n ), the self dual exponent v(η ) could be extended to more general duality relations,
viz.,
(1) Weakly self dual (or weakly dual) exponents v− (η ) =
α (δ )v+ (η ), α (δ ) > 0, when λ in (3) is slowly varying as
O((log δ|k ), k a constant relative to n, but may, nevertheless, be
a function of  [2]. In that case deformation exponents acquire the
general forms given by

(5)

from self consistency, and hence, v+ (η ) must also respect the constraint 0 < v+ (η ) < 1. Consequently, the scaling exponents are said
to be self-dual exponents and denoted by the symbol v(η ) ∈ (0, 1 ).
The reason for this nomenclature is explained by the following
Proposition.
Proposition 2.1 (Duality or SL(2, R ) Invariance Properties
[1,2]). The scaling exponents v± (η ), denoted for brevity by v(η ), satisfy the following invariance properties. (1). v(kη ) = v(η ), for any
constant k, (2). v(η−1 ) = v(η ), (3). v(η − η0 ) = v(η ), for any η0 satisfying, for instance, the inequality 0 < |η0 | ≤ |η| ≤ 1, which are all
valid up to an additive null sequence o(1 ).
The proof of these invariance properties, viz., (1) Scaling, (2) Inversion and (3) Translation, follow directly from Deﬁnitions (a) and
(b). However, for completeness, we sketch here the proofs of inversion and translation invariance, (2) and (3) respectively. Further, we
set ψ0 = 1, in the proof, for simplicity. However, the proof remains
valid for an O(1) variation of ψ0 as well.
Proof of (2): For deﬁniteness, we work with t+ := τ −1 (say).
Then τ << 1, and the corresponding scale is ε n . By deﬁnition (4),

Parameters such as α , μ etc. appearing in above deﬁnitions can
also be slowly varying following various possible patterns that
could be discerned in a speciﬁc nonlinear problem. One veriﬁes
that (8) and (9) follow from deﬁnitions (2), (3) and (4) self consistently under the above constraints on the parameter λ.
Possible applications of weakly dual and strictly dual cases
would be considered in the context of period doubling bifurcations
in nonlinear oscillations in subsequent works. However, a number
theoretic application is considered in Sec. 5.4.
For later reference, let us formulate here a deﬁnition of the so
called duality structure, a novel inversive (multiplicative) structure
that should hold concomitantly over both the asymptotics t+ , t−
and the corresponding ﬁnitely realized valuations v+ (η ), v− (η ) respectively. Let, t+ , t− be two asymptotics relative to the primary
scale δ −1 := ε n and v+ (η ), v− (η ) be the corresponding ﬁnitely realized valuations, as deﬁned above.

since the second logarithmic term in second equality vanishes
faster (here 0 << t+0 < t+ ), proving the translation invariance.
(q.e.d.)
The translation invariance also reveals the ultrametric property
[30] of the scaling exponent v(η ). Indeed v(η ) deﬁnes an ultrametric norm on the set of the asymptotic variables N satisfying
the strong triangular property: v(η + η0 ) ≤ max{v(η ), v(η0 )}, η, η0
satisfying above inequalities. For a detail proof see [1,2].
Let us remark that the mapping t → v(η ) can be interpreted
(qualitatively, at the least) as a renormalization group action [24],
assigning a ﬁnite slowly varying value v(η ) to a diverging or null
sequence (i.e. t or t −1 ). The scaling exponent v(η ) could therefore
be referred either as the renormalized scaling exponent or the deformation scaling exponent.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let, t+ , t− be two asymptotics relative to the
primary scale δ −1 := ε n and v+ (η ), v− (η ) be the corresponding
ﬁnitely realized valuations, as deﬁned above. The joint multiplicative equalities given by

Remark 2.2. The dynamical inﬂation/deﬂation exponent ψ0 (ε −n )
with values in the neighbourhood of 1, allows a dynamical variable to inﬂate/deﬂate itself appropriately in a nonlinear evolutionary situation. In a purely linear problem, inﬂation exponent is irrelevant and hence ψ0 (ε −n ) = 1.
Further, in a linear problem, within the conventional classical mathematics, there is generally no need of an alteration of
the original metric (measure) property, even in the an asymptotic
regime. The system tends to maintain the initial evolutionary track

t− t+ = λ(δ )δ −2 , and

v− ( η )v+ ( η ) = μ ( δ ).

is called the duality structure on the extended real continuum R∗ .
Here, the proportionality parameter λ(δ ) is a slowly varying function, either of forms λ(δ ) ∼ O((| log δ| )k ), or λ(δ ) ∼ O(δ κ ), k, κ >
0 being real (slowly varying) constants, and μδ ∼ o(δ a ), 0 < a < 1
is slowly varying depending on the primary scale δ → 0+ .

Fermat ring type structure R∗ for a rigorous consideration of the
structures introduced here semi-formally. To facilitate this correspondence, we ﬁrst point out in the following section the relevance of the simplest scale invariant ﬁrst order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the context of our deﬁnitions of (self
dual) asymptotic variables in (2) and (3). Next, we relate and interpret deformation scaling exponents v± (η ) of the asymptotic duality structure with higher derivative discontinuous solutions of
the scale invariant ODE, the existence of which was constructively
demonstrated originally in [6]. A review of this construction along
with new, nontrivial properties of this class of novel solutions is
given below.

Step 5: Generalized Duality Structure
A nonlinear dynamical system usually reveal more and more
complicated structures in late time evolutions when the system
control parameter is varied concomitantly towards chaos threshold.
To accommodate most of such structures in the present formalism,
let us now generalize the inversive (multiplicative) duality structure to more general multiplicative structures among (trans)inﬁnite
asymptotics and the corresponding ﬁnite valuations, involving inverse polynomial functions, rather than simply of linear one, as in
(2.3).
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let, t+ , t− be two asymptotics relative to the primary scale δ := ε n and v+ (η ), v− (η ) be the corresponding ﬁnitely
realized valuations, as in deﬁnition (2.3). The joint multiplicative
equalities of the form given by

t− t+m = λ(δ )δ 2 , and

v− (η )Pm (v+ (η )) = μ(δ ).

3. Scale invariant linear ODE
The dual representation (2) of an asymptotic variable t → 0
lends itself to an interesting differential equation modeling, which
apparently seems to be trivial, though, does have nontrivial content. In the set of deformed null Cauchy sequences, the asymptotic
variable (scale) t is extended as

(11)

is called the generalized (polynomial) duality structure on the extended real continuum R∗ involving a polynomial Pm of degree m
of the valuation v+ . Here, the proportionality parameter λ(δ ) is
a slowly varying function, either of forms λ(δ ) ∼ O((| log δ| )k ), or
λ(δ ) ∼ O(δ κ ), k, κ > 0 being real (slowly varying) constants, and
μδ ∼ o(δ a ), 0 < a < 1 is slowly varying depending on the primary
scale δ → 0+ .

T± (t ) = t · t ∓v± (t )
T (t )+ · T (t )− = λ · t 2 .

We remark that for a linear polynomial P1 (v+ ) = v+ one retrieves the duality structure of deﬁnition (2.3). Since v+ assumes
values from the ﬁnite real continuum R, one can, however, contemplate on more general transformations, for instance, (1) Aﬃne:
when P1 (x ) = ax + b, (2) Quadratic: for P2 (x ) = ax2 + bx + c and etc.
The quadratic duality Eq. (9) is then modiﬁed to

av+ (η )2 − (aκ − b)v+ (η ) − (μ + bκ ) = o(1 )

(13)

satisfying the inversion rule

(14)

Here we simplify notations of (2) and denote by v(t ) the (self
dual) deformation exponent depending on the asymptotic variable.
Noticing that t is a t → 0 variable, (13) can be simpliﬁed to

T (t ) = t +

φ (t ), φ (t ) = v(t )t log(t −1 )

(15)

O((φ (t ))2 )

where we assume
= 0 and drop ± sign for simplicity. Consequently, φ (t ) is a nilsquare function. The deformed variable now solves the ODE dT
= 1, provided ddtφ = 0. We recover the
dt
classical model of real continuum R, when φ (t ) is a constant, so
that the deformation factor could, at the most, respect the scale
v = v, τ −1 = t log t −1 , provided v (t ) is assumed, at
free ODE τ −1 dτd−1
least, to be ﬁrst order continuously differentiable. Consequently, in
the conventional classical framework, the construction presented
in Sec. 3.1 should be trivial and vacuous. However, in an extension
of the form R∗ (or in R∗ ), this conclusion need not be true, as we
now demonstrate. Even in the context of real continuum R, when
one extends the usual general mode of increment of a real variable
by shift operation t → t + c to a special non-classical (nonstandard)
mode by inversion τ → τ −1 , in a close vicinity of 1, one encounters
new possibilities.
In this extended context, we now review the interesting construction of an explicit self similar generalized class of solutions
of the above scale free ODE having 2nd or higher derivative discontinuity [6]. We remark here that the classical smooth solution
of the above ODE is characterized by a single scale (∼ 1). However, the new construction will expose existence of several nontrivial smaller scales of the form ηn , η ≈ 0 for integer n > 0. The
original ODE is shown to replicated self similarly over such smaller
scales, thus yielding a nontrivial solution set [6].
Existence of this nontrivial class of new solutions now conﬁrm
that the constructions of Sec. 2 are nontrivial, and should have signiﬁcant applications in late time structures of nonlinear dynamics.

(12)

for the inverse aﬃne transformation, and similarly for higher degree polynomial transformations. In this generalized setting, inﬁnite (or inﬁnitesimal) asymptotics are modeled to undergo transitions (increments) only by a discrete number of inﬁnitesimal inversions (jumps), when the corresponding ﬁnite valuations could
accommodate nonlinear inverse polynomial transitions. Such nonlinear transition modes should be relevant for modeling bifurcation
issues in a nonlinear system.
2.3. Extension of real continuum: nonstandard or intuitionistic
The above construction of asymptotic structures by a sort of deformation and/or renormalization process on Cauchy null or divergent real sequences by a ﬁnitely valued valuation clearly presents a
model of real line accommodating active (dynamic) inﬁnitely small
and large quantities relative to a preassigned scale. Such quantities are realized dynamically from asymptotically trivial or divergent sequences invoking intelligently (or intuitively, so to speak)
nonlinear scaling exponents v± (η ) in an appropriate asymptotic
time scale. The choice of these exponents are left arbitrary, up to
the indicated duality constraints, and should always be available
in a nonlinear evolutionary problem for ﬁner asymptotic computations and analysis. The deformed null sequences, for instance,
now could be modeled as a concatenation of classical real continuum R into a nonstandard extension R∗ where the asymptotic
elements of R∗ − R admitting intuitionist continuum behaviour of
random choice sequences, temporality and etc. We also remind
that Giordano [11] introduced rings of Fermat’s real accommodating nilpotent inﬁnitesimals, analogous to SIA[21], but remaining completely within the framework of classical logic. As proved
in Proposition 3.2, present dynamically realized asymptotic structures in (2) could, indeed, be interpreted as nilpotent inﬁnitesimals
when the associated scaling exponents happen to belong to Fermat’s real, so that R∗ would have to be extended formally into a

get suﬃcient attention, and so we give a fair amount of details in
this review, bringing out some new intricacies in its structure that
should have potential new interpretations and applications in different folds of mathematical analysis, be it the classical nonstandard or in intuitionistic framework.
Let us begin by deﬁning notations. The solution is constructed
invoking a twisted (deformed) inversion mode in a subtle way.
Let tn± = 1 ± ηn , t0 ≡ t, η0 ≡ η, 0 < ηn << 1, αn = 1 + n , n =
0, 1, 2, . . . , and 0 = 0, 0 < n < 1(n  = 0 ), such that n → 0, as n →
∞ (we retain the symbol α0 for the sake of symmetry). Next,
we write tn ± = 1 ± αn ηn ± , so that αn tn± = tn ± . Consequently, ηn ± =
ηn ± αnn . Denote by t˜n ± = 1 ± αn ηn ∓ a scaling ansatz that we call
twisted scaling variables. Here, αn (and n ) are scaling parameters.
n
A useful choice in a dynamical system, however, is n =  2 ,  =

1 . As will become evident, η(n+1)± = αn ηn± .
To construct a nontrivial solution (with the initial condition
τ (1 ) = 1), we begin with an initial approximate solution in the
small scale variable η0 , and then obtain recursively self-similar corrections over smaller and smaller scale variables η02 , η04 , . . .. To this

thus verifying that the scale free Eq. (16) is solved exactly by the
new solution: t ddτt = τ , provided the solution is deduced by following the above mentioned self similar replications of the original Eq. (16) on smaller and smaller deformed scales. This concludes our construction of a second derivative discontinuous solution. Let us note that 4th and higher derivative discontinuous solutions could also be generated from the above type of constructions
when nontrivial initial rescaling is invoked at the appropriate level.
For example, 4th order discontinuity is generated when ﬁrst nontrivial rescaling is enacted at the 2nd level of the iteration process,
and more generally 2n th order discontinuity is obtained when initial nontrivial scaling is injected at the nth stage of the iteration
[6]. We also remark that another class of nontrivial solutions can
be constructed by replacing (-) sign by (+) sign and vice verse in
Eqs. (17) and (23) and using appropriate twisted scaling variables
and twisted inversions. In this case the twisted inversions are realized along τ+ branch, when in (17) the same was realized along
τ− branch of the solution.
Next, we note from (23) that τ− = τs− (1 + O(η02 )) (c.f. Sec. 3.2),
besides the arbitrariness of the scaling parameters n . Combining
the standard and the new solutions together, one can ﬁnally write
down a more general class of generalized solutions G (R ) involving

and tn− = 1 − αn2−1 η( n2−1 )− ≡ 1 − ηn− . We also note that t˜+

since α0 = 1.
Plugging in the initial condition τ± = 1 at t± = 1 (viz., η0 = 0),
one obtains ﬁnally the desired nontrivial solution τn as



1+η0 1+η0

It thus follows that the solution (23), with nonzero scaling parameters, is indeed nontrivial, because of this second derivative
discontinuity at η0 = 0, that is at t = 1. In fact, the scaling invariance of Eq. (16) tells also that, t = 1 could be realized as t → t/t0 =
1, so that the nontrivial solution (23) actually holds in the neighbourhood of every real number t0 , the 2nd derivative being discontinuous at t = t0 .
It should be clear from above considerations that standard solution in the left hand side, viz, τs− = 1 − η0 = t− gets deformed
to the new solution τN− by this operation of repeated small scale
twisted scaling, by a speciﬁc, but as yet undetermined, choice of
the sequence of the scaling parameters n , with only condition that
0 < n << 1 such that n → 0, n → ∞. The intricate structure of
this deformation is recognized by expanding the initial segment of
the new solution (23):

where fn satisﬁes the nth generation self-similar equation

τs− (suﬃx 0 indicates new inﬁnite product representation of standard solution with trivial scale parameters n = 0).

3.1.1. Symmetry breaking
An interesting property of the new solution (23) is the fact
that it breaks spontaneously the reﬂection (parity) symmetry of
(16). Let P : Pt± = t∓ denote the reﬂection transformation near t =
1 (P η = −η near η = 0). Clearly, Eq. (16) is parity symmetric. So
is the standard solution τs± = t± (since P τs = τs ). However, the
solution (23) breaks this discrete symmetry spontaneously: τ−P =

Eq. (16), but clearly differs from the original solution, τ±P  = τ± because it now belongs to a different class of solutions. The explicit
breaking of the parity symmetry is an important new feature of
the solution (23). It is, however, important to realize that the nontrivial self similar correction factor in (23), being a function of η02 is
reﬂection (η0 ↔ −η0 ) symmetric. This remark would have a significant interpretation in context of asymptotic duality (see Sec. 3.5).
We remark here that by various judicious variations of the two
components nontrivial solutions and involving different choices of
nontrivial scaling parameters one can construct not only more general symmetry broken solutions, but also a nontrivial class of symmetric solutions that is distinct from the standard classical solution

Notice that as new factors depending on next smaller scales
appear successively in the new solution (23), the accuracy (relative error) of the approximate solutions can not be improved beyond the defect size D  σ1 η02 + O(η04 ) that remains nonvanishing
for a ﬁxed η0 , contrary to the classical notion of inﬁnite accuracy.
Clearly, the loss of second derivative is a consequence of such irreducible defects. At this approximation, the discontinuity in the
second derivative is of order ∼ 2σ1 , that can be veriﬁed by direct computations (Appendix A, Lemma A.3). For a nontrivial result, i.e. σ1  = 0, the nonzero scaling parameters 0 < i << 1 must
be restricted by approximate nilpotent conditions [11] of the form
O(12 )  = 0 but O(13 ) ≈ 0 when O(i )  = 0 but O(i2 ), O(i  j ) ≈ 0
for i > 1. This choice will allow not only an easy estimation of desired results, but also conﬁrm a genuine second derivative discontinuity σ1 > 0. For a smaller choice of 1 > 0 so that 12 ≈ 0, one
gets the trivial result σ1 = 0, indicating that the loss of derivatives
could only be expected at a higher order only (Lemma A.3).
An important conclusion from the above results is the fact
that the new solutions enjoy two fold indeterminacy: one entering
from the arbitrariness of the scaling parameters n and the second
arising from the irreducibility of defects leading to higher order
derivative discontinuity. Consequently, it is reasonable to estimate
the nonsmooth solutions only up to a desired level of accuracy,
for instance, O(η04 ) for the second order, O(η08 ) for the 4th order
derivative discontinuity and so on (Lemma A.2). The self similarity
of the process also tells that the defect of size σ1 η02 for second order nonsmoothness would replicate as σ1 η04 for fourth order nonsmoothness and so on for higher order cases. Under such scaling
hypotheses the loss of derivatives may be encountered at the 4th
or higher order.
Another important feature of this nonlinear process is the
following. In the trivial process (without rescaling) the successive partial products (1 + η0 )−1 , (1 + η0 )−1 (1 + η02 )−1 etc actually overestimates the respective intervals [1 − η0n , 1 + η0n ], n =
1, 2, . . . by lengths of the order η02 , η04 etc that diminishes as
uniform geometric sequence. However, the nontrivial process is
nonuniform, since there exists irreducible defects of order σ11 η02 +

(t+ t1+ t2+ ) and so on at every stage of iteration, where σ1 =
σ11 + σ12 + . . ., σ2 = σ21 + σ22 + . . .. Hence, the nonlinear (twisted
inversive) process can, in fact, eliminate only a Cantor set of
measure ∼ (1 − σ1 )η02 from the original excess estimate ∼ η02

3.2. Special features and geometrical meaning
Let us recall that in the absence of nontrivial rescaling, a generalized solution of the form (23) reduces to the trivial standard solution. This tells that inversion in the neighbourhood of 1 by itself
fails to inject any new feature in the solution space, besides the
apparent inﬁnite product representation. The reason for failure can
be associated to the fact that increment via inversion, though nonlinear, is well determinate in nature and hence fails to reproduce
any new aspect in small scale behaviour of linear system even after its repeated applications an inﬁnity of times.
Things change signiﬁcantly when nontrivial rescalings are enacted. At each step, the scaling ansatz (17), that is invoked on an
O(1) variable tn , ﬁrst transfers the actual effect to the corresponding small scale variable ηn −1 by displacing its origin by O(n ). The
O(1) multiplicative structure of the form t− · t+ ∝ 1 in association
with O(1) scaling variable αn = 1 + n , at the appropriate level of
iteration then introduces a nontrivial (quadratic, i.e., of the form
ηn+1 = αn2 ηn 2 ) deformation to the original small scale variable η in
an irreversible manner by breaking the higher order differentiability
structure of the linear system, when of course n → ∞. To remind,
we call this inﬁnite sequence of inversions and rescalings as the
deformative (twisted) inversions in the vicinity of 1.
Notice that the nontrivial solution structure depends crucially
on the nontiviality of the scaling hypothesis involving inﬁnity of
nontrivial scale factors, injected over, at least, a subsequence of self
similarly enlarged ODEs. Since, for every given choice of the scale
factors, the construction yields a deﬁnite nonsmooth solution, having special differentiability and geometric behaviour, the solution
set consisting of the generalized solutions of (16), is not a singleton set, as in the case of smooth classical solution, that is unique,
up to initial conditions.

when one makes use of the identity (1 − η )−1 = 0 (1 + η2 ). The
ﬁrst two nontrivial factors φ1 and φ2 involving scale factors α1
and α2 respectively are incisionally active, as these two factors can
be expanded as [(1 − η04 ) + σ1 η02 + higher order term], with an irreducible defect of approximate size ∼ σ1 η02 . In the general situation when all the subsequent scaling parameters i are also
nonzero, but, nevertheless, are assumed to satisfy nilpotent conditions i  = 0 but i2 = 0, i > 1, all the higher order factors are also
active though contributing negligibly (O(η04 ) or higher), and hence
should be irrelevant for the zeroth level interval of size O(η02 ).
4
In other words, ∞
3 φn = 1 + O (η0 ) and hence each of these factors behave approximately as benign. However, in the absence of
any nilpotency condition these factors are nonetheless active and
would contribute successively higher order defects of sizes O(η4 )
and etc. Incidentally, we remark that the nontrivial O(η02 ) defect
arises from the joint contributions of φ1 and φ2 under the nilpotency condition 1 , 12  = 0 but 13 = 0. By self similarity, this property should be true at every level of higher scales O(η0n ) as well.
Next, as an example of nontrivial gaps and benign factors, let
us assume that after having inserted nontrivial scale factors α1 , α2
(i.e. at the recursion level n = 1 and 2), choice of a new nontrivial
scaling is delayed up to an arbitrarily large, but nevertheless ﬁnite,
integer N, so that the large but ﬁnite string of factors in (30) from
4
n = 3 to n = N − 1 are all benign and hence N
3 φn = 1 + O (η0 ).
Since in any computational model or practical problem, such factors would yield inﬁnitesimal (negligible, higher order) corrections
only, for a suﬃciently large N, such a value of N could be computationally interpreted as a model of an inﬁnitely large integer (in the
sense of NSA [8,9]). Hence the solution (30) could be realized as a
nontrivial generalized solution with only one defect of size ∼ σ1 η02 .
Injection of a new nontrivial scaling αm > 1 at the stage m then
have the possibility of computationally (dynamically) realizing a
scenario with two defects of sizes ∼ σ1 η02 and ∼ σm η02m , when m is
only moderately large and separated by a relative distance of order
1 − η2m−1 , and so on.
Thus, although an inﬁnity of twisted (deformative) transformations at smaller scales are, in principle, necessary for realizing a
nontrivial element belonging to the generalized nonsmooth solution space of (16), such a nonlinear inﬁnite process should be realizable in practical dynamical or computational model when ‘inﬁnity’ is interpreted in a relative sense, as a very large integer, so
that the error committed in the process is ‘inﬁnitesimally small’.
The signiﬁcance of ﬁnitely realizable defects of various sizes (in the
above relative sense) would be studied separately.
n

(Lemma A.4, Appendix A). Consequently, nonlinear deletion process involving inﬁnity of choices regarding scaling parameters may
be said to generate an ineﬃcient deletion process in comparison to
the trivial one without involving any choice. Further, the factor σ1
above in (29), interpreted as the relative defect size of an initial
interval of size η02 , is now identiﬁed as relative size of the Cantor
string [25] that has emerged spontaneously (dynamically) in the
initial zeroth level interval [1 − η0 , 1 + η0 ] from the nontrivial construction.
The emergence of a positive measure Cantor set structure in
a neighbourhood of O(η02 ) is an interesting feature that asks for
more detail separate investigation. We remark here that a linear
closed neighbourhood of the form [−η, η] in R may not simply
vanish as η → 0, instead one might expect, in the light of above
nonlinear construction, that a Cantor string of size O(σ1 η2 ) would
linger behind as η recedes to zero.
Finally, one may ask if the small scale motion is also captured
−1
m , m > 0. It
by more general inversion modes such as t− → t−
= t+
−1
turns out that nonlinear increment t− → t− = t+ is uniquely realized when the small scale motion is modeled by the self similar
process detailed in Sec. 2 in the context of (16). For more general
power law (m > 0 ) the corresponding ODE should be of the type
t ddτt = mτ , the general process of constructing a nonlinear mode
follows as above. One does not expect any new feature to emerge
from such constructions other than those highlighted here.
3.3. Finite vs. inﬁnite
From above discussions, one may feel that an inﬁnity of recursions involving both inversions and nontrivial small scale deformative rescalings is essential to generate the nonlinear solution structures in a linear ODE. Although, this is true, in principle, but there
is a caveat. First, let us notice that if the freedom of introducing
new rescaling parameters is withheld after a ﬁnite number of nontrivial choices, then subsequent inﬁnity of pure inversive transformations would successfully unwind the initial ﬁnite sequence of nonlinear deformations, that have been acted upon the smaller scales, and
would yield at the end the classical smooth solution uniquely. This
can be veriﬁed easily from the nonlinear solution (23) and also
(25), when one makes use of only 3 nontrivial scaling parameters
αi , i = 1, 2, 3, for instance, and then disallowing any further new
such parameters in subsequent iterations. Consequently, inﬁnity of
 t  t  . . . )−1 would converge to t  , alsubsequent strings viz. (t3+
4+ 5+
3−
lowing eﬃcient cancellation of initial factors and ﬁnally reducing
to the classical solution.
However, such eﬃcient unwind of smaller scale ﬁnite number of deformations and associated cancellation of initial factors
are forbidden when an inﬁnite subsequent sequence of new scaling choices are invoked successively or with possible gaps of arbitrarily large, but ﬁnite, lengths. To clarify how gaps arise let us
assume that a set of the scaling parameters α j , j = 3, 4, . . . , 10,
for instance, are all trivial i.e. α j = 1,  j = 0, j = 3, 4, . . . , 10, after a nontrivial α2 . Next nontrivial scaling is invoked at the iteration level 11, say, and so on ad inﬁnitum with several such possible
empty strings of scaling sequences. Since the subsequence of nontrivial scaling parameters is inﬁnite, the construction would produce a new nontrivial solution other than the standard solution.
Next, let us recall that the nontrivial solution (23) has an inﬁnite product structure and each factor in the product has the interpretation of an incision operation, either nascent (benign) or active,
that is being acted upon a neighbourhood of initial size O(η02 ). A
nontrivial solution (23) can now be rewritten as

3.4. Extension to more general solution space
The general construction outlined in Sec. 3.1 tells that the ini−1
tial approximate ansatz for the solution of the form τ− = t+
≡
(1 + η0 )−1 , in the vicinity of 1, is improved successively by adding
self similar correction factors of the 1/tn + over smaller scales of
n
the form η02 . Notice that the initial choice (1 + η0 )−1 is motivated of course by the conventional intuition of classical neighbourhoods, being represented ordinarily as linear (closed or open)
intervals. Once the nonlinear construction reveals the possibility
of a more intricate neighbourhood structure (of ‘dynamical real
n
(physical) continuum’) [5] involving smaller nonlinear scales η02 ,
one is now free to investigate further to see if the original linear neighbourhood could proliferate further as odd powers of η0 as
well. One would realize that this question immediately settle the
question of constructing a generalized solution having discontinuity at an odd order, for instance 3rd, 5th, and so on. More interestingly, following this type of reasoning, one could study the possibility of general question of differentiability of a family of continuous functions [c.f. Sec. 5].

nontrivial existence of v± in the context of nonlinear evolutionary problem. However, that framework could be further expanded
to include even innocuous linear systems, when solutions are constructed, not simply following classical methods, but by application of a nonlinear construction process involving twisted rescalings and inversions.
As an explicit exercise, we now present steps of converting the
nonsmooth solution (23) in the vicinity of 1, into a form analogous to (31) and identify the deformation scaling exponents v±
involving smaller scales. Let T± (t ) and t be smooth solutions of
(16). Further, suppose these are asymptotic, viz, T± (t ) and t → 0,
say. Thus, as the smooth variable t approaches to 0, the smaller
scales of the form η0n , n > 1 can be activated, allowing one to access the nontrivial solution set, provided a choice of twisted rescalings and inversions is invoked. The unique classical choice is now
replaced by hosts of new possibilities, and to capture this manifoldness, the classical smooth variable t is eliminated (renormalized out) in favour of two dually related asymptotic variables T˜±

To explain the above arguments, we brieﬂy give an outline of
constructing a generalized solution having 3rd order discontinuity. To this effect, let us begin from the original ansatz (17), but
replace (c.f. Remark3.1) the initial approximate factor by the new
factor 1/t+ , t+ = 1 + η˜ , where η˜ is assumed to be power law of the
original linear smaller scale variable η0 : η˜ = η0a , a > 0. Next, we
repeat exactly the subsequent self similar construction involving
deformative rescalings and local inversions, yielding again a generalized solution belonging apparently to the class (23).
The solution constructed as above actually belongs to a different class of solution set involving 3rd, and possibly higher viz, 6th,
12th, so on..., order discontinuity, that stems from the initial power
law η˜ = η0a when a is chosen as a = 3/2. Indeed, one can check
easily that the for 3rd order discontinuity, the estimated defect is
∼ σ1 η˜ 2 = σ1 η03 for a = 3/2, and hence the 3rd order derivative is
indeed discontinuous. This can be checked directly from the solution (23). First and second order derivatives are however zero
for η0 = 0. For 5th order and higher odd order discontinuity, one
should work with fractional smaller scales η05/2 , η07/2 and etc.
It follows ﬁnally that the global loss of derivative continuity at
rth order is inherited from the lowest power in the defect size ∼ σ1 η0r ,
that in turn is inherited from the microscopic smaller scale structure
of the form ∼ η0r/2 . Thus, to put in a picturesque manner, we arrive
at an interesting global - local conﬂuence. To study implications
of this principle in dynamical systems and bifurcation theory require separate investigations. In Sec. 5.1, we begin to extend some
of these results to second order differential systems.

involving a replica of new generalized solutions in the vicinity of
1, in the form

T˜± (t ) := T± (t )/t = t̄ ∓v± (η˜ )

where v± (η˜ ) has the general structure assigned by deﬁnition
(4) and has, in the context of the linear ODE, the explicit representations

v± (η˜ ) =

Remark 3.1. The replacement of the initial linear variable t+ =
1 + η is facilitated by the reparametrization invariance of a real
constant: in the limit η → 0 the classical smooth solution attains
a constant value τ− (1 ) = 1 so that dτ−dt(1 ) = 0, ⇒ the independent
variable t = 1 + η can be replaced by a function η˜ (η ) > 0, η˜ (0 ) = 0.
Classically this should be a trivial exercise. However, in the present
framework, the limit η → 0 is interpreted nontrivially as demonstrated in the construction of (23), and thus exposing presence of
nonlinear scales. The solution (23) makes explicit a sequence of
deformed scales involving powers of 2, viz, 1, 2, 22 , 23 , . . .. Once
these ﬁrst generation nonlinear scales are exhausted, the possibility of third and higher order (2 · 3n−1 ) loss of derivatives mani2
fest via scales of the form η3 , η3·2 , η3·2 , . . ., and so on successively for higher odd integers. One thus arrives at a realization of
Sharkovisky sequence [26] of natural numbers as powers of nonlinear scales. Understanding implications of this sequence and the
role of the corresponding ordering in linear systems needs further
investigations.

It follows from the formulae (33) and (30) the important fact that
v is now determined uniquely by the defect sizes realized from the
incision factors φn± [c.f. Sec. 3.2] in the context of (16). We summarize above results as a proposition.

3.5. Nonsmooth solution vs. asymptotic duality

Proposition 3.2. The asymptotic duality (2) and (3) formulated on
an extended R, denoted R∗ can exist nontrivially in the generalized
nonsmooth solution set of the scale invariant equation (16). The corresponding deformation scaling exponents v± are given by the formula
(33) involving incision factors and hence determined uniquely by the
associated irreducible defects in the form

As remarked already in Sec. 3, renormalized (self dual) scaling
exponents (4) of Sec. 2.2 and associated asymptotic duality structure can in fact exist nontrivially as generalized solution of the
scale free ODE (16) (c.f. (15)). In fact, recalling the deﬁnitions of
asymptotic variables, as represented in (13), viz,

T± (t ) = t · t ∓v± (η˜ )

(32)

v± (η˜ )| log t˜| =

(31)

M

one may assume the variables t, T± to belong to the solution set
of scale invariant equation (16). Restricting t, T± to the classical smooth solution, one may infer the representation (31) to be
empty (trivial) in content so that v± (η˜ ) = 0 identically. Recall that
(item 3, Sec. 2.2) v± in (31) should be constant relative to the original variable t, but can be nontrivial on nonlinear smaller scales.
In view of the nonlinear self similar construction above, the
scaling exponents v± can now exist nontrivially as functions of
deformed smaller scales, as revealed by the new construction. In
the formulation of asymptotic duality in Sec. 2.2, we motivated

vi± =

M


σi± η2i+1

(35)

where M is suﬃciently large, so that error in the solution (23) is
O(η2(M+1 ) ). Accordingly, the scaling exponents v± (η˜ ) exist nontrivially on the space of generalized solutions (23). The scaling exponent is self dual when identical choice is made along both the
branches, i.e. i− = i+ . The scaling exponents v± are therefore indeterminate and could at best be determined upto O(η2 ), relative to the
zeroth level scale η. In general, relative to a scale ηi , the corresponding scaling exponent is determined analogously as vi± = σi± η2i+1 +
O(η2i+2 ) = (σi± η + O(η2 ))| log ti± |, ti± = 1 ± η2i by self similarity of

and hence higher order scaling exponents are realized successively
when lower order factors are dynamically renormalized out. Finally,

3.5.1. Examples
1. In the particular case when the generalized solution considered involves nontrivial 1 , 2 together with an arbitrarily long gap
of size N, then all the higher order N − 2 factors in (33) are benign, excepting the ﬁrst two nontrivial incision factors viz, φ1± (η2 )
and φ2± (η4 ). The next nontrivial scaling deformation is enacted at
n
the N + 1th iteration. In that case factors φn± = 1 + O(η2 ), n =

factors for n = 1, 2 simpliﬁes to φ1± · φ2± = 1 + σ1± η2 + O(η4 ) ≈
2
eσ1± η , (Lemma A.1) thereby yielding relevant scaling exponents as
v± (log t1 ) log t˜+ ≈ σ1± η2 .
We have thus arrived at an example giving explicit realizations
of the weakly self dual and self dual asymptotics and the corresponding scaling exponents. Clearly, v± ≈ log(φ1 φ2 )/ log t˜+ ≈ σ1± η
are weakly self dual, when one makes two independent scaling
choices in the form i± , i = 1, 2 at the ﬁrst two nontrivial iterations along both the branches. For identical choice i− = i+ , one
obtains a self dual scaling exponent.
2. The symmetry broken solution (23) belongs to another limiting realization of weakly self dual asymptotics when i+ → 0, so
that v− = σ1− η2 but v+ → 0.
3. A particular realization of the weakly self dual asymptotics
can be modeled by the symmetry broken pair of nonclassical solutions viz, τN and τ˜N = P τN , where P being the parity transformation.

We list here a few important properties of the incision factors:

1. The incision factors are, by construction, positive, i.e.

2. It is multiplicative: φ± (tn ) = φn± (tn ).
3. Incision factors are inversion invariant in the vicinity of 1:
φn (tn −1 ) = φn (tn ). As a function of smaller scales this means that
φn (−η0 ) = φn (η0 ), since φn is a rational function, the denominator
of which is polynomial of degree 2n . This also veriﬁes local inversion (reﬂection) invariance of deformation scaling exponents v± of
Proposition 2.1.
Before closing this section, let us make an important remark
on, what may be called a global-local structure relation, that is revealed by the construction of the new class of generalized solutions of the scale invariant Eq. (16). Recall that a nontrivial feature
of new solutions is that the action of an O(1) scaling on a variable t in the vicinity of 1 has been transferred to the vicinity of
0, introducing a localized deformation on the original small scale
variable η. Inﬁnite succession of such transformations in association with localized inversions then produce a global deformation
in the solution space in the form of higher derivative discontinuity
and nonsmooth character.
Rewriting the solution (30) as C −1 τN /τs = R (t  ) and using the
i
identity (1 − η2 )∞
(1 + η2 ) = 1, the incision correction factor in

the class of generalized solutions in the vicinity of 1, the above
observation translates into the general global-local structure relation

of the smaller scale structure function involving scales smaller that
η1 .
It follows that both the structure functions, global R and local
˜ R are (generalized) constants respecting the benign looking alge
braic constraint (37), but that must be interpreted dynamically so
that the constants experience discrete jumps at scale changes. Consequently, these are staircase functions. Because of intrinsic deformations, however, both the point of scale change and jump sizes
are distributed nonuniformly, making the limiting staircase functions irregular and so of fractal nature. The constant k1 appears
from scaling deformations of smaller scales, in absence of which all
the nonlinear scales vanish at η = 0, thus reducing (37) to the triv˜ R (0 ) = 0. It also follows immediately
ial case of smooth solution: 
that the ﬁrst derivative of a generalized solution (23) is a generalized constant (being proportional to R ) and hence is a fractal
staircase function.
We shall extend this structure equation on function space in
Sec. 5.

The proof of this Proposition follows directly from representations (32), (33) and Lemma A.1 (Appendix A). The nontrivial existence of v± (η˜ ) follows from (15) and (33). That T± (t ) are Fermat inﬁnitesimals follow from (1) when one notes that t | log t | <
t 1−α , α > 0 and v± (η ) ∈ R, since smaller variables η are constants
relative to the primary variable t. Finite differentiability of v± (η ),
and vi± follow from the fact that v± , vi± ∈ G (R ) as functions of
smaller variables η. For a function with second derivative discontinuity of the form v(η ) = σ1 η + O(η2 ), one can ﬁnd suﬃciently
slowly varying 0 < β < 1 such that v(η ) = η (1 + kηβ ) and hence
from (1), v(η )/η is a Fermat’s real [11]. Similarly, for vi , i > 1.

The class of generalized solutions (23) and (27) reveals a number of interesting aspects of the concept of real continuum. Let
us recall two major components in deriving a nontrivial solution:
(1) inversion modes for increment close to 1 inducing a nonlinear structure in the original linear one and (2) application of a
set of scaling deformation parameters to deform the original small
scale variable η. An interpretation of this class of generalized solutions was offered in [6] based on a heuristic computational model,

mals which are mainly nilsquare or nilpotent type (φ  = 0, φ 2 = 0)
[21,22], besides a possible class of invertible inﬁnitesimals[11,19].
We must, however, remark that the formalism of duality structure and constructions of nontrivial solution class of the ODE
(16) have been undertaken in the framework of standard classical
mathematics, besides invoking new incremental modes in association with judicious application of iterated rescaling. It is of interest
to perceive this extended framework to enjoy certain ﬂavours and
features of intuitionistic mathematics, which deserves more investigations.

and suggesting a possible realization of such a solution in a nonstandard universe and more speciﬁcally in the context of intelligent living systems [5,6]. The philosophy that is being emerged
out of these and the present analysis is that a living system must
be one, that enjoys a special quality of invoking, whenever necessary,
spontaneously and intelligently, right choices of sequences of scaling
parameters and nonlinear small scale inversion modes, so as to inject irreversible deformation in the original benign system, towards a
more complex emerging structure. Such a scenario is already evident
in the process of deriving the nontrivial solution even in the very
simple linear system. The freedom of incrementing in a dynamical
evolution by sudden twisted inversion modes (Sec. 3.1) that is key
in this derivation appears also to be a very welcome feature for
an intelligent system that stands distinctly outside the scope of an
inanimate physical system. In [5], we also presented an interesting application of this generalized class of solutions in the context
of a possible intelligent version of ﬁrst law of motion of classical
mechanics. In the presence of an intelligent decision mechanism,
the standard second law of motion is expected to yield novel dynamical features not available in conventional classical mechanics.
A few examples in the context of nonlinear oscillation problems
have been presented in Sec. 5.2 and Sec. 5.3.
Broken parity symmetry of the new class of solutions is another
quite signiﬁcant aspect as such a property seems to be deeply related to the “arrow of time”. The perception of the ﬂowing time
onward is a hallmark of a living intelligent object. Possible applications of new class of solutions in this context was already highlighted in [5,27].
We remark here that the formulation of asymptotic duality in
Sec. 2 is motivated originally from the insights of the above derivation [1,2]. Any dynamical variable, for instance, time variable t, ordinarily modeled as a (classical) real continuum variable. But, in
the present more extended context, the real continuum, R is imbibed, so to speak, with a sense of perception of being embedded in a larger nonstandard like extension R∗ (more precisely, in
R∗ ), endowed with dynamically active inﬁnitely small and large
quantities. Such an extension is realized in the present formalism
by (intelligently) deforming Cauchy null or divergent sequences by
invoking the principle of asymptotic duality structure, as indicated
in Sec. 2.2. Before presenting nontrivial applications of the duality
structure in following sections, let us now draw some parallels of
the new intuitions with the Intuitionist approach to inﬁnitesimals
and that of Nonstandard analysis and recently developed Fermat’s
real continuum.

4.2. Nonstandard analysis and fermat’s real
As alluded to already above, iterative application of nontrivial
rescaling and inversion modes in a vicinity of 1, renders the standard solution path of a system to deviate into the monad of standard real point 1, realized in a nonstandard extension R∗ of ordinary reals R. However, it is rather surprising to realize that such
inﬁnitesimal itinerary of the original smooth classical path could
have such drastic effect even on the O(1) large scale behaviour, as
is evidenced here in the spontaneous breaking of the smoothness
property of the (linear) system as well as in the loss of reﬂection
(parity) symmetry. This appears, to author’s view, a possible nascent
presence of active (dynamic, or life like) principles, that can only be
activated asymptotically in a system, linear or nonlinear, by judicious
applications of above type of non-classical modes recursively, as presented here.
4.2.1. Fermat’s real
In our construction of asymptotic duality, asymptotic objects
are deﬁned using Landau little-oh notations o(t ) or o(1 ) (viz,
x(t ) = o(t ) ⇒ |x/t | → 0 as t → 0). The nonstandard extension R∗
consistent with the constructions of Sec. 2.2 could obviously be realized as the ring of Fermat real of [11]. Let us notice ﬁrst that
deﬁnition of deformed Cauchy null sequence (in a slightly altered
notation and dropping ± signs) can be written as T (t ) = t + v(η ) ·
t log σ (t )−1 + o(1 ) so that T (t ) ∼ t that implies T (t ) ∈ [t] ≡ {0}. In
other words, null sequence T(t) is indistinguishable from t, and so
we are still at the level of R, the real continuum and the presence of the renormalizable small scale component v(η ) is not felt.
However, once the dominant null (or divergent) term is eliminated
in a dynamical process, the small scale deformation scaling exponent v(η ) becomes manifest. As pointed out in Sec. 3.5, this scaling
exponent could be realized as a generalized solution of the scale
free Eq. (16) and hence belongs to the ring of Fermat reals [11].
Consequently, we conclude that the asymptotic constructions presented here could be interpreted as members of R∗ , the ring of
Fermat real, that extends an usual nonstandard extension R∗ , viz,
R ∗ ⊇ R∗ ⊇ R.

4.1. Intuitionist
Intuitionist real continuum consists of equivalence classes of
choice sequences. For details we refer to [10,14,15]. A salient feature of a choice sequence is its temporality, viz, its deﬁnition generally involves a subtle perception of time ﬂow. An intuitionist
number is constructive, an initial segment of the relevant choice
sequence is usually well determined digits, while determination of
subsequent digits require an act of decision (choice) based on the
future progress of time (for examples please see [10]). So future is
‘open’, so to speak, for a dynamical system to evolve into newer
possibilities, not traditionally foreseeable.
In the context of scale invariant linear ODE, new emergent patterns are revealed by application of judicious scalings and inversion modes, self similarly over many smaller scales. This scenario
is generally unavailable in the scope of classical analysis and dynamics. It is of interest to visualize the act of multiple scalings involving nilpotent quantities (Lemma A.3), being a deliberate interjection of an intuitionist mathematician (recall Brower’s proposal
of an ideal mathematician [17]), involving intuitionist inﬁnitesi-

5. Applications to dynamical systems
In this section, we study extensions of above small scale inﬁnitesimal construction in more general dynamical systems, and in
particular, to nonlinear oscillations. We present some novel results
involving self similar extensions of second order differentiable systems over smaller nonlinear scales, generalizing the nonlinear constructions of asymptotic duality (Sec. 2.2) and nonsmooth solutions
of linear scale invariant system (Sec. 3.1).
5.1. Asymptotic duality on function spaces
Asymptotic duality of Sec 2.2 was originally introduced heuristically in the context of Cantor sets [28,29], which was later formalized in the context of real continuum R by deforming Cauchy
null and divergent sequences jointly. Because of the scaling and
12

D.P. Datta

Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 152 (2021) 111457

inversion invariance of the constructions involved, the deformation
scaling exponents v± are not only invariant under those transformations, but essentially are nilpotent polynomials (1) with dominant term being O(1) (and hence belongs to R∗ ) and also reﬂection
symmetric in smaller nonlinear scales η . The ansatz (31) considered in Sec 3.5 also tells that we have been considering, in fact,
an extension of the original duality deﬁnition for real continuum
(2) to a function space (13), for instance, of the generalized solution space G (R ) of the linear ODE (16). Analysis presented so far
makes it clear that asymptotic duality concepts provide a novel approach in zooming into a nonlinear neighbourhood of 1 (say) of
real continuum through the window of generalized nonsmooth solutions of the scale invariant ODE (16). We now make the approach
more formal and applicable to a general function space.
Let t ∈ R be asymptotic to 0. Assume T (t )± ∈ C r (R, R ), the space
of functions with rth continuous derivative (r may also be ∞). For
deﬁniteness, we call such functions as smooth. Assume also that
T± asymptotic to 0 with t. Suppose that the asymptotic t bifurcates into two dual components t± relative to a scale δ (c.f. Definition 2(a) of Sec. 2.2). Rescaling we write them as t˜± = t± /δ residing in a neighbourhood of 1. We drop (˜· ) sign henceforth and
assume all variables in the vicinity of 1. We call the interval of
the form (1 − ηn , 1 + ηn ) ⊂ R a linear neighbourhood in R (higher
powers in n > 1 is superﬂuous, since in absence of deformations,
these correspond to trivial factorization of zeroth level linear interval (1 − η, 1 + η )).
Asymptotic duality now provides a tool to access deeper nonlinear deformed structures in the vicinity of 1 denoted as N1 and
so assume t ∈ N1 . The corresponding small scale variables | log t |
then are members of N0 , the nonlinear neighbourhood of 0, N0
being homeomorphic to N 1 . To distinguish the linear (smooth) and
nonlinear (nonsmooth) aspect of a real variable, we henceforth reserve t (or η) for linear variable in the linear neighbourhood of 1
(or 0), when t  (or η ) to denote deformed nonlinear variable in N1
(or N0 ). It follows, therefore, that η = v(η ), from the deﬁnition of
deformation scaling exponent (2) and (4). Let us now proceed in
several steps.
Step 1. Assume ﬁrst that T± (t± ) solves ﬁrst order linear ODE
(16) in appropriate variables, and so also belongs to a neighbourhood of 1 (not necessarily the original one).
Step 2. The duality relation (13) and (14) is now interpreted
as an extension of the original ground level structure on R to the
function (solution) space G (R ) of (16). The constant parameter λ
in real continuum R in (14) now has the inﬁnite product incision
factor representation of the form (30). Generally, this representation involves two inﬁnite products coming from two branches
T± (λ = λ− λ+ ). The associated defects D± are determined from
Lemma A.1 (Appendix A).
Step 3. Exploiting homogeneity and scale invariant structure of
the ODE (16), the structure (14), near 1, extends to ﬁrst derivatives:

T−  (t− ) · T+  (t+ ) = λ(| log t± | )

volving smaller nonlinear scales from incision factor representation (30) and clearly determines and also gets determined by the
lowest degree defects in the ineﬃcient incision process. In the absence of active choices of deformative rescalings, nonlinear scales
remain inaccessible, letting right hand side to vanish, the duality parameter λ being a pure constant of R, thus reducing to the
trivial case of classical smooth solution. However, the right hand
side may even vanish, approximately though, in a nontrivial manner, when, in particular, self dual asymptotics are realized by invoking identical choices of scaling parameters along the two dual
branches by Proposition 3.2 (see also Example of Sec 3.5). Further,
this process of extending the ground level asymptotic duality equation over higher order derivations could be iterated successfully to
generate higher order discontinuity equations. However, our main
interest here is to introduce asymptotic duality concepts for second
order ODE and its applications to nonlinear dynamics.
Step 5. Notice that the asymptotic duality Eqs. (38), (39) etc on
an appropriate function space exist, in fact, on the nonlinear neighbourhood structure of the continuum. Further, the nonlinear structures of smaller scales are accessed eﬃciently through cascades of
smaller scales of the form | log tn ± | (c.f. (23)) in the neighbourhood
of 1 (Proposition 3.2). The functional asymptotic duality displayed
in (38), (39) etc also indicate the fact that the asymptotic duality is also a universal property that could be realized in a function
space of differentiable functions C r (R, R ) in the vicinity of 1 in R.
However, the vicinity now is rich in nonlinear features involving C r
functions in a nontrivial manner, and can not simply be linear and
skiny as in conventional classical treatments.
Now, a function (mapping) f : R → R can be mapped universally to a (nontrivial) neighbourhood N1 ⊂ R∗ of 1 by the functional scaling: F (t ) = f (t )F (t  ), where the universal correction factor F lives nontrivially only in N1 ⊂ R∗ (we drop ± sign in anticipation of reﬂection symmetry). In other words, for a nontrivial
functional extension, F (t  ) must exist at least as a G (R ) function.
To emphasize, this scaling extension is realized in the vicinity of
every point t ∈ R, where the function is well deﬁned. Consequently,
the correction factor F is essentially a function of both t and t  ,
F = F (t , t  ), t ∈ R, t  ∈ N1 . In the following, we are, however,
working in the vicinity of a ﬁxed point t0 , and hence suppress the
t dependence of F . In later applications of Sec. 5.2 and 5.3, the
explicit t dependence are considered.
Next, we note that, the universality of the correction factor is
manifest only in form, in essence the intricate small scale dependence can, in fact, be decided by the global behaviour of the original function f , and more generally, by the function space C r . Notice that in ordinary R (that is, without asymptotic duality, inversion modes etc), the above factorization is trivial, since in that case
F (1 ) = f (1 ) and F (0 ) = 1. Notice also that above notations are
borrowed from those introduced in the context of R valued structure Eq. (37), that would next be extended on C r functions in the
following.
To delineate the small scale pattern in association with the
globally deﬁned function, we ﬁrst recall that the universal form
of the correction factor is deﬁned by the inﬁnite product representation of the nonclassical solution (23) of the scale invariant ODE, because the representation 1 ∈ R is extended in 1 ∈
R∗ through asymptotic duality factorization t− · t+ = λ, and hence
R = λ, since λ is nothing but the reﬂection symmetric, inﬁnite
product correction factors of (23) and/or the incision factor representation (30). The associated ground level (i.e. on R equipped with
nonlinear incremental modes) smaller nonlinear scales are realized
as deformed quadratic powers of the linear small scale η in R (in
ordinary sense), as explained in Sec. 3.1. Consequently, 1 ∈ R∗ is
not simply a singleton, but could, in fact, be modeled by a huge
set of nonlinear scales, represented not only by quadratic polynomials of the linear scale η but may be any general function of η,

nonlinear scales ηa , a = m/2, m an integer [c.f. Sec. 3.1]. For deﬁniteness, we are considering only integral order discontinuous solutions of Sec. 3.1 and 3.4, a > 2.
Step 4. Differentiating again, and recalling T− (1 ) = T+ (1 ) = 1,
we get the discontinuity equation

since t± = 1 ⇔ η = 0.
We remark here that (39) is the asymptotic duality version of
second derivative discontinuity considered in Sec. 3.1. As remarked
above, the parameter λ represents the self similar corrections in13

D.P. Datta

viz, η˜ = ψ (η ), ψ (0 ) = 0 and ψ ∈ C r (R, R ) (η˜ must inherit real analytic properties of η ∈ R, for instance, η must be increasing with
η). The ﬁrst sign of this generality is already noted in Sec. 3.4 in
connection with odd order derivative discontinuity of (16).
Now, in extending f ∈ C r (R, R ) self similarly over R∗ in the
neighbourhood N1 , the simplest choice for modeling the nonlinear
scales in the neighbourhood of a general point t0 ∈ R is facilitated
by the following observations and deﬁnitions: (i) the global definition of f : R → R has already exhausted the elements of linear
interval Nl1 := (1 − η, 1 + η ), t/t0 ∈ Nl1 in the ordinary real continuum R, (ii) Consequently, the nonlinear neighbourhood N1 of 1 in
R∗ could be represented as (1 − v(η ), 1 + v(η )) and hence one is
free to introduce the nonlinear variables depending explicitly on f
by ﬁrst writing

η˜  ≡ η˜ 1 = f˜(η ) = | f (1 + v(η )) − f (1 )| ≈ 0

ite nonlinear function involving the original function and ground
level deformation etc). As remarked already, the above deﬁnitions
of small scale variables and associated scaling parameters are the
simplest representative choices among many other possible choices
only. In this paper, we limit ourselves mainly to self similar extensions. Moreover, the implementation of nontrivial scaling at 2nd
level tells that the 2nd order ODEs would experience a discontinuity at the 3rd and above order only. For applications presented
in later sections, we also assume that once a nontrivial scaling is
included at the 2nd level of iteration, next nontrivial scaling is enacted at Mth level only, for a suﬃciently large M (c.f. Sec. (3.3)).
Further, identical scaling parameters are used along both dually
related branches, so that asymptotics concerned are self dual and
hence ﬁnitely differentiable (by Proposition 3.2). For a more general nonself-similar replication, the ansatz (40) could be replaced
by more general function ψ (η0 ) from the given function space. An
example is considered in Sec. 5.2.
The universal correction factor F (t˜ ) now has the universal
form following (23)

(40)

and then subsequently generating higher order smaller scales in
N0 following the recursion of Sec. 3.1. Here, v(η ) is the deformation scaling exponent of (4) on R. Further, it follows from the
deﬁnition, the variable η˜  is increasing in N0 . The above deﬁnition is justiﬁed by noting that f (t0 ) is a constant on R and hence
dF
= 0, t ∈ R, but admits nontrivial extensions on N1 when t ∈ R
dt
is replaced by a variable t˜ = ψ (t ), ψ (1 ) = 0 living nontrivially on
N1 , in virtue of reparametrization invariance of a R valued constant
[c.f. Remark 3.1, Sec. 3.4]. Further, the ansatz is dictated by the fact
that we are considering here a self similar replication of the global
function at the level of nonlinear scales.
Accordingly, f on N1 can be extended self similarly on the
ground (zeroth) level deformed variables η = v(η ) ∈ N0 ⊂ R∗ and
so η˜  is a composite of f˜ and v: η˜  = ( f˜ov )(η ). To construct the
next and higher level of deformations on the function space, one
invokes the ﬁrst nontrivial deformed scale at the 2nd level of iteration, leaving out the ﬁrst level, as η˜ 2 = α1 ( f˜(η1 ) − 1 /α1 ) and
etc, following the scale deﬁnitions utilized in deriving (23). For
functions respecting mean value theorem (i.e. for any C r function),
(40) could be simpliﬁed, whenever necessary, to a scaling variable
η˜ 1 ≈ f  (t0 )η . A remark is in order here.
Although deﬁnition (40) is meant to explore inﬁnitesimally
small nonlinear scales in N0 , the C r (R, R ) function f is not extended directly on inﬁnitesimal scales but through the the R valued valuation v(η ) in a self similar manner, as indicated above.
Consequently, the mean valued theorem can be accessed here as
ordinary R valued functions, avoiding technicalities of formal nonstandard analysis such as transfer principle, overspill and etc.
Next, recalling that the O(1) scale factor α1 must be introducing a mutilation in the functional values in the function space near
1 by transferring its action following a universal pattern, on inﬁnitesimal scales, a simplest choice again, that can be enacted in
the present function space modeling, is to set

α1 = 1 + 1 , 1 = f˜(η0 )

(42)

where t˜n = 1 + αn η˜ n , t˜ ∈ N1 , η˜  ∈ N0 (c.f. notations of (17)).
Clearly, F , by deﬁnition, solves again the scale invariant ODE (16),
but not in the ordinary linear variable t, but in a highly nonlinear deformed set of variables t˜n , denoted collectively as t˜f , as deﬁned here involving function space element f as well as the scaling ansatz of (17). The (time) variable t˜f here reduces to the ordinary real variable t ∈ R when scaling parameters involved are all
trivial. In general, t˜f (≡ t˜) (for simplicity), although solves the scale
invariant ODE (16), is highly nonlinear and so is called a fractal
variable (time). Borrowing the arguments in relation to the structure Eq. (37), we extend the structure equation on the C r function
space

having analogous interpretation, but have the potential to exhibit
more intricate nonlinear structures, compared to the R valued
structure equation, because of functional dependence of η˜  (on f )
and hence of t˜ . For completeness, we also observe here that the
asymptotic duality (2) deﬁned for the function space dependent
time variable t˜f would admit associated deformation scaling exponents v f ± (η˜  ) given symbolically as

(41)

such a dynamic deformation factor involving phase space variables
in the context of slow fast system is considered in a subsequent
section. In a linear problem (Theorem 5.2) one usually considers
σ f (t˜0 ) = t˜0 . We note here that the scaling exponent (44) is determined uniquely by the universal correction factor (42), by an equation of the form (33), and has the interpretation of ﬁnite size defects available in the ineﬃcient incision process generated by the
inﬁnite product representation of (42).
We collect the basic results on the construction of function
space dependent smaller scale structures in the form

corresponding to the zeroth level mutilation of the initial
small scale variable η˜  → η˜  = η˜  − i /(1 + i ), 1 = 0, 0 < η0 <<
η, η = v(η ) (refer to (23)) (zeroth order scale η is already taken
care of in the deﬁnition of f on R). The presence of two small
scale variables η and η0 would play the role of a delay mechanism,
and may be utilized to induce another level of nonlinearity in the
extension process. We remark here that in the present extended
framework a constant scaling parameter such as 1 need not be
a constant in the conventional (classical) sense. In fact, parameters like 1 are functions of slower nonlinear scales as indicated
here by the above deﬁnition (41). The choice of higher order scale
factors αn , n > 2 would involve further mutilations in the nonlinear neighborhood successively, based on what is implemented at
the ground level (notice that the small scale real variable η˜  is linear only at an apparent behaviourial level, actually it is a compos-

Here, t f ± = 1 ± η f , and N f 1 , N f 0 are replicas of N1 and N0 respectively, when the original real variable t± = 1 ± η of R is eliminated, by reparametrization invariance, in favour of a function space

Theorem 5.2. With above notations as deﬁned in relation to an IVP
of the linear ODE L(D ) f = 0, the universal form invariant correction
factor F on N f 1 can be obtained by directly integrating the equation relative to the ground level, asymptotically deformed time variable tR ≡ t  = 1 + η = 1 + vR (η ). The correction factor F also admits, by construction, an alternative inﬁnite product representation
given by (42) at an asymptotic time t f 0 , involving smaller nonlinear scale dependent time variable t f = t f /t f 0 , that resides in a functionally extended asymptotic neighbourhood of N f 1 and is completely
determined by the associated function space dependent deformation
scaling exponents v f ± and v f i± . The scaling exponent v f ± are represented by polynomials of degree m of the form

Clearly, this Proposition follows from (40) to (43) and also (44).
The ﬁnal part is a consequence of Proposition 3.2 in association
with (42) and (44).
Let us reemphasize again the importance of reparametrization
invariance.
The scaling extension of f considered above is trivial on R
since F / f = a, a constant. In view of the nontrivial class of gend

eralized solutions, the trivial equation log tf = 0 on R (t ∈ R ) extends nontrivially on R∗ , when the linear variable t is replaced
by a deformed variable t  living in R∗ . However, this replacement was achieved rather in the guise of invoking the nonlinear
incremental modes involving inversions and deformative rescalings as in Sec. 3.1. In the deﬁnitions of function space dependent
nonlinear scales above, we have, however, utilized explicitly the
reparametrization invariance of a real constant, in the form

because of involvement of only one scaling choice of the form 1 , as
the onset of a second choice is delayed for arbitrarily long time
Proof. For simplicity of notation, denote t f by t˜. Recall that f is
the unique classical solution of the given linear ODE in R. By construction, the universal correction factor solves the scale invariant
Eq. (16) self similarly over inﬁnity of scales generated by the function space variables t˜n = 1 ± η˜ n , n > 1 and has the universal form
given by (42). Recall that η˜  ≡ f˜(η ) and η = vR (η ), the scaling
exponent at the ground level R and η being the associated linear
variable in R.
Notice also that the correction factor F is determined uniquely
along both the dual branches because of reﬂection symmetry,
when by assumption, identical scaling hypothesizes are made use
of in its construction following Sec. 3.1. From (44) and (42), it also

follows that v f = log t˜F , t˜0 = 1 + η˜ 0 and hence by (1) (Proposition

Here, T± denote nontrivial corrections, that exist on N f 1 , to a
general function in the given function space. Since, we are concerned with a second order ODE, T± must have continuous second derivatives. Consequently, the parameter λ in the right hand

Once the universal small scale properties of the correction factors in the function space C r (R, R ) are ascertained, we return to our
prime goal to extend asymptotic duality over generalized higher
order derivations in the fashion of (38). The process of such extensions work universally again, as we verify below explicitly for 2nd
order linear ODE.

Recall now that η˜ 0 = f˜(η ) = f˜(v(η )), so that F is completely
determined by v f . But v f is actually nothing but, in fact, equals
f ovR , and hence solves the given linear ODE in the variable vR (η ).

ground level smaller variable η → μη, the second order duality
relation (45) is obtained. Noticing that a constant scale factor μ is
immaterial in the present extension (the renormalied scaling exponent being independent of such a factor), we set, without any loss
of generality, μ = 1.
Step 7. It turns out that a linear (second order, say)
ODE L(D ) f = 0 in R then uniquely factorizes as (L(D− ) ·
L(D+ ))( f− · f+ ) = 0 ⇒ (L(D− ) f− ) · (L(D+ ) f+ ) = 0 ⇒ L(D− )− = 0
and L(D+ )+ = 0, because of linear independence of the argument
asymptotic variables t f − , t f + respectively in N f 1 . The functions ±
correspond to the nontrivial corrections along both the branches
accessing nonlinear asymptotic scales as modeled in Step 5. For
deﬁniteness, we implement identical choices regarding the rescaling parameters along both the dually related branches of the given
ODE. This assumption should be suﬃcient for the presentation of
this paper. More general possiblity will be considered separately.
The following Theorem now states clearly the relationship between
the given linear ODE and the associated correction factor, that is
known to satisfy universally the scale invariant ODE (16) in a time

t ∈ R is now replaced by the dynamical variable t˜ ∈ R∗ represented
by a generalized solution of scale invariant Eq. (16) and the function space elements. An ordinary (linear) differential equation in R
is now extended over R∗ as an inﬁnite cascade of self similar ODEs
over smaller nonlinear scales living in the function space C r (R, R )
as represented by (40) and (41). The scale invariance of the higher
order equation L(D ) f = 0 on N f 1 is already manifest the way it is
deduced following functional asymptotic duality above. As an explicit example we construct a generalized solution of the harmonic
oscillator equation.

differentiable duality principle. However, even with this simple assumption, one encounters nonclassical possibilities in the late evolution. In a more general framework, scaling choices need not be
based simply on the basic system variable x, but more generally
on a nonlinear function of system variables viz, g(x, x , . . . ) admitting continuous 2nd derivatives. In that case v would be a general function of displaced variables of the form x˜(η0 ), x˜ (η0 ), . . .
[(46), Theorem 5.2], that may behave as constant scaling parameters, as evidenced in the example of harmonic oscillation, at the
order η ∼ 1 only. However, noticing the role of η0 as a relative inﬁnitesimal compared to η, x˜(η0 ) may be assumed to imitate a nonlinear function of x˜(η ), x˜(η0 ) ≈ h(x˜(η ), x˜ (η )), that may become
functionally active when η ∼ m > 1.
Consequently, if the original linear system is allowed to evolve
over longer and longer time scales η ∼ m, say, corresponding to
the linear small scale variable η = | log  n t |(∼ 1 ) for t ∼ e −n , the
linear oscillation of (47) would realize itself as a global nonlinear
oscillation, because of the intricate nonlinear dependence of the
argument variable v f = g(x, x ) = g(η ), that would be activated in
that longer time scale. Indeed, noticing dv f = g dη etc, one may
rewrite (47) as

The classical solution is thus extended in R∗ as X (t , t  ) =
x(t )Xc (t  ) = cos t (1 + κ cos v(η1 )). However, for a differentiable
asymptotic exponent v, that is invoked here, the simplest self similar extension of the cosine wave in R∗ , is essentially determined
by very ﬁrst choice of the scaling parameter 1 , so that scaling
exponent has the form v = σ1 η , σ1 ≈ 21 (from eq.(29)). Consequently, the nonlinear variable t  simpliﬁes to t  = 1 + σ1 η , where
σ1 is generally an irrational number. As a consequent, the original harmonic oscillation, after a suﬃcient long duration of unperturbed oscillation, may encounter slow intrinsic divergence to a
quasi-periodic oscillation, that could be realized at O(1) scale when
the dominant factor is scaled out, so as to zooming into the neighbourhood of 1 deeper.

damping given by gg and nonlinear rigidity g and possibly forcing, for an appropriate scaling choice g. The nonlinear damping and
rigidity here are not artifacts of so called extrinsic physical (Newtonian) modeling, but are unfolded, over a suﬃciently longer time
scale (η ∼ m >> 1), from the original linear system, deﬁned on an
(relative) inﬁnitesimal scale, and designed by an intrinsic modeling, so to speak, when inﬁnitesimal nonlinear scales, in turn, are
modeled based on some ‘mathematical intuition’ as introduced and
explained here.
As an explicit example, one may design the functional scaling
parameter 1 , in (41), in such a manner that the function g assumes the special form satisfying g ≈ 12 (T 2 − 1 )T  and g ≈ k, a
constant. In that case (49) resembles a Van der Pol Oscillator. The
functional constraints on g are consistently satisﬁed for η ∼ O(m ),

since one may verify that g ≈ k +
g dη ∼ k + o(1 ), when η
varies in an interval (m − δ, m + δ ), δ > 0 and g continuous.
The main observation of this section can be summed up as
follows: A linear (smooth) microscopic (inﬁnitesimal) structure (linear ODE here) has the potential to unfold itself into a future globally available (realizable) nonlinear structure (a nonlinear ODE) by a
choice based activation of seed dynamic possibilities lying dormant
in the original inﬁnitesimal structure. Further, a dynamical system
is likely to possess more dynamic possibilities compared to conventional approach. We have already encountered that a linear
wave over a suﬃciently long time scale may evolve into linear
but quasiperiodic wave, that may further bifurcate into a nonlinear periodic or non-periodic (chaotic) waves on another generation of time scales, and this process of unfolding is actually unending, because newer possibilities are still lying unexplored in deeper
nonlinear smaller scales that could be activated in far more longer
time scales.
In the next section we investigate another, more practical aspect of these hidden possibilities, that may be utilized in eﬃcient
computations of various nonlinear periodic orbits, improving conventional computational techniques [23].

This simple example reveals once more the novel feature of an
active system participation, to determine afresh its (system’s own
global dynamic behaviour) the future evolutionary track. We state
this observation as a dynamical principle:
One may invoke the principle of right choice, so to speak, in the
context of dynamical system, viz., a dynamical system is endowed
with a special faculty of intuitionto determine/adjust right choices of
scaling parameters acting in N1 cooperatively with inversions towards
a new, nonclassical evolutionary track other than the uniquely determined one, that the system is supposed to evolve. The late time evolution of a classical (linear) system modeled in R is generally deterministic and unique. In the extended framework of R∗ equipped
with generalized class of solutions, the classical scenario is altered.
Future evolution of a system is really ‘indeterminate’ and ‘open’, as
in the Intuitionist mathematics [10]. This is yet another realization
of the local - global principle in this extended scenario.
5.2. Linear to nonlinear
Invoking more complex deformation scaling exponents involving more nontrivial nilpotent terms in the polynomial representation of (1), one can immediately realize that apparent innocuous
form of a linear wave Eq. (47) in fact hides a spectrum of nonlinear oscillatory models. Let us recall that the universal form invariance of self similar correction factors in the solution space of
a system could be simpliﬁed in the form of the nilpotent polynomial (1) representations of the scaling exponents involving system
phase space variables in a highly nonlinear manner, as explained
above. In the example of harmonic oscillator, we consider simplest
self similar extension dictated by scaling choices concomitant with

In the limit η → 0, the faster variable t is eliminated, and so one
is ideally exploring the nonclassical (function space dependent)
neighbourhood N1 (or N0 ).
Let us recall that, the zeroth order approximation, though yields
a qualitatively correct result for the asymptotic state, in fact, fails
to produce a higher precision results [3,12]. To circumvent the
problem we now present an improvement of the initial approximation (52) by detailing a computational scheme to ﬁnding a
correction term in N1 exploiting nonclassical, asymptotic duality supported scales. To this effect, let x(t ) be the exact solution of (50) in R. Then the system (50) extends in R∗ , as t and
x are respectively extended, for deﬁniteness, to t → T = t σtv (η ) =

of deformed nonlinear modes, a linear differential system is allowed to explore novel nonclassical asymptotic trajectories such
as having higher order nonsmooth behaviours, periodic to quasiperiodic transition and so on. In an appropriate asymptotic setting,
a linear system may also have the potential to transit to an explicit
nonlinear system.
On this background, one naturally expects much more radical
possibilities when the initial system is already a nonlinear ODE
(nODE). Here, we deal with a speciﬁc class of planner nonlinear
oscillations driven by external periodic forcing. We show that such
a system would replicate self similarly over nontrivial deformed
scales in N1 ⊂ R∗ , in an approximate sense, that will be detailed
below. These smaller scale approximate self similar replicates of
original nODE would allow one to formulate nontrivial computational schemes for very eﬃcient estimations of periodic orbits
[12], thus improving conventional nonlinear methods in literature
[23].
As an explicit example enumerating the general scheme, let us
consider here driven planner systems of the form

Notice that above extension of dynamical variables T and X are facilitated by speciﬁc choices of dynamical deformation factors (exponents) ψt and ψx respectively. In case one makes a choice of
the form ψx (t ) ∝ |xx˙ |t log t −1 , then the correction would have been
x(t, τ ) = x(t )(1 + ξ˜ (τ )), corresponding to self similar extensions
considered in Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 5.2. We, however, continue to work with the ﬁrst choice, since such multiple choices
are indeed allowed in the framework of asymptotic duality. One
is indeed free to invoke most appropriate dynamical choices in
a particular problem so as to arrive at a desired destination. An
intriguing example of these possible multiplicity of choices is already encountered in the construction of generalized class of nontrivial solutions from the scale invariant linear Eq. (16), by extending the original linear equation self similarly over nonclassical
scales. A parallel development of self similar extensions of a nODE
is demonstrated below.
Now to simplify the deformed Eq. (55) in N1 , we ﬁrst assume
that the correction term ξ (t, τ ) and its derivatives are suﬃciently

The above class of nonlinear oscillators is generally known as the
generalized Lienard systems, Rayleigh and Van der Pol oscillators
being particular examples [23]. It is well known that such a system
admits isolated (stable) periodic orbits, called limit cycles, and depending on the forcing amplitude k > 0, such a periodic orbit undergoes period doubling bifurcations, leading to chaos. In this paper, we limit our investigations to period 1 cycles and address the
problem of eﬃcient computation of these cycles. For deﬁniteness,
let us assume that the amplitude of the cycle be max |x(t )| = a,
where maximum is evaluated over a period. To this effect, let us
recall that conventional nonpertubative methods such as Multiple
Scale Analysis [23] or Renormalization Group Methods [24] etc can
predict correct qualitative aspects of a limit cycle with approximate determination of orbits and other phase space variables such
as amplitude, phase etc. An approximate (zeroth level) solution of

Our aim now is to determine an approximate replica of the original Lienard like system in a smaller nonlinear scale in the asymptotic neighbourhood N1 . To this effect, we work in the framework
of asymptotic duality, Sec. 2.2, and assume, as before, that the ordinary real time t is replaced by a suitably chosen self dual deformed time t → v(η ) by the deﬁnitions (2) and (4) in N1 . The
nontrivial neighbourhood N1 is modeled here as t = t0 (1 ± η ), so
that η → v(η ) ∈ N0 for a suﬃciently large t0 , so as to ensure an
initial orbit of (50) to settle on an asymptotic state, viz, a single
stable period limit cycle determined approximately by (52) with
an accuracy O( ). Consequently, even as the faster variable η → 0,
the slower variable 0 < v(η ) < 1 remains ﬁnitely available to the
system for ﬁner enhanced computations of the asymptotic orbit.

1. Self dual asymptotics (Sec. 2.2 and 3.5) are realized as
T± (t )/t = λ± t ∓v(η ) , where v+ (η ) = v− (η ) and λ± are constants, so
that T− (t )T+ (t ) = λt 2 , and λ = λ− λ+ , a constant. In the class G (R )

generalized constant, which would contribute successively higher
order correction factors depending on appropriate nonlinear deformed smaller scales in the initial estimate. Further, asymptotic
functions T± and v± are continuously ﬁrst order differentiable,
G ⊂ C1 .
Critically Self Dual Asymptotics
To extend the self dual asymptotics to general non self dual
cases, we ﬁrst notice that the corresponding extensions can
not be an element of C 1 (R, R ), one must consider instead the
space of continuous functions C 0 (R, R ) only. Recalling the extensions considered in Sec. 2.2 (Item. 4), a general pair of
asymptotics must respect the relations T± (t )/t = λ± t ∓v(η ) and
T− (t )T+ (t ) = λt 2 , and λ = λ− λ+ , where the proportionality parameters λ− , λ+ , λ are not constant, but are slowly varying functions
of smaller scales of the asymptotic variable t respectively.
For weakly self dual case, viz, when v− (η ) = αv+ (η ), α > 0,
the parameters λ± are assumed to be slowly varying of the form
λ± = K | log t |k± (1 + u ) where u is a function slower than the ﬁrst
logarithmic factor, so that at the ﬁrst order scale, u may be assumed to be constant, and K > 0 and k± are also constants relative to the scales concerned, with, however, possible dependence
on higher order scales. It follows, therefore, from (2) and (4), that
the general form of the weakly self dual deformation exponents
are given as (8)

where a1 (η ) = 2 A+ A− e−p1 (η )τ /2 and μ = | p1 (η )2 − 4 p2 (η )|.
The corrected solution of (55) now has the form

X (t ) = x(t ) + ξ (η, τ ) = a0 cos ( (1 + σ0 σ˜ (σ0 ) )t + γ0 )
+a1 (η ) cos (v˙ μ(η )η + γ1 )

(66)

which follows from Proposition 3.2 and where vi± = (σi± η +
O(η2 )) log ti and for self dual case σi− = σi+ .
2. Consequently, at the ﬁrst order level T± (t )/t has the repre-

(65)

where the correction amplitude a1 (η ) is ﬁxed by max |X (t )| = a.
We notice that as t and η varies over a complete period, the exponential factor in the correction amplitude a1 remains bounded.
Further, the amplitude a1 and phase γ1 are available as free parameters (since A± are arbitrary), that could be adjusted appropriately
to yield a higher precision estimate of the original periodic orbit.
An analogous estimation of 1-cycles of Raleigh - Van der Pol oscillators were reported previously [3]. The present analysis may be
considered to be a rigorous justiﬁcation of the same.
Next, it follows from the Theorem 5.2 the exact solution (64) of
the linear PDE (60) admits self similar extensions on successive
higher order deformed scales scales η˜ 2 , η˜ 4 and so on. The corresponding corrected solution of (50) and/or (55), however, involves
a number of adjustable parameters ai , γi , i = 1, 2, . . . (m corrected
terms include 2m adjustable parameters), which can be utilized efﬁciently to compute an extremely accurate orbit. The present form
of the corrected solution involving m + 1 terms arising self similarly from nonlinear deformed scales resembles closely the solution obtained by Luo [12] by generalized averaging method for
higher precision calculations of periodic orbits. However, our results differ clearly from that of Luo’s in a signiﬁcant way not only
in derivation but also in interpretation and scope.
We remark ﬁnally that an approximate nonperturbative computation of a periodic orbit of a nonlinear oscillation could be performed to any desired level of accuracy by mapping the original
nODE into a cascade of self similar linear PDEs which exist nontrivially on the cascade of corresponding deformed nonlinear scales,
supported by the asymptotic duality structure. Moreover, this observation should also be valid not only in nonlinear oscillations but
also to any general dynamical system.

so that corresponding critically self dual asymptotics have the

Clearly, critically self dual asymptotics as derived above mimics exactly the Prime Number Theorem [13], when we identify the conjugate self dual asymptotics T− and T+ respectively with the prime
counting function (n ) and the nth prime number P (n ), for a sufﬁciently large n when the initial asymptotic variable t plays the
roll of the natural number sequence n. As the variable n assumes
larger and larger values from the set of positive integers, asymptotic duality constructions allow it to bifurcate into two unique
pair of conjugate asymptotic functions (n ) and P (n ) those are
critically self dual to each other having unique deformation exponent (68), denoted v p := v˜ , henceforth. Accordingly, the conjugates
(n ) and P (n ), being critically self dual, must, therefore, respect the
prime number theorem. Besides this critical bifurcation, an asymptotic n may also experience other more general weakly or strictly
dual bifurcations when the conjugate functions would belong to

5.4. Extension to nonsmooth duality structures
So far we have studied some special features and applications
of self dual asymptotics and associated scaling exponents in the
framework of the extended solution space G (R ) of the scale invariant ODE (16). Self dual asymptotics represent only a small class
of possible extensions of R, corresponding to, what may be identiﬁed as, a smooth, more precisely, differentiable extensions. Since all
the allowed extensions are, nevertheless, nonclassical, the differentiable extensions considered above are also nonclassical because
of loss of higher order classical smoothness properties and associated intrinsic indeterminacy. Here, we consider a particular example of more general extensions corresponding to non-self dual
asymptotics, viz, the critically self dual asymptotics and associated
correction terms. We show that such asymptotics generally belong
18

D.P. Datta

Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 152 (2021) 111457

more general class of arithmetical functions of analytic number
theory [13].
Consequently, we conclude that critically self dual asymptotics
as realized above in the space of continuous functions C 0 naturally
provides an easy constructive demonstration of the Prime number
theorem. Next, we determine the nature of correction term in the
above form of the prime number theorem.
Correction Term
|T −T |
Let Rc = −T 0 where T0 = logt t be the relative correction to the
0
prime counting function. First, we remark that the correction of
a critically self dual asymptotic case must also be critically self
dual, given that Rc → 0. Next, this criticality of correction term,
may now arise, in general, from non self dual asymptotics, either
(i) from the weakly self dual situation (8), (67) in the critical limit
as above, or (ii) from strictly dual asymptotics v− v+ = μ respecting
(9) (c.f. item 4, Sec. 2.2), viz,

v+ (η )2 − κv+ (η ) − μ = o(1 )

needs further rigorous justiﬁcations and proofs by specialized
number theorists.

6. Conclusion: summary of results and future scope
We have presented signiﬁcantly new analytic results having
important applications in asymptotic states of a dynamical system. The concepts of asymptotic duality transformations acting on
Cauchy null or divergent sequences of ordinary real continuum
are explained. A Cauchy null sequence, for instance, is awarded
a ﬁnite renormalized value, called a deformation scaling exponent
v(η ) > 0 that happens to be a constant relative to the original null
sequence (variable), but may depend on slowly varying nonlinear
scales, those are generally become available in a nonlinear system.
A realization of such duality transformations involving a cascade
of localized rescaling and inversions in a context of a scale invariant ﬁrst order linear system is shown to deform the classical
smooth solution space into a second or higher derivative discontinuous (nonsmooth) generalized solution space. The original linear
system is shown to proliferate into a system of self similar scale
invariant equations over an inﬁnite sequence of deformed nonlinear scales. The new generalized solutions are shown to enjoy two
fold indeterminacy: the one inherited from the inﬁnite sequence
of localized scaling parameters which generally remain indeterminate except for some nilpotency conditions (in the sense of Intuitionistic mathematics and/or Fermat’s real formalism). The next
level of indeterminacy arises from the nonlinear inversive modes
that overestimate the classical smooth solution by a magnitude of
O(η2 ), |η| << 1. A generalized solution is interpreted geometrically as an incision (elimination) process that is supposed to cancel the initial overestimated amount successively as the number
of iteration goes to inﬁnity. However, in reality the incision process turns out to be an ineﬃcient process leaving out an irreducible defect at each level. The reason of this ineﬃciency is linked
to the loss of higher derivative smoothness, since the associated
defect plays the role of a measure to the higher order derivative
discontinuity. Interestingly, this defect also determines the degree
of intrinsic uncertainty that remains in the new solution. The indeterminism that enters in classical mechanics through this class
of generalized solutions is interpreted as a generic principle of
mechanics and parallels Intuitionist mathematics interpretation of
[14,15]. The higher order nonsmoothness of scale invariant linear
systems also offer an existence proof of the nontrivial deformation
scaling exponents in the class of generalized solutions. The scaling exponents realized in the context of scale invariant linear systems are self dual and also ﬁnitely differentiable. We next extend
the class of self dual asymptotics and associated deformation exponents on the space of differentiable functions. A general differentiable function is extended self similarly over nonlinear scales,
determined self consistently by the function space itself, when the
correction factors are shown to respect universally the scale invariant linear system. As applications of this function space theoretic
constructions, we ﬁrst extend the formalism to higher order linear ODEs and then to second order nonlinear systems. We show,
in particular, that a nonlinear oscillation problem can be mapped
to a self similar system of linear ODEs, which can be integrated
exactly to yield very eﬃcient computation of periodic orbits of the
original oscillatory problem. In short, the presented formalism reveals a new linear-nonlinear duality relationship in the space of
differential equations. Interpretations of these results in the context of living intelligent systems and intuitionistic mathematics are
presented. A dynamical system is endowed here with a special inbuilt mechanism to invoke intelligently designed asymptotic duality
transformations, so as to evolve into nonclassical evolutionary trajectories, not available in conventional classical setting.

and the error estimates of de la Vallee Poussin that could give a
rigorous justiﬁcation for best value of A = 1 (Ref. eq. (5), pages 8487 of [13]). In Lemma B.2 (Appendix B), the best value A = 1 is
interpreted as a weak criticality limit. It is also established that
the higher correction terms (70) fails to improve the PNT estimate
in any reasonable sense [13], and so we disregard this correction
Cw from further consideration.
(ii) Consequently, the nontrivial error now can be derived
uniquely from the only available critical self dual correction aris√
ing from the strictly dual asymptotics in the form vc = μ from
(69). Extending the self similar corrections (66) of the smooth (differentiable) asymptotics on critically nonsmooth case in the form

where vc = μ = t −1/2 log t is the nontrivial correction in the critical deformation exponent v p , eq.(68), entering in the estimate from
strictly dual class of asymptotics in the above critical limit. One
thus arrives ﬁnally at the tighter bound |Rc | ≤ vc = t −1/2 (log t )2 .
This bound is obtained minimally from all the allowed criticality limits from both weakly and strictly dual asymptotics in the class of
continuous functions C 0 . Clearly, the obtained bound match exactly
with the tightest known bound from Riemann hypothesis [13].
To conclude, the critically self dual asymptotics corresponding
to an asymptotically large natural number n corresponds to the
prime number theorem with correct error bounds respecting Riemann hypothesis. To the author’s view, this is a very promising
new route to the problems related to Riemann hypothesis. The
present semi-formal analysis of this important topic, of course,

Finally, we present an extension of self dual asymptotics to
critically self dual asymptotics in the class of continuous functions. Critical self dual asymptotics are found to relate universally
to the asymptotics relevant for prime counting function and the
nth prime and hence to the Prime Number Theorem. The associated critical correction term also gives the correct error bound
respecting the Riemann hypothesis. True signiﬁcance of these observations in the context of Riemann’s hypothesis requires more in
depth analysis by number theory experts in future.
The results presented here have the potential of a number of future extensions and applications. The extension of asymptotic duality structure on more general spaces involving weakly self dual and
more general (non-self) dual asymptotics is left for future publications. Weakly self dual asymptotics seem to have important applications in period doubling and other type of more general bifurcation problems in nonlinear systems. The strictly dual asymptotics
seem to be relevant for fractal and multifractal function spaces
[1,2]. More serious applications to number theory are also very
welcome.

This study explores how belief systems—free will, fatalistic determinism, and scientific deter­
minism—are associated with individuals’ intentions to engage in protest, focusing on the context
of the 2023 earthquakes in Southeastern Türkiye. These earthquakes, with magnitudes of 7.8 and
7.5, caused severe damage and loss of life, exacerbated by issues of corruption and neglect.
Drawing on collective action research, the study examines how anger and participative efficacy
beliefs are linked to these belief systems and their potential role in protest intentions. The findings
suggest that individuals who endorse fatalistic determinism report lower protest intentions, with
anger playing a mediating role in this relationship. Scientific determinism shows a weak asso­
ciation with higher protest intentions, mediated by anger. Belief in free will is associated with
increased protest intentions, partially through participative efficacy beliefs. The case of Türkiye,
with its socio-political context and the large-scale devastation following the earthquakes, pro­
vides a meaningful backdrop for understanding how belief systems may shape protest motiva­
tions. These results offer insights into the different emotional and cognitive processes that link
belief systems to protest intentions in crisis situations.

Corruption, in the form of influencing inspection processes through bribery, stands as one of the primary underlying factors
responsible for earthquake-related catastrophes, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions across the globe [1]. While in­
dividuals can show solidarity and help victims of earthquakes [2], they can also join protests following disasters to challenge au­
thorities [3]. Exploring the motivators behind participating in anti-corruption protests, actions intended to punish corrupt targets for
their immoral behavior, after disasters in the form of collective action is crucial. Protests can act as a deterrent to future wrongdoing by
holding current wrongdoers accountable. Public protests against corrupt individuals can set an example and discourage future
transgressions. However, the reasons why some individuals are motivated to protest in unjust situations while others are not require
more investigation.
This study focuses on the devastating earthquakes that struck Southeastern Türkiye in February 2023, which registered magnitudes
of 7.8 and 7.5 and caused nearly 60,000 fatalities [4]. These disasters resulted in significant loss of life and extensive damage to
infrastructure, exacerbated by longstanding issues of corruption and neglect that have plagued the region [5]. Türkiye has a rich
history of collective action, with protests emerging in response to both political and social grievances [6,7]. This positions Türkiye as a
valuable case for examining protest intentions, as the socio-political landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of public
discontent, historical grievances against authorities, and a heightened awareness of corruption in the wake of such tragedies. By
exploring the motivations behind protest participation in this specific context, the study aims to shed light on how belief systems relate

to individuals’ intentions to engage in protest. This exploration is particularly relevant in Türkiye, where public dissatisfaction with the
authorities following the disaster has played a crucial role in demanding accountability and reform through protests on social media
and marches in the streets [8]. Understanding these dynamics not only contributes to the existing literature on collective action and
belief systems but also offers insights into the broader implications for civic engagement in response to governmental shortcomings
during crises.
One factor that could determine participation in protest actions is the type of beliefs individuals hold—such as fatalistic deter­
minism, scientific determinism, or free will. While fatalistic determinism could contribute to reduced protest action intentions, sci­
entific determinism and free will can contribute to increased participation. However, the role of these beliefs in predicting protest
action participation intentions has not been studied before. Thus, the main aim of this current paper is to investigate whether
deterministic and free will beliefs are related to protest action intentions. The second aim is to explore how these beliefs relate to
protest action intentions by examining the mediating roles of anger and participative efficacy beliefs, stemming from the collective
action literature. In an exploratory fashion, this study aims to integrate the three belief types and the proposed collective action
predictors of anger and participative efficacy beliefs to create and test a comprehensive model of protest action intentions.
1. Free will, fatalistic, and scientific determinism
In this study, three key concepts are investigated: fatalistic determinism, scientific determinism, and free will. Carey and Paulhus
[9] conceptualized that fatalistic determinism refers to the belief that outcomes in life are predestined and inevitable, largely
controlled by external forces such as fate, destiny, or divine will, leaving little room for human agency or intervention. Those who hold
fatalistic beliefs often feel powerless in shaping their own futures, which may reduce their motivation to engage in collective actions
aimed at social change. Conversely, Carey and Paulhus [9] framed scientific determinism as it is rooted in the belief that human
behavior and societal events are governed by natural laws, such as biological or physical forces, that can be understood and predicted.
Even though both fatalistic and scientific determinism suggest that life is determined by extrinsic forces, the attribution of those
sources differs significantly.
The concept of free will stands in contrast to both forms of determinism. Free will refers to the belief that individuals have the
capacity to make autonomous decisions that are not entirely constrained by external forces or predetermination [9,10]. The belief in
one’s own capacity can be critical when considering engagement in protest behavior. Theoretical discussions surround the conse­
quences of undermining free will, with differing perspectives on whether it has positive or negative effects on moral actions [11,12].
Furthermore, empirical evidence on the relative effectiveness of these viewpoints remains inconclusive.
Existing empirical research on free will, fatalistic, and scientific determinism, and their connections to protest behavior is scarce.
However, by examining studies on immoral behavior, we can identify potential relationships between these beliefs and protest be­
haviors against corruption.
Individuals who subscribe to the concept of free will are typically inclined to take action in order to effect change in the world. In
contrast, deterministic beliefs may deter proactive measures, as they assert that everything lies beyond personal control. Determinism
can serve as a rationalization for engaging in immoral actions [9]. Research has demonstrated that belief in free will can discourage
engagement in undesirable behavior, while determinism can serve as a motivator [13]. For instance, research showed that priming
anti-free will beliefs increases anti-social behavior of ethnic prejudice while priming pro-free will beliefs improves outgroup attitudes
[14]. Another set of experiments indicated that promoting disbelief in free will diminishes willingness to help others and increases
tendencies towards aggression [15]. Research also showed that free will predicts prescribed punishment [16].
Additional research has uncovered a connection between belief in free will and a tendency to advocate harsher punishments for
immoral conduct, although the impact was context-dependent. For instance, a study by Martin and colleagues [17] analyzed data from
the World Values Survey encompassing 46 countries and revealed that belief in free will was associated with increased support for
criminal punishment. They also noted that free will beliefs led to greater intolerance toward unethical behaviors, but this effect was
surprisingly evident solely in countries with moderate to high levels of institutional integrity, which refers to the level of transparency
and corruption-free governance within a country’s public sector. This suggests that in societies where public institutions are perceived
as transparent and free from corruption, belief in free will may amplify a sense of individual accountability, leading to greater
endorsement of punitive measures. Conversely, in societies with lower institutional integrity, the perceived ineffectiveness of the
justice system might dampen the influence of free will beliefs on punitive attitudes. Thus, strong societal norms and just institutions are
essential for shaping attitudes toward rule violations, which have broader implications for policy-making and cultural progress [18].
As mentioned above, the evidence of the connection between free will and moral behavior is clear, but no prior research investigated
its relation with anti-corruption action participation.
Prior research compared the differential effects of free will and determinism on immoral behavior. In their highly cited and debated
work consisting of two experiments, Vohs and Schooler [19] showed that endorsing deterministic messages increased participants’
cheating on tasks (via reduced free will) while endorsing free will did not. However, subsequent studies failed to replicate the findings
of Vohs and Schooler [19] on cheating [20]. A recent meta-analysis concluded that manipulating anti-free will beliefs increases
determinism beliefs and reduces free will, but those changes do not relate to any attitudinal, cognitive, or behavioral outcomes [13].
More research is needed to shed more light on these differentiated findings of the roles of free will and determinism in moral behavioral
outcomes. Examining different types of determinism while controlling free will in novel contexts can contribute to the debate about
which types of beliefs are related to the punishment of immoral behavior.
The current research suggests that believing in fatalistic determinism could have harmful consequences, as it may discourage
protesting against corrupt targets who are responsible for losses. Those who believe in fatalistic determinism are more likely to adhere
2

to extrinsic moral values suggested by certain worldviews or religions, rather than their own personal moral values [9]. Fatalistic
determinism, especially among Muslims, may have a stronger association with religiosity [21]. In a study conducted in Türkiye, Yilmaz
and colleagues (2018) showed that fatalistic determinism was positively and statistically significantly related to religiosity, whereas
scientific determinism showed no statistically significant relationship with religiosity. Furthermore, they found that free will was not
significantly related to religiosity. Stemming from the evidence of the closer connection between religiosity and fatalistic determinism,
rather than attributing human negligence caused by corruption, individuals who subscribe to fatalistic determinism may accept
irresponsible targets by attributing the issue to uncontrollable external forces.
Scientific determinism proposes that the future is determined by environmental and biological factors [22]. The current research
suggests that individuals who hold scientific deterministic beliefs are likely to acknowledge the risks linked with disasters and take
scientific warnings seriously. Conversely, individuals who reject scientific determinism can be more prone to deny predicted catas­
trophes and attribute resulting fatalities to fate, rather than corrupt human actions. Therefore, it is expected that beliefs in scientific
determinism will motivate protest action. Similarly, belief in free will can also be a strong motivator of protest action intentions. The
more people believe they can create change through their actions, the more likely they are to take action. In the context of protesting
corruption, it is expected that those believing in free will show a greater willingness to protest. Since scientific determinism is closely
linked to rational action, the extent to which individuals are willing to protest may be constrained by the strength of a country’s
institutions and its cultural attitudes toward corruption [18].
Based on the studies discussed, certain patterns can be anticipated in how these beliefs are likely to influence individuals’ intentions
to engage in protest actions. While both forms of determinism imply limits to free will, they differ in their implications for protest
action. Fatalistic determinism, by reducing perceived agency, is likely to decrease engagement in protest behavior. Scientific deter­
minism, on the other hand, suggests that systemic change is possible through understanding and manipulating the mechanisms
governing human behavior. As such, it could lead to a greater likelihood of participating in protests aimed at social reform. In contrast,
those who hold strong beliefs in free will may be more likely to engage in protests, as they perceive their actions as capable of directly
influencing societal outcomes. This distinction between determinism and free will is central to the focus of this study on how these
beliefs relate to individuals’ willingness to engage in protest action.
2. Two mediating processes: anger and participative efficacy beliefs
The literature concerning laypeople’s beliefs and the factors influencing engagement in protests has traditionally been examined in
isolation. Nevertheless, it is possible to merge these two bodies of literature by regarding the beliefs of laypeople as drivers of the
factors associated with participating in protest action. While several drivers of collective action, such as anger and efficacy beliefs, have
been extensively examined [23,24], the underlying beliefs shaping these motivators have not been explored within the framework of
free will and determinism. These underlying beliefs have the potential to influence the degree to which anger and participative efficacy
beliefs are experienced.
Stemming from the collective action literature, participative efficacy beliefs, the contributions of individual members to the col­
lective effort in achieving group goals, can serve as a focal mediating mechanism in the associations between deterministic and free
will beliefs and protest action intentions. Although connected, belief in free will and efficacy beliefs are different constructs [13]. While
efficacy beliefs refer to general assessments of the individual’s abilities and skills [25], free will is an attitudinal orientation that
encompasses a broader belief in the freedom to choose [26]. In collective action research, participative efficacy bridges personal and
ingroup agency, acting as a potent motivator [27]. Research has shown that participative efficacy beliefs are core predictors of col­
lective action [23,28,29]. According to this view, individuals make a cost-benefit calculation before participating in protest action
[30–32]. In other words, people can conduct various assessments regarding the cost and benefit factors associated with their group’s
potential, and this variety may be associated with their beliefs about free will and determinism.
Anger, a key outcome emotion stemming from injustices, can also motivate people to participate in collective action [33].
Stemming from relative deprivation theory, when individuals make comparisons of their group with others, they can realize the
disadvantaged situation of their groups compared to others [34–36]. As one of the strongest fuels for motivated action [37], feelings of
anger, can be experienced at the group level and lead to protest action [38]. In the context of mass destruction exacerbated by cor­
ruption after disaster, survivors can feel angry about losses especially when they compare their situation with those of communities
living in similarly seismically active regions that remain unaffected by such destruction. For example, major earthquakes shake many
areas in Japan constantly. However, most of the time (except during the Fukushima incident), these major shakes do not cause sig­
nificant damage due to well-prepared buildings and strictly followed construction rules [39]. It can be expected that believers in
fatalistic determinism will feel less anger toward the corrupt targets who did not build resistant buildings because they can attribute
fate as the responsibility, not human negligence. On the other hand, individuals who believe in scientific determinism may feel more
outraged about the losses after disasters because those losses could have been prevented if people listened to experts and diligently
followed regulations.
3. The present study
The socio-political context of Türkiye is particularly relevant for examining how corruption contributes to protests. According to
the World Bank’s Corruption Perceptions Index, Türkiye’s ranking has dramatically worsened from 52nd in 2012 to 115th in 2023
([40], March 21). This decline highlights a systemic issue within the country. Historical records indicate that corrupt municipalities
have granted approval for substandard construction, allowing unsafe buildings to flourish. Following the 1999 earthquake,
3

construction amnesties further legitimized the occupation of these hazardous structures (Green, 2005).
Unfortunately, the more stringent building regulations introduced in Türkiye in 2007 and 2018 were not consistently adhered to,
owing to corrupt practices involving contractors, inspection agencies, and local authorities [41]. In the aftermath of the 2023 Türkiye
earthquakes, demonstrations, and social media played a pivotal role in mobilizing demands for the arrest of contractors and inspection
agencies associated with the collapsed buildings, ultimately resulting in 332 arrests within two months of the earthquakes ([42], April
17).
In summary, the current study explored the influence of free will and determinism on political action participation intentions, while
investigating the mediating factors of anger and participative efficacy beliefs in a cross-sectional study in the context of protests
seeking punishment of immoral targets following the earthquakes in Türkiye in 2023. The objectives of this study are to contribute to
the existing literature by a) investigating the roles of free will, fatalistic and scientific determinism in relation to protest action in­
tentions, b) testing anger, and participative efficacy beliefs as focal mediators, c) focusing on a unique sociocultural context, namely
Türkiye, which has experienced two major earthquakes that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The study uses a large sample
collected one month after the disaster, ensuring timely data collection.
The majority of the hypotheses in this research were examined in an exploratory manner, while replicating established associa­
tions. Previous studies did not specifically investigate the relationships between beliefs—namely free will, scientific determinism, and
fatalistic determinism—and collective action. Additionally, there is a lack of research on the mediating mechanisms underlying these
associations drawing on existing literature and the theoretical arguments presented in the introduction, the following expectations are
proposed.
Hypothesis 1. Free will beliefs are positively associated with greater involvement in anti-corruption protest action.
Hypothesis 2. Scientific determinism beliefs are positively associated with greater involvement in anti-corruption protest action.
Hypothesis 3. Fatalistic determinism beliefs are negatively associated with involvement in anti-corruption protest action.
On the other hand, the link between anger and efficacy beliefs is well-established in the collective action literature. Based on
previous research on collective action, it is expected that:
Participative efficacy beliefs are positively related to protest action intentions (Hypothesis 4). Similarly, anger is positively related
to protest action intentions (Hypothesis 5). Although the link between anger, participative efficacy beliefs, and collective action is not
new, this study tests these associations in a unique context, following a deadly disaster and individuals’ intentions to protest against the
responsible corrupt bodies.
4. Method
4.1. Participants and procedure
The data was collected from university students in March and April 2023, one month after the earthquakes in Türkiye. Initially,
1098 adults participated in the survey for course credit via online survey but excluding 99 of them who failed to respond to the
attention check questions, and 19 who failed to respond to the dependent variables left a sample of 980 participants (Mage= 22.43, SD
= 4.07; 724 females, 254 males, and 2 unknown) taken into analyses. Participants were given the aims and the ethical consent forms on
the first page of the study. A minority of the participants were located in one of ten cities majorly affected by the earthquake (N = 97,
9.9 %) while 47.9 % of them were in cities that felt the shakes (N = 469), and 42.2 % were in cities that were not affected by the shakes
(N = 413). The majority of the participants reported not losing any close family members due to the earthquakes (N = 944, 96.3 %) but
around a quarter of the participants lost at least one friend (N = 254, 25.8 %).
4.2. Materials
All variables were measured using 7-point Likert-type scales. Thus, higher values indicate stronger free will, fatalistic, and scientific
determinism, anger, participative efficacy beliefs, and protest action intentions. All of the items with their translations are given in

Free Will, scientific determinism, and fatalistic determinism were measured with the Turkish version [43] of Free Will and Determinism
Plus (FAD Plus) developed by Paulhus and Carey [22]. Free will was measured with seven items (α = .73). An example item for free will
was ‘‘People have complete control over the decisions they make’’. Fatalistic determinism was measured with five items (α = .80). An
example item for fatalistic determinism was ‘‘My future has already been determined by fate’’. Scientific determinism was measured
with seven items (α = .66). An example item for scientific determinism was ‘‘Your genes determine your future’’. Participants
responded to how much they disagreed or agreed with the given statements (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).
Participative efficacy beliefs were measured with two items adapted from van Zomeren et al. [29]. These items were ‘‘I believe that I,
as an individual, can provide an important contribution so that, together, we can solve earthquake-related problems’’ and ‘‘I believe
that I, as an individual, can provide a significant contribution so that, through joint actions, we can solve earthquake-related prob­
lems’’ (α= .80, r =.76, p <. 001). The author translated these items from English to Turkish, and then a bilingual researcher
back-translated them to English. The final translations were then evaluated by a third bilingual researcher and determined that they
were appropriate. Participants were asked how much they disagreed or agreed with the given statements (1 = strongly disagree, 7 =
4

International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 115 (2024) 105031

Z. Ozkan

strongly agree).1
Anger was measured with two items asking how much they felt angry and furious about the loss of lives and property after the
earthquake. The response scale ranged from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely high). The two items formed a reliable scale (α= .98, r=. 88, p
< .001).
Protest action intentions were measured with five items asking participants their probability of partaking in various protest actions
about the punishment of those responsible for the loss of life and property following the earthquakes (α = .79). On scales ranging from
1 (definitely would not) to 7 (definitely would do), participants indicated their probability of (a) signing a petition demanding that those
responsible be brought to justice, (b) participating in a march peacefully protesting against those responsible, (c) making posts crit­
icizing those responsible on social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), (d) supporting a protest hashtag about those responsible, (e) vote
for politicians who promise to enforce the strictest rules on earthquake-resistant buildings.
5. Results
Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations are presented in Table 1. Fatalistic determinism was negatively correlated with
protest action intentions, while scientific determinism was not statistically correlated with protest action intentions. On the other
hand, free will, anger, and participative efficacy beliefs positively correlated with protest action intentions.
To test the proposed model, Mplus version 8 was used for structural equation modeling with latent scores [44]. The proposed model
places fatalistic determinism, scientific determinism, and free will as mediators, protest action intentions as the dependent variable,
and anger and participative efficacy beliefs as mediator variables. Fig. 1 presents the findings of the proposed model. Missing values
were dealt with full information maximum likelihood estimation. Overall fit indices showed a good fit, χ 2(327) = 705.85, χ 2/df = 2.16,
p < .001, RMSEA = .034; SRMR = .043; CFI = .957.
Results revealed that fatalistic determinism was directly and negatively related to protest action intentions (β = − .10, SE = .04, p =
.01, 95 % CI [− 0.18, − 0.02]) and anger (β = − .18, SE = .04, p < .001, 95 % CI [− 0.26, − 0.11]), but did not statistically significantly
relate to participative efficacy beliefs (β = − .01, SE = .04, p = .93, 95 % CI [− 0.08, 0.07]). Scientific determinism was not directly and
statistically significantly related to protest action intentions (β = .04, SE = .04, p = .36, 95 % CI [− 0.04, 0.12]) and participative
efficacy beliefs (β = .07, SE = .04, p = .09, 95 % CI [− 0.01, 0.15]). On the other hand, scientific determinism was positively related to
anger (β = .09, SE = .04, p = .03, 95 % CI [0.01, 0.17]). Free will did not directly and significantly relate to protest action intentions (β
= .05, SE = .05, p = .28, 95 % CI [− 0.04, 0.14]), and anger (β = .04, SE = .04, p < .32, 95 % CI [− 0.04, 0.12]). However, free will was
positively related to participative efficacy beliefs (β = .34, SE = .04, p < .001, 95 % CI [0.26, 0.42]).
Table 2 shows the results of decomposition analyses. The total effect between fatalistic determinism and protest action intentions
was negative and significant (β = − .17, SE = .04, p < .001, 95 % CI [− 0.25, − 0.09]). Associations between fatalistic determinism and
protest action intentions were partially explained only via anger. The total effect between scientific determinism and protest action
participation was not statistically significant (β = .09, SE = .05, p = .06, 95 % CI [− 0.01, 0.17]). However, anger significantly mediated
the association between scientific determinism and protest action participation. Finally, there was a significant total effect between
free will and protest action participation (β = .14, SE = .04, p < .01, 95 % CI [0.05, 0.22]). Results revealed that this association was
fully explained by participation efficacy beliefs.
6. Discussion
Deterministic and free will beliefs about the world have numerous roles in determining individuals’ behavior. However, previous
research did not examine the potential predictive roles of such beliefs on protest action intentions. In a novel and exploratory
approach, this research tested the association between fatalistic and scientific determinism, and free will and protest action partici­
pation intentions. Furthermore, stemming from the collective action literature, the mediating roles of anger and participative efficacy
beliefs were examined in these associations. In doing so, this research contributes to a significant gap in the collective action literature
by elucidating their relevance to intentions to participation in protests seeking punishment for immoral targets within a real-life
context of earthquakes marked by widespread corruption-related negligence [41], resulting in a significant loss of tens of thou­
sands of lives. Results revealed that fatalistic determinism was related to reduced protest action participation, while free will was
related to increased protest action participation. On the other hand, scientific determinism was not directly related to protest action
intentions, but it was indirectly related through increased anger.
Confirming Hypothesis 1, the findings of free will and increased protest action intentions are in line with previous research on prosocial behavior. This finding extends the beneficial role of free will beliefs beyond the already known pro-social domains of life, such as
improved outgroup attitudes [14], willingness to help, and reduced aggression [15], increased intolerance towards unethical be­
haviors [45,17] to include anti-corruption protest action intentions.
Influenced by Paulhus and Carey [22], this study investigated two types of determinism, fatalistic and scientific. Providing evi­
dence for Hypotheses 2 and 3, the results of the current study showed that fatalistic and scientific determinism are related to protest
action intentions differently. Rooted in religious beliefs, fatalistic determinism explains the world in terms of fate beyond individual
control, which may lead to a failure to protest corruption by ignoring the negligence of individual actors. However, scientific

determinism explains the world in terms of biological reasons [21]. Given their distinct theoretical foundations, fatalistic determinism
derives from fate (influenced by religion), whilst scientific determinism derives from biological principles of nature, it is crucial to
examine these two forms of determinism independently. The current study revealed that while fatalistic deterministic beliefs have
detrimental effects on protest action intentions, scientific determinism was not related to these intentions directly. Greater scientific
determinism may encourage people to critically examine the reasons behind the high casualty rates following the earthquake, making
them more willing to criticize irresponsible authorities. However, when it comes to protest action, scientific determinism did not
emerge as a significant predictor. As demonstrated in the current study, emotional motives, such as anger, were stronger correlates of
protest participation. Future research could delve deeper into why scientific determinism was not a key factor in shaping intentions to

participate in protests.
The current study found that both participative efficacy beliefs (confirming Hypothesis 4) and anger (confirming Hypothesis 5)
were related to increased protest action intentions. These findings align with prior collective action literature (see Ref. [28,29]), which
highlights the importance of perceived efficacy and emotions in motivating participation in protests. One of the significant contri­
butions of this research is replicating previous research on collective action in a novel political context—anti-corruption protest action
intentions following a deadly earthquake.
Importantly, the study revealed that efficacy beliefs were strongly shaped by underlying belief systems, particularly free will.
Individuals who held stronger beliefs in free will also reported higher levels of participative efficacy, reflecting a conviction that their
actions could make a tangible difference. This is consistent with theories of agency [25], where belief in one’s own capacity to in­
fluence outcomes enhances the likelihood of taking action. When people believe that they can impact change through their own
choices, they are more likely to engage in a cost-benefit analysis [31] and view their participation as a means of achieving collective
goals [29,32].
This study further revealed that anger partially mediated the relationship between fatalistic determinism and participation in
protest actions. Individuals who strongly endorsed fatalistic determinism reported lower levels of anger regarding the loss of lives and
property after the earthquakes, which, in turn, was associated with reduced intentions to protest.
Conversely, those who believed in scientific determinism experienced greater anger over the losses, which was linked to an
increased intention to engage in protests. Believers in scientific determinism may feel outraged by the deaths caused by the earthquake
because they view them as preventable, provided that organizations adhere to regulations set by scientists and experts. In contrast,
fatalistic determinists may not feel as angry, perceiving these deaths as inevitable, predetermined by fate, and therefore unavoidable.
In the aftermath of mass destruction aggravated by corruption, survivors may experience anger rooted in relative deprivation (Abrams
& Grant, 2012; [35,36]), particularly when comparing their situation to residents of other earthquake-prone countries that, due to the
strict enforcement of building regulations, have not suffered significant losses.
Although anger was a focal emotion in this study, it is important to note that other emotions such as fear, disgust, or sadness may
also play a role in motivating protest action. However, this research focused on anger specifically because it is commonly associated
with perceptions of injustice and moral outrage, which have been shown to be strong motivators of protest behavior [29]. Future
research could explore how other emotions interact with belief systems like determinism and free will to shape protest participation.
6.1. Limitations and future directions
Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the data collection employed convenience sampling and focused
on university students residing in the medium-sized Turkish city of Ordu, who had experienced the 2023 earthquakes without
encountering fatalities, as they were situated at a considerable distance from the earthquake’s epicenter. Notably, the study sample
also encompassed students originating from cities that endured the full brunt of the earthquake’s devastation, with a noteworthy
observation being that one-quarter of the participants reported the loss of at least one friend during the catastrophic event.
Furthermore, it is pertinent to highlight that the central district of Ordu, from which a substantial portion of our study sample was
drawn, lies within a seismic risk zone categorized as the third level, and the surrounding provinces are classified under first and secondlevel seismic risk zones [46]. This existence and difference in earthquake risks in different parts of the city shows the importance of
examining this sample. Although testing these hypotheses in a non-Western country is beneficial due to the overrepresentation of
WEIRD samples in psychology literature [47], the sample still consists of university students.
This study did not examine the role of ingroup identification [48], which can be a critical factor in participation in protest actions,
particularly in the context of protests following disasters [32,33]. Specifically, identities based on shared fate can emerge after di­
sasters, leading to increased protest intentions [49]. Political (e.g., right-wing) and religious identities could reduce the likelihood of
participating in protests and may serve as confounding factors in the relationship between free will, determinism, and political action.
Therefore, future research is needed to examine the role of ingroup identification (e.g., political and religious) in conjunction with free
will and determinism in the context of post-disaster protests to address this issue.
It is important to note that, in the survey, while efficacy beliefs were framed in more general terms regarding actions related to
"earthquake-related problems" the wordings for protest actions were more specific, focusing on the punishment of those responsible for
the loss of life and property following the earthquakes. However, given the context and timing, it was evident that these problems
stemmed from corruption, which led to the loss of thousands of civilian lives and the destruction of several cities. The news and social
media were filled with discussions about the faulty practices and neglect that caused these tragedies. Additionally, the findings on
efficacy beliefs and protest action intentions were consistent with previous research on collective action [23,29], suggesting that this
potential limitation did not negatively impact the results. To prevent any potential mismatches, it is advisable for future studies to
ensure consistent wording across all measures.
The present study employs a large sample collected promptly after the devastating earthquakes, offering a timely examination of
the topic. Even though larger samples can enhance the accuracy of estimates [50], they may also make weak effects appear statistically
significant. Hence, it’s important to assess results based on both their statistical and theoretical significance. Additionally, replicating
the proposed model—linking beliefs in determinism and free will to political action via efficacy beliefs and anger—in diverse contexts
would strengthen its generalizability. Whether the current findings extend to other post-disaster or broader social protest settings
remains to be determined through further research.
Finally, it is important to note that the correlational findings of this study do not allow for causal interpretations. Employing diverse
methodologies, including longitudinal studies, would offer additional evidence regarding the associations between these beliefs and
7

International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 115 (2024) 105031

Z. Ozkan

intentions for protest action. Specifically, certain longitudinal analyses (see Ref. [51]) can reveal whether appraisals of corruption
determine belief systems, if belief systems influence appraisals, or if there is a bidirectional relationship between the two.
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights into the associations between free will, fatalistic determinism, and scientific
determinism with protest action intentions, particularly following a disaster marked by corruption-related negligence. The results
suggest that free will beliefs are linked to greater protest participation, while fatalistic determinism is associated with lower intentions
to participate. Scientific determinism, although not directly related to protest intentions, is connected to protest participation through
heightened anger. The roles of anger and participative efficacy emphasize the importance of emotional and cognitive factors in col­
lective action. By investigating these relationships in a real-world context, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how
underlying belief systems are related to the motivation to protest in the wake of large-scale disasters.

(Received 31 January 2022; accepted 23 July 2022)
Although physical laws or theories are often invoked in debates over “causality” and “determinism,”
our best current understanding of physics assigns only a limited (though still very broad) validity to
these concepts. It may be, thus, helpful (particularly when having to deal with the challenges posed
by quantum mechanics) to think of them as prejudices, extrapolated from our experience with a
limited (essentially classical) set of phenomena and/or theoretical models. This paper discusses how,
over time, different physical theories have either reinforced or challenged these prejudices, focusing
specifically on conservative “Laplacian” mechanics, dissipative mechanics (thermal physics), and
quantum mechanics. # 2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

Aristotle called a “source of change,”12 most often referred
to as an “efficient cause.” This, as the word itself suggests, is
an intuition directly derived from watching an agent doing

“To know the causes of things”1 has been quoted since antiquity as the goal of what came to be called first natural philosophy, and ultimately science. Certainly physics has been
constantly concerned with, and hugely successful at, answering
“why”-type questions over the past three centuries. “Causality”
itself is often invoked in physics as a technical term, intended
to formalize the more-or-less intuitive notion that “causes must
always precede their effects”; as such, it may be used to derive
mathematical requirements, such as the Kramers–Kronig relations in electromagnetism,2 or, more recently, a number of
results in the quantum information theory.3,4
Nevertheless, the relation between physics and what philosophers call causality is, to say, the least, complicated (see,
for example, the Resource Letter,5 and, for a more up-to-date
review6). This is in part because physics’ answers to “why”
questions do not always involve one single kind of “cause”
(e.g., sometimes the answer involves a “force,” and other
times a “law of nature”). This mirrors and may even be in
part responsible for the philosophers’ own difficulties to
agree on a precise, universally applicable notion of causality.
As a somewhat extreme example, in 1913 Bertrand Russell
wrote, in an influential article7 that “the word ‘cause’ is so
inextricably bound up with misleading associations as to
make its complete extrusion from the philosophical vocabulary desirable.” On the physics side, although important
physicists, such as Mach and Kirchhoff, had previously
raised similar concerns about the vagueness of the “cause”
concept,6 it is probably fair to say that nobody was really
prepared for the challenge to our intuition posed by the
advent of quantum mechanics, which, as I will detail below,
seems to force us to contemplate “effects” (e.g., outcomes of
measurements) for which no “cause” can be identified, in
any useful sense of the word. Indeed, in a 1950 article,8
Niels Bohr wrote that quantum mechanics is “even irreconcilable with the very idea of causality.”
In this paper, I wish to present and explore the notion that
our intuitive belief that every physical event must have a
proximate (and also physical) cause as well as the characteristics that we expect this cause to exhibit are (like many
of our pre-relativity, pre-quantum beliefs) essentially
prejudices that we acquire from our earliest experiences with
a limited sector of the natural world: Namely, the sector
described primarily by macroscopic, classical, dissipative
physics. On the one hand, this may be taken to establish the

existence of a vast domain of phenomena, where our intuitive causal reasoning holds; on the other hand (and in essential agreement with Ref. 8), it explains why we should not
expect it to be universally applicable. Interestingly, part of
my argument will include the observation that not only quantum mechanics but also (in subtler ways) classical conservative mechanics fails to meet our “causal prejudices,” which
may be one reason why it is so hard to get our first-year
physics students to adopt that particular model of the world.
It is tempting to view the related, but distinct, concept of
“determinism” as an extreme manifestation of our causal
prejudice. Clearly, we could be led to believe that future
events are completely determined by present circumstances
if we could envision an unbroken, closed chain of causation
starting from the present moment.9 However, I would argue
that, unlike causation, which has a solid empirical foundation
within its domain of applicability, determinism (at least as a
“global” view of the world) is fundamentally a theoretical
prejudice, born not from experience but from speculation; in
the form of “fatalism” it certainly predates modern science,
and in a pre-scientific form, it may already be found in the
atomistic views of Lucretius.1 In modern science, however,
determinism was given a strong impetus, and even, in some
sense, a mathematical foundation, by the “clockwork” model
of the world proposed by the classical, conservative mechanics of Newton and Laplace. Additionally, I will also discuss
how this idea has fared within later models, although I will
certainly not try to cover all of physics; see Ref. 10 for a
much more comprehensive review.11
The organization of this article is as follows: In Sec. II, I
will try to provide suitable, if somewhat provisional, definitions of a “physical cause” and a “deterministic model.” In
Secs. II–V, I will explore how these notions are, or are not,
embodied in three specific physical models: conservative
“Laplacian” mechanics, dissipative mechanics (thermal
physics), and quantum mechanics with field theories being
also briefly considered along the way. Section VI provides a
summary of what I believe is the current status of these concepts in physics.

something, which typically means pushing or pulling on
something: exerting a force on something, moving something. I will take the following characteristics of such an
intuition from Ref. 5, although this specific list may go back
as far as Hume:13

(ii)
(iii)

The cause (C) occurs before the effect (E).
C is “spatially proximate” to E.
There is a consistent pattern in which, for similar systems and similar situations, E follows C. This last
condition is an appeal to regularity, the notion that
“the same causes produce the same effects.”

III. CONSERVATIVE CLASSICAL MECHANICS
(POINT PARTICLES)
It seems at first sight that Newtonian classical mechanics
with its unquestionable explanatory power should naturally
fit our expectations of a causal theory. The most natural
impulse, in fact, is to read Newton’s second law
~ ¼ m~

as a statement of a “cause and effect” relationship with the
“cause,” the force, on the left-hand side, and the effect, the
acceleration, or change in the particle’s state of motion, on
the right-hand side. This, however, does not quite work, for
at least two reasons: First, a full explanation of motion in the
Newtonian framework requires more than just forces, and
second, the forces of conservative mechanics are not really a
good fit to what we intuitively expect from “physical
causes,” as presented in Sec. II.

To see the first point, consider, for example, what is
required to explain why the moon turns around the earth: It
is not just that the earth pulls on it. That, strictly speaking,
only explains why its path bends. You also have to explain
why it does not simply fall straight down on us, and for that
you need to invoke the law of inertia (or, alternatively, the
law of conservation of angular momentum) and the initial
conditions that set it on a path with nonzero angular momentum eons ago. The latter, that is to say, the initial state of the
system, is always implicitly assumed to be part of any causal
description. However, the law of inertia or conservation of
angular momentum are abstract concepts, not something that
we can associate with an “agent.”
In fact, the law of inertia is in a sense the opposite of an
efficient cause. The latter is invoked to explain a change in
an object’s state, whereas the former expresses the tendency
of an initial state of motion to persist. Because our intuition
is molded by everyday dissipative dynamics, we have a very
hard time accepting the fact that no external agency is
required, in principle, to keep an object in uniform motion
forever. On the contrary, we imagine forces at work—most
notably, the centrifugal force—in situations where there
aren’t any, and the observed effects are entirely due to
inertia.
B. Forces themselves are problematic
The second point above concerns the nature of the actual
forces. Gravity, understood as an “action at a distance” certainly does not meet the criterion (ii) of Sec. II (spatial proximity), which is no doubt why many different mechanical
models were proposed for it and other long-range forces
through the years.16 Interestingly, in a modern picture based
on general relativity, one would not even consider gravity a
“force” but the result of a distortion of spacetime by a massive object. In such a picture, the motion of the moon would
be entirely explained by a modified “law of inertia,” namely,
unforced motion along a geodesic line.
As for contact forces, we know from teaching introductory
physics that they also often conflict with our intuition, particularly the so-called “reaction forces” (such as normal forces
and tensions), which are associated with constraints in the
more formal treatments of the subject. In introductory
courses, we present them as forces exerted by inert objects in
response to their being pushed or pulled; they are formally
required for Eq. (1) to work (a book sitting on a table would
start accelerating downward if the only force acting on it was
gravity), but to believe in their existence as “efficient causes”
requires that we grant “agency” to inanimate, motionless
objects like tables, something our students are, understandably, reluctant to do. Perhaps more critically, the whole concept of “action” and “reaction” strongly implies the sort of
time ordering postulated in criterion (i) of Sec. II: The reaction (effect) should happen after the cause, yet nothing we
tell our students suggests that this is in fact the case, rather
the contrary: The two forces are always presented as
simultaneous.
I will argue in Sec. III that a better description of what
happens in these cases, and one more in agreement with our
intuition, is possible when we consider the dissipative
dynamics of extended objects. In the pure conservative,
Newtonian dynamics of ideal point masses, however, forces

When trying to correlate this intuition with the formal
models (or “theories”) of physics through the ages, it seems
natural to focus on the effect being some kind of motion:
This is most typically what we expect to result from any
form of physical action, and in classical physics, it is a fact
that all changes in the state of a system reduce ultimately,
directly or indirectly, to the motion of its parts.14 This is not
necessarily the case in quantum mechanics, where motion, in
the classical sense of following a definite trajectory, is not
one of the “primitives” of the theory: Here, instead we may
want to look for the causes of a more general change in the
state of a system with “state” defined in an appropriate way.
Determinism appears, on the surface at least, easier to
define precisely: We can say that a theory or model is deterministic if the state of a system at some time completely
determines its state at a future time. Here again, however, it
may appear that quantum mechanics poses a problem,
because the object typically taken to represent the state of a
closed system—the wavefunction—is supposed to evolve
deterministically in between observations, and only “jump”
unpredictably when the system is observed. However, the
wavefunction is essentially the square root of a probability
distribution, so whether it evolves deterministically or not
has no bearing on whether the physical attributes of the system (such as positions and momenta of the various particles)
do so. To avoid ambiguity in what we mean by determinism
in this case, we should ask whether the information we can
obtain about the system by measuring any given set of variables at a time t determines or not the results that we would
obtain if we observed those same variables (or any others,
for that matter) at a later time t þ Dt. The presentation in
Sec. V, below, implicitly adopts this definition.15

A. Not all “causes” are forces

do literally come in pairs, and there is something artificial in
the splitting of a single interaction into two separate forces
to be interpreted as two separate “causes”: properly speaking, there is only one “cause” affecting simultaneously the
two particles, and that is the interaction itself. This becomes
clear when one replaces Eq. (1) by the proper equation of
motion for a closed system of particles

implicit assumption that the values of the initial conditions
“have” in any meaningful sense, an infinite number of exact
digits (see also Ref. 15 and the comments on classically chaotic systems and amplification of quantum mechanical
uncertainty in Secs. IV C and V C).

~ij is the force exerted by particle j on particle
Here, F
i, which, for conservation of momentum, I have taken to
depend only on the difference between their position vectors,
~
r j and ~
r i . The velocity ~
v i itself is the derivative with respect
to time of the vector ~
r i , which definitely complicates the
causal interpretation of Eq. (2), because the object being
acted on appears on both the “effect” side (the left side) and
the “cause” side (the right side) of the equation. Once we
reach this point, arguably, the usefulness of thinking of
forces as causative agents is at an end. The motion of the system is determined, as a whole, by the interactions—abstract
“agents” expressed by appropriate potential energy functions—the “laws of motion,” and the initial conditions. It is
telling that, in fact, in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, forces do not even appear at all.

The moment one moves away from point particles to deal
with real-world extended objects, the macroscopic dynamics
becomes non-conservative or “dissipative,” meaning that the
mechanical energy expressed in terms of the macroscopic
variables is typically not conserved in interactions anymore:
rather, a fraction of it is always dispersed among the
“particles” that make up the interacting objects, becoming
“disorganized energy,” that is, thermal energy.
Mathematically, this dissipation is most often treated by
using equations of motion that contain empirically determined
quantities such as coefficients of restitution, coefficients of
friction, and viscosities. Attempting to derive these quantities
from microscopic models is generally an extremely challenging task. Perhaps, the simplest example of such an equation is
the following one, describing the damping of an object’s
motion through a viscous medium

For dissipative processes that take place near thermal
equilibrium, or that lead to it, thermodynamics provides a
valuable framework for dealing with the system’s macroscopic variables. This framework is to a large extent independent of microscopic models; to the extent it is not, it may
be properly regarded as placing constraints on them. For
example, if the object described in Eq. (3) is to eventually
approach thermal equilibrium with the medium at a temperature T, its mean kinetic energy cannot really go to zero, but
rather must approach the value 32 kB T, where kB is
Boltzmann’s constant. To ensure this, an equation for the
instantaneous velocity can be written in the form

nðtÞ is zero, but the
average of its square needs to have a precise relationship to
the damping coefficient c in order to ensure that, asymptotically, h12 mv2 i ¼ 32 kB T (as required by equipartition of energy).
This result, which goes back to Einstein’s theory of Brownian
motion,22 is an instance of the so-called “fluctuation-dissipation theorem,”23 which associates with every dissipative process a “noise” term with specific properties.

Perhaps counterintuitively, however, the main problem of
the system of Eq. (2), from the point of view of trying to satisfy our “causality prejudice,” is that it describes a totally
deterministic situation: The initial positions and velocities
determine, in principle, all the positions and velocities for all
time afterwards. This does not sound too bad until one realizes that the system is also fully deterministic in reverse: that
is to say, the positions and velocities at any one time determine uniquely both the future and the past: one might as
well say that the present conditions “cause” the future events
as that the future events “cause” the past. There is, in Eq. (2),
no “arrow of time” at all, and this is a feature of the model
that makes it impossible to reconcile it with our intuition of
what causation should look like.17
Historically, Hume did refuse to consider Newton’s forces
as legitimate causes based at least in part on some of the
issues I have raised in Subsection II B.18 On the other hand,
the deterministic character of the model was adopted by
many as an accurate description of the universe, as evidenced by the famous quotation of Laplace: “An intellect
which at a certain moment would know all forces that set
nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which
nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to
submit these data to analysis […] for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would
be present before its eyes.”19,20
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the system the
model (2) describes could only be realized in actuality by a
collection of classical point particles, or perfectly rigid
spheres with no internal (thermal) energy. This does not
actually describe anything in the known universe, so the
hypothesis of total determinism in physics in the 19th century was, to say, the least, somewhat premature.
Interestingly, also, a challenge to this classical determinism has recently been issued21 based on a rejection of the

IV. DISSIPATIVE MECHANICS OF EXTENDED
OBJECTS (THERMAL AND STATISTICAL PHYSICS)

Sec. II in one important respect: Namely, a delay between
the application of the force and its full effect appears naturally, for two reasons. First, in an extended object, a force
applied to one end does not reach the other end instantly: A
sculptor would be correct in assuming that the chipping off
of the stone does in fact happen sometime after the hammer
hits the chisel, even if the delay is not directly perceptible.
Moreover, when dissipation is included in the dynamics of a
system, it always results in a finite response time for the system as a whole to react to an external force.
An interesting example of this is provided by the reaction
forces considered in Sec. III. Consider, for instance, what
happens when a weight is deposited on a table. The simplest
model to account for the table’s “reaction force” is to treat it
as a very stiff, damped harmonic oscillator, satisfying (in an
average sense, as in Eq. (3)) an equation of this type

C. Thermal physics and determinism
The model of dissipative dynamics presented above is
explicitly non-deterministic: Eqs. such as (3) and (5) look
deterministic, but, as I have argued, they can only apply to
an ensemble average. An individual realization of, for
instance, the motion of a Brownian particle would have to be
described by an equation such as (4), which contains a random noise term that makes the detailed trajectory of the particle unpredictable. Note also how, between the dissipation
and the noise, the particle eventually loses all “memory” of
the initial conditions and, indeed, of its whole dynamical history, something that could never happen in the closed, deterministic system described in Eq. (2).
Nevertheless, it is legitimate to ask to what extent this is
just an approximation, and, in particular, whether the randomness of what may, in general, be called “thermal noise”
is intrinsic, or only a useful simplification of what otherwise
would be an intractable problem, namely, the exact calculation of such forces from an appropriate microscopic model.
The early workers on the “molecular-kinetic theory of heat,”
such as Maxwell, Boltzmann, and even, later, Einstein himself, did in fact assume that molecular collisions happened at
random in this spirit of simplification.22,24,25 By default, the
only microscopic model they had available at the time was
the classical, conservative dynamics of point particles discussed in Sec. III, and in that framework, which is fully
deterministic, the assumption of true randomness has to be
regarded, indeed, as just an approximation.
On the other hand, it was precisely their work that eventually established that classical mechanics could not be a valid
description of the dynamical behavior of atoms and

V. QUANTUM MECHANICS
A. Microscopic indeterminism and acausality
It is easy to see that “textbook” quantum mechanics is
both indeterministic and acausal from the following example. Consider an isolated atom prepared in an excited state.

where F is the applied force. In steady state, the spring is
compressed just enough to make the right-hand side of Eq.
(5) equal to zero, which, with dx=dt ¼ 0, means the force
exerted by the oscillator, kx, matches the applied force.
However, it is easy to see that it takes a time at least of the
order of m=c for this equilibration of the forces to take place.
Thus, the intuition of our students is, in fact, correct: In this
context, namely, the dissipative interaction between
extended, deformable objects, the “reaction” force (the
“effect”) is delayed, even if it is only imperceptibly with
respect to the “action” (the “cause”).

molecules26 and led to the replacement of that old deterministic model by quantum mechanics, which, as I will argue in
Sec. V, is definitely non-deterministic. Not only that, but in
quantum mechanics, the very concept of a trajectory of particles having simultaneously well-defined values of position
and momentum, which was essential to the predictive power
of classical mechanics (as Eq. (2) makes clear), is valid only
in an approximate way, and, for colliding molecules, only
for a very short time. Given, then, that the only microscopic
model we currently have that can successfully be used to
derive the results of thermal physics is explicitly nondeterministic, it seems natural to assume that thermal noise
is, in fact, truly random (i.e., intrinsically unpredictable) and
place the burden of proof on anybody who wishes to show
that it is not: namely, to derive it from an appropriate deterministic, microscopic theory, which, at the moment, simply
does not exist.
That being said, it is nevertheless the case that the equations of dissipative dynamics, even if intrinsically nondeterministic, do still have a limited predictive power, which
may vary greatly from one case to another. The Brownian
particle described in Eq. (4), for instance, will perform a random walk, so that its position as a function of time will
become increasingly unpredictable, whereas a harmonic
oscillator described in Eq. (5) (augmented by the appropriate
noise terms) will, because of the presence of the restoring
force kx, settle down to performing small oscillations around
its new equilibrium position with a constant r.m.s. average
displacement Dx such that (in one dimension) 12 kðDxÞ2
¼ 12 kB T. For a macroscopic oscillator at room temperature,
this Dx will certainly be negligibly small.
In general, we can expect that stable structures and systems, whether natural or engineered, will keep fluctuations
under control through various feedback mechanisms, leading
to a behavior that is largely predictable on average, and
unpredictable only within a tolerable range for individual
instances. Importantly, for such systems, the effect of an
external force is usually also predictable (also within certain
limits), which makes causal agency possible; in particular,
the third requirement in Sec. II, that “similar causes produce
similar effects,” will typically be satisfied.
On the other hand, there are dynamical systems, typically
nonlinear, that exhibit extreme sensitivity to “noise”
(whether external or internal, including uncertainty in the
initial conditions), and these become fundamentally unpredictable after a certain time, as microscopic fluctuations are
blown up into large, macroscopic differences: The weather is
the most famous example, but such “chaotic dynamics” are
actually ubiquitous in nature.27 One can find examples even
in our solar system (whose current, overall, extreme regularity inspired the absolutely deterministic model of Sec. III): at
least one of the moons of Saturn, Hyperion, exhibits such a
chaotic motion that to predict it accurately over a length of
time greater than about 20 years would require one to specify
its initial conditions to greater accuracy than allowed by
quantum mechanics.28

Even with full information about the atom and its coupling
to the electromagnetic field, one cannot predict at what time
it will decay or in which direction it will emit a photon when
doing so. Even after the event is observed, one still cannot
answer the question of why the atom decayed at the particular time it did, or why it emitted the photon in that particular
direction. It is interesting to note that this state of things was,
in fact, anticipated by Einstein already in one of his earliest
papers on the quantum theory,29 where he wrote, with some
concern, that “the theory … leaves time and direction of elementary processes to chance.” (The paper in question was
actually about the recoil that atoms and molecules must
experience as they absorb or emit photons while in thermal
equilibrium with a “radiation bath,” so Einstein’s concern is
directly relevant to the question posed in Sec. IV C above
regarding the random nature of thermal noise.)
As it happened, however, the later development of a fullfledged quantum mechanics only further cemented the randomness that Einstein was worried about. Basically, the formal difficulty may be described as follows: in quantum
mechanics, a system may be assigned a state that is a sum
(called a coherent superposition) of states in which one or
several different properties have different values (in what
follows I will call such properties “undefined”). For instance,
the atom-photon system in the previous example could, at a
time t > 0, be assigned the state

B. Macroscopic predictability
In spite of what has just been said, indeterminism at the
quantum level is fully compatible at the macroscopic level
with the “limited predictability” discussed in Sec. IV. As the
simplest example, consider a time interval over which dissipation is negligible, and an object of mass M whose potential
energy can be written as a function of the center of mass
coordinates to a good approximation. Then the Heisenberg
equation of motion for the center of mass position operator
can be written as

The last term is the total external force acting on the object,
so this is just like the classical result (1). Note, however, that
since ^r cm is an operator, this equation still includes “noise,”
so it is only approximately deterministic; whether the
approximation is good or not, and for how long, depends on

Here, s is the lifetime of the excited state, the atomic states
jei and jgi represent the atom in the excited and ground
states, respectively, and j0i and j1ðtÞi represent field states
with zero and one photon, respectively. In addition, the state
j1ðtÞi is itself a coherent superposition of single photon
states traveling in different directions away from the atom.
Accordingly, in state (6), both the energy of the atom (i.e.,
whether it is in the ground or the excited state) and the direction of travel of the photon are “undefined,” and, indeed, so
is whether there is a photon in the field at all. Under these
circumstances, the basic postulates of quantum mechanics
(in particular, the so-called Born rule) do not predict with
certainty what value will be obtained when one of these variables is observed or “measured” (they just assign a probability to each possible outcome); nor do they provide any
retroactive explanation for why a particular value was
obtained in an individual observation.
Admittedly, this is a disturbing state of affairs for those
raised in classical physics. The natural reaction, and one
started by Einstein30 himself, is to assume that the quantum
mechanical description of physical reality (as embodied in,
e.g., the state (6)) is incomplete: When we prepare an atom
in an excited state, say, there must be some other variables
involved, perhaps inaccessible to us, and hence not included
in the description (6), that actually cause it to decay at one
particular time and in a particular direction. A number of
such “additional variable” (or, more commonly “hidden variable”) theories have been proposed through the years, in various flavors;31 some, like the DeBroglie–Bohm trajectories,
are fully deterministic, while others, like the ones that propose actual modifications to the Schr€odinger equation, often
include a stochastic component.32
All these formal extensions of quantum mechanics, however, face a serious difficulty. If the probabilities they predict

for some outcomes disagree with the predictions of standard
quantum mechanics, they can, in principle, be disproved by
experiments, which, on the contrary, have confirmed the
quantum mechanical predictions spectacularly well through
the years. On the other hand, a remarkable series of theorems33–35 shows that, in order to agree with the predictions
of quantum mechanics, these theories must assign contextual
values to any undefined variables that might be measured in
an experiment, meaning that the value obtained, in general,
depends on what other variables, if any, one chooses to measure at the same time.36 This has particularly striking consequences in the case of what are known as “entangled states”
of two (or more) particles, which are states in which individual properties of the particles are undefined, and only global
properties (such as their sum) are assigned a definite value
by the standard formalism (state (6) above is, in fact, such an
entangled state, as is the “EPR” state of Ref. 30 and the
famous “Schr€odinger cat”).37 In that case, to reproduce the
joint probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics, a causal
theory must allow for the outcome of a measurement on one
particle to be influenced somehow by the experimental setup
used to measure the other particle, regardless of how far
away the particles are.
In a recent study, Wood and Spekkens38 concluded that
such “causal” explanations of the correlations experimentally observed in entangled states necessarily must rely on
either (a) a causal influence traveling from one location to
the other faster than light, or backwards in time, or (b) some
kind of “superdeterminism” in which some unspecified
forces work to ensure that not all the possible combinations
of experimental settings and values of the hidden variables
actually occur in the experiment (or at least some of them
occur far less often than random chance would allow). Apart
from its conspiratorial nature (you can, of course, “explain”
anything by postulating a sufficiently complex conspiracy),
this explanation is also manifestly nonlocal, since it somehow has to exclude joint values of variables that are located
at different places. In short, any possible causal explanations
of the correlations observed in quantum mechanical experiments would require causation mechanisms that would fail
to satisfy one or more of our causal intuitions, as presented
in Sec. II.39

considerations such as those presented at the end of Sec.
IV C (see also Sec. V C).
When dissipation is not negligible, there are fairly standard ways to introduce it in a quantum description of the system’s dynamics, either through the use of Langevin
operators23 or the density matrix formalism.40 Either way,
quantum mechanics is the foundation of all modern statistical physics and can be used to derive all the results of thermodynamics, including both average values of macroscopic
quantities and fluctuations around those averages. Note that
this means it is perfectly legitimate to think of thermodynamic fluctuations as having a quantum origin, as argued in
Sec. IV C, even in the “classical limit” when Planck’s constant drops out of the relevant equations (as in the
“equipartition of energy” results used in Sec. IV).

something to happen at a remote location by sending something there.
In spite of this, it is, fascinating to read the account, in
Ref. 14, of Poincare’s first reaction to Maxwell’s classical
field theory, which made many physicists of its time uneasy
for not being “mechanical enough”—much like Newton’s
theory of gravity had in its time.16 It is also remarkable to
note that gravity remains, after all this time, something of an
outlier: initially dismissed by mechanists as an unacceptable
form of action at a distance, eventually “demoted” from a
force to a property of spacetime, and finally demonstrated,
quite recently, to propagate at a finite speed (in the form of
gravitational waves43), its quantization remains one of the
greatest open problems in physics.
VI. CONCLUSIONS

C. Macroscopic unpredictability

D. Field theory
At what might be called the ultimate level, the modern
description of the physical world employs quantum field theories, which combine quantum mechanics with the requirements of special relativity. It is interesting that in these
models, the “action at a distance” that had bothered Newton
and his contemporaries so much does not exist: All interactions take place via the exchange of (real or virtual)
“particles” (field quanta), and these particles cannot travel
faster than the speed of light. At the classical level, this had
already been anticipated when it was discovered that electromagnetic waves carried energy and momentum at a finite
speed. In this sense, all the instances of “action at a distance”
involving electromagnetic fields that are ubiquitous in the
modern world do not pose any real challenge to our intuition

Although in most cases quantum fluctuations will be negligible for large systems, there are many situations where
amplification of quantum uncertainty even to the macroscopic level can take place. An obvious example of such a
process is simply the measurement of any “undefined”
quantity. For instance, one could imagine surrounding the
atom in Sec. V A with photodetectors connected to clocks
set to stop when the emitted photon is detected: which
clock will stop and what time it will read are then intrinsically unpredictable macroscopic events. It is interesting to
note, along these lines, that there are now a number of
schemes (some even commercially available) that use quantum mechanics to generate truly random (as opposed to
pseudorandom) numbers.41
In addition to these, there are also many naturally occurring situations where this amplification of quantum fluctuations can happen, including phase transitions and dynamical
instabilities such as the “chaotic” systems mentioned in Sec.
IV C. It is also not unlikely, in my opinion, that this fundamental source of randomness in nature could have been
incorporated by evolution into the “decision making” mechanisms of living things, as randomized algorithms are known
to often have advantages over deterministic ones. At least
one paper42 has presented an idea on how it could be harnessed to produce something strongly resembling (if not
identical to) “free will,” whether in a living being or (intriguingly) even in a computer.

Physicists will probably be surprised to learn that the
validity of our everyday, intuitive concepts of causation has
been repeatedly questioned by philosophers, and this long
before quantum mechanics entered the picture! Here, I have
tried to show, first, that despite this criticism there are, in
fact, a myriad of physical situations where it is perfectly adequate to use the language of cause and effect. In particular,
external forces acting on stable, dissipative mechanical systems satisfy all the requirements our intuition demands of an
“efficient cause” and are very likely to have provided us with
the basis for such an intuition (Sec. IV). The flip side of this
is that we may have a natural reluctance to accept as a valid
causal explanation one that does not rely, crudely speaking,
on something like a contact force. This includes even
mechanical phenomena that can be properly explained by
the law of inertia, but where we insist on “seeing” the action
of fictitious forces, like the “centrifugal” force. It may also
include chemical or biological processes that are perhaps
explained most naturally in terms of somewhat less
“mechanical” concepts such as entropy or chemical potentials. Nevertheless, I believe that as long as we stay in the
domain of classical dissipative systems “safe” extensions of
causal reasoning will almost certainly always be possible.44
The analysis presented here also reveals some interesting,
and possibly unexpected, aspects of the relationship between
causality and determinism. On the one hand, the completely
deterministic models, lacking an arrow of time, of conservative classical mechanics (Sec. III) seem to leave no room for
true causal action. On the other hand, the dissipative processes considered in Sec. IV, which do introduce a time
asymmetry and make causal action possible, also introduce
“noise” that eventually causes macro- and mesoscopic systems to “forget” their initial conditions, and thus sets up
something like a “predictability horizon”: a time beyond
which, without further intervention, deterministic evolution
breaks down (or becomes trivial, e.g., the system simply
stops and comes into thermal equilibrium with its surroundings). To the extent this noise can be considered truly random and is found at all levels (from the micro- to the
macroscopic) of physical description, it makes closed,
bottom-up, fully deterministic causal chains impossible to
establish for most individual realizations of natural processes, although in many cases it may still allow for very
high-accuracy predictions in an average sense.
Finally, underpinning all this, at the very bottom level, we
find quantum mechanics. Although debates about its interpretation still go on (and will probably go on forever, since

they revolve around unobservable things), I have argued
here (Sec. V) that none of the proposed “interpretations”
actually increase, in practice, the predictive power of the theory, whereas the ones that claim to offer causal explanations
would have to rely on “causes” that are well outside our classically formed intuitions. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics
is also far from lawless: individual quantum processes may
exhibit a “freedom” that may well be irreducible,45 but on
average the outcomes of many such processes, identically set
up, need to exhibit the frequencies predicted by Born’s rule.
As such, quantum mechanics functions perfectly as a mathematical formalism to keep track of correlations between
observations (cf. Ref. 31, Sec. VI A). While this might be
taken to vindicate Hume’s suggestion13 that correlations, not
“causes,” are all we can ever truly know, I hope to have
made the case here that the reality of the physical world as
we experience it is richer (if somewhat messier) than that.

11
Earman’s review (Ref. 10) is, in fact, a very good example of the strong
association, in physics at least, of “determinism” with, essentially, differential equations. It covers many intriguing examples of non-unique or
“pathological” solutions to problems in classical mechanics, classical field
theories, and both special and general relativity. Unfortunately, I do not
find this a very useful approach to the problem of determinism in quantum
mechanics. Rather, to me, as I will try to make clear in Sec. V, the one-tomany relation between state vectors and measurement outcomes, as posited in the “orthodox” formalism and observed in actual experiments, is
the very definition of indeterminism.

The emphasis on these kinds of causes and effects is a characteristic of
mechanistic explanations of the world, which became widespread in the
17th century. See, for a historical perspective and many valuable insight,

It may seem that I am conflating here determinism and predictability,
something which philosophers are always warning us not to do (Refs. 9
and 10). The question is subtle, but I believe it is certainly legitimate to
ask for evidence from any model that calls itself deterministic before we
lend it any credence. Otherwise, we might as well believe that everything
that happens in the universe is determined by invisible causes of which we
cannot know anything. Of course, we may want to cut our physical theories some slack: There may be many cases where exact prediction is an
extremely challenging mathematical problem, but we otherwise have no
reason to doubt the underlying model, because it has proved itself sufficiently (through verifiable predictions) elsewhere. On the other hand, an
impossibility to come up with verifiable predictions in practice by a model
that calls itself deterministic may also be an indication that this particular
model has reached the limits of its applicability. This is, in my opinion,
the case of so-called “deterministic chaos” the moment an accurate prediction requires the initial conditions to be specified to greater precision than
allowed by quantum mechanics (see Sec. IV C).

In fact, Newton’s theory was criticized in his time by no less than Leibnitz
and Huygens for not being “mechanistic” enough on this point! See S.
Psillos and S. Ioannidis, “Mechanisms, Then and Now: From Metaphysics
to Practice,” in the book cited in Ref. 14.
17
According to Section 2 of Ref. 6, this has been used in philosophy to argue
against the usefulness of the notion of cause itself. If so, this seems like
backwards reasoning to me. The world as we experience it is timeasymmetric. If our notion of cause reflects this, and our physical theories
do not, this is rightfully a problem for our physical theories, not the other
way around.

The general question of “mechanistic” explanations in science is currently
the subject of an active debate. According to the article cited in Ref. 16,

me in response to my action, quantum mechanics can tell me nothing more
than the probability of the response I can expect: the world’s reaction to
my action is the world’s free choice.” While this was written from the perspective of one specific interpretation of quantum mechanics (QBism), it
may be taken to apply in the “standard” (Copenhagen) interpretation as
well.

In a class by itself is the Everettian, or “many-worlds” interpretation,

single possible outcome is actually realized in one of a multitude of
“worlds” that come into being whenever a system in a state such as Eq. (6)
is “observed.” (Depending on the interpretation, these may be either true
physical or purely “mental” worlds.) As these worlds are, by assumption,
inaccessible to each other, this, the only truly deterministic prediction of
the theory, is neither verifiable nor disprovable. Within the single-world
perspective that is the only one available to any observer, it remains a fact
that identically prepared systems will yield different, unpredictable results,
for which no causal explanation is given.

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy&

(Libre albedrío e (in)determinismo en el cerebro: un problema para la filosofía naturalizada)

University of Tyumen, Russian Federation

ABSTRACT: In this article we study the question of free will from an interdisciplinary angle, drawing on philosophy, neurobiology and physics. We start by reviewing relevant neurobiological findings on the functioning of the brain, notably as presented in (Koch, 2009); we assess these against the physics of (in)determinism. These biophysics findings seem to indicate that
neuronal processes are not quantum but classical in nature. We conclude from this that there is little support for the existence
of an immaterial ‘mind’, capable of ruling over matter independently of the causal past. But what, then, can free will be? We
propose a compatibilist account that resonates well with neurobiology and physics, and that highlights that free will comes in
degrees — degrees which vary with the conscious grasp the ‘free’ agent has over his actions. Finally, we analyze the well-known
Libet experiment on free will through the lens of our model. We submit this interdisciplinary investigation as a typical case of
naturalized philosophy: in our theorizing we privilege assumptions that find evidence in science, but our conceptual work also
suggests new avenues for research in a few scientific disciplines.
KEYWORDS: free will; consciousness; compatibilism; neuroscience; determinism; Libet experiment; naturalized philosophy; quantum mechanics.
RESUMEN: En este artículo estudiamos la cuestión del libre albedrío desde una perspectiva interdisciplinar, combinando filosofía, neurobiología y física. Comenzamos revisando hallazgos relevantes en neurobiología acerca del funcionamiento del cerebro, en
especial los presentados en (Koch, 2009); estos resultados son evaluados en relación con la física del (in)determinismo. Tales hallazgos en biofísica parecen indicar que los procesos neuronales no son de naturaleza cuántica, sino clásica. De aquí concluimos que hay
poco apoyo a la existencia de una ‘mente’ inmaterial, capaz de gobernar la materia independientemente del pasado causal. Pero, ¿en
qué puede consistir entonces el libre albedrío? Planteamos una propuesta compatibilista que concuerda con la neurobiología y la física, y en la que se destaca que el libre albedrío se da en grados, dependiendo de la comprensión consciente que el agente ‘libre’ tenga
de sus acciones. Finalmente, analizamos el famoso experimento de Libet sobre el libre albedrío desde la perspectiva de nuestro modelo. Presentamos esta investigación interdisciplinar como un ejemplo típico de filosofía naturalizada: en nuestro teorizar privilegiamos asunciones con apoyo en la evidencia científica, aunque nuestro trabajo conceptual también sugiere nuevos caminos para la investigación en varias disciplinas científicas.

1. Introduction
The belief that we are free-willed people, proudly capable of choosing between alternative options almost whenever we want —say between now lifting my left hand, or not doing so— is so deeply embedded in humans that most of them believe that questioning free
will is not even a serious pass-time. Interestingly enough, a handful of philosophers and scientists camp on the opposite position, and believe that free will is the ultimate chimera to
combat, the last illusion of human ‘exceptionality’ to be reduced to smithereens, just as Copernicus, Darwin, Freud and others did with other illusions.
In philosophy, the debate on free will is millennia-old; almost all philosophers of renown have expressed their thoughts on it. Two typical and opposing positions in philosophy are libertarianism and hard determinism (for general works focusing on philosophy,
cf. e.g. Pereboom, 1997; Walter, 2001; Dennett, 2003; Watson, 2003; Kane, 2005, 2012;
Mele, 2009; Fischer et al., 2007; Griffith, 2013). In essence, libertarians believe that we
have a free will and that free will is incompatible with determinism; hard determinists on
the other hand assume that physical or nomological determinism rules out free will. Determinists often conceive of the universe as a mechanical clockwork in which each particle
and each system, be it a photon, atom or neuron, is bound by laws of nature to behave in a
way that is predetermined, fixed, since the Big-Bang. Since our brain, the seat of our will, is
in the end a physical and a biological system, and since natural science leaves no room for
free will, or so it seems to the hard determinist, humans only feel free in an illusory manner.
There is a third, popular, position, termed compatibilism, which states that free will and
determinism are not in contradiction. For reasons explained below, the model of free will
we will favour in this article is compatibilist.
In neurobiology, a number of well-known and highly relevant experiments related to
free will exist, of which the most famous is Libet’s experiment (Libet, 1985); but a considerable amount of other sophisticated investigations have been conducted, both on humans
and animals (cf. e.g. Heisenberg and Wolf, 1984; Koch, 1999, 2009; Walter, 2001; Maye
et al., 2007; Soon et al., 2008; Brembs, 2011; Stern, 2017). Reading these works confers
the definite impression that neuroscientists (understandably) often draw conclusions from
their experiments without a full knowledge of either the philosophical debate or of the
physics debate on the matter. Sometimes they discard the philosophical debate as outdated
and superfluous (see e.g. Koch, 2009; Brembs, 2011), advocating for instance the construction of a ‘scientific concept of free will as a biological trait’ (Brembs, 2011).
Here we embrace the point of view that a better understanding of free will, notably
the high-level type of free will necessary for moral responsibility, needs to involve, to the
least, the disciplines of neurobiology, philosophy and physics. In physics, too, the question
of free will is highly debated (cf. e.g. the recent article by Nobel laureate Gerard ‘t Hooft
(2017)), and relates to the determinism versus indeterminism controversy in the quantum
realm12(cf. e.g. Wuethrich, 2011; Vervoort, 2013, 2019). This debate, famously initiated
by Einstein and Bohr, is continued today most vividly in the interpretation of Bell’s theo1

346

On the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics and quantum field theories the universe is ultimately indeterministic (so probabilistic). But this matter is highly debated within the quantum philosophy and quantum foundations community (Wuethrich, 2011; Vervoort, 2013, 2019).

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

rem. Bell’s theorem is generally believed to provide the strongest ‘purely physical’ argument
against determinism; but there is now a consensus that this argument is actually heavily
metaphysically tainted (cf. e.g. Wuethrich, 2011). Indeed, closer inspection shows that the
standard interpretation of Bell’s theorem as refuting determinism is based on the assumption that experimenters have ‘free will’ — precisely in the sense that their experimental
choices are not determined by hidden physical causes (Wuethrich, 2011; Vervoort, 2013,
2019; ‘t Hooft, 2017). But as many compatibilists have argued, free will can exist even if all
events, including experimental choices of physicists, are causally predetermined. So remarkably enough, it seems that the standard interpretation of Bell’s theorem against determinism smuggles in the assumption of no-determinism from the start. In sum, it is important
for the free will debate to realize that the foundations of quantum physics leave the dichotomy determinism versus indeterminism undecided. And yet, it has recently been argued
that, of both alternatives, determinism has the strongest explanatory power, in that it can
provide a coherent answer to questions for which indeterminism remains entirely silent
(Vervoort, 2019). This is, to us, an argument to seek for compatibilist models of free will.
Of course, many compatibilists do not need physics to find a series of arguments in favour
of determinism in philosophy or neuroscience. Let us here just note that the stakes are high
in physics too, since Bell’s theorem can be seen as an essential obstacle in the construction
of a ‘theory of everything’ (‘t Hooft, 2017). In order to debunk this obstacle, it is therefore important to provide arguments showing that free will makes sense also if the universe
would be fully deterministic after all; an effort to which we wish to contribute in this article.
In order to make our point that genuinely interdisciplinary work is needed for an integrated understanding of free will, we will start by scrutinizing in Section 2 recent neurobiological work, notably by Christof Koch (2009). The key question we wish to investigate in
Section 2 is: does neurobiology offer arguments in favor of determinism or rather indeterminism? We focus on Koch’s work in his (2009), not only because he is a recognized expert
on the matter, but also because he is already remarkably well-informed about the physics
debate (Koch is a physicist turned neurobiologist). However we will argue that his interpretation of neurobiological results presents lacunae in the philosophical and physical treatment of the matters he investigates; we will conclude, pace Koch, that the neurobiological
processes he considers bare a classic deterministic signature rather than an indeterministic quantum one (Section 2). Let us emphasize that Koch’s professional work is in the first
place of neurobiological order; we do of course not doubt the high quality of this scientific
work. In contrast to many or most of his colleagues from neurobiology, Koch is not a determinist. We believe it is fair to consider him a libertarian adhering to a type of mind-matter dualism, a position that is close to, e.g., the position promoted by Popper and Eccles in
their (1977), to whom Koch often refers (Eccles is a neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate). Of course, Popper and Eccles are in a long philosophical tradition here. In particular,
Koch believes in a mind that can somehow realize or ‘cause’ free actions; in any case he does
not exclude this option, and searches for experimental support for this idea. After critical
assessment of Koch’s interpretation of neurobiological data in his (2009), we attempt in
Section 3 to answer the question of what else could be the basis for free will, if not a mind
transcending the causal brain. We summarize in this Section the main ingredients of a minimal compatibilist model which we elaborated in detail elsewhere (Vervoort & ­Blusiewicz,
2020), and which draws on a biophilosophical account of consciousness developed by

Mahner and Bunge (1997). This model is analytically minimal in the sense that it aims to
identify the minimal set of necessary and sufficient conditions to term an act ‘free-willed’
or ‘free’.23Most of the ingredients of this model have been theorized before; it could be seen
as a condensed synthesis of previous compatibilist theories; yet, we push the analysis further in some respects (cf. Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020; and Section 3.) Our main goals in
the present article are 1) to apply our model to the paradigmatic Libet experiment on free
will, and 2) to briefly describe further avenues of research that are suggested by it, in neurobiology and computer science. Both these goals are pursued in Section 4. Another goal is, as
said, to scrutinize what we can learn from neurobiology regarding the (in)deterministic nature of brain processes (Section 2).
We thus submit this investigation as a typical problem of naturalized or naturalistic
philosophy. We not only borrow from natural science to inform our philosophical theorizing, but we also extract new avenues for further research in these sciences from our conceptual inquiry.
2. Neurobiology results, and their (in)deterministic interpretation
In this Section we summarize and comment on the experimental neurobiological findings reported in (Koch, 2009) and other works, related to the (in)deterministic nature of
neuronal processes. Koch in his (2009) searches for neurobiological properties that could
support the libertarian concept of ‘free mind’. This implies that the author needs to find
arguments for indeterminism in neurobiology (libertarians deny determinism and need indeterminism for their account); in other words for the hypothesis that some relevant neuronal processes escape from a clockwork causal structure of the brain and the universe. Let
us first scrutinize the experimental facts Koch reports (2009). Then we will focus on their
physical and philosophical interpretation.
2.1. Indeterminism in ionic channel currents
The units or bits of information on which neuronal communication is based are the socalled ‘spikes’, or rather ‘action potentials’ emitted by neurons. Spikes or action potentials
are trains of electric currents generated along the axons of the neurons. Neurobiological
research has found that spike currents are constituted of the combination of many thousands of smaller contributions, the latter being generated in microscopic ion channels that
pass through the axon membrane. Now, while the spikes are, in the terminology of Koch
(2009), “macroscopic, continuous and deterministic”, the smaller ionic currents are “microscopic, binary, and stochastic” (binary means fluctuating between ‘off’ (0) and ‘on’ (1),
and stochastic means probabilistic, or random, i.e. indeterministic). Thus, the probabilistic aspect of the ion currents resides here in the fact that the ‘on’ and ‘off’ domains arise in a
probabilistic manner in time: there is no regular pattern in them — as is obvious from, for
instance, the measured current profiles published in Koch (1999).

Our model is a two-component model. Distinguishing several components in free will is also done by
Walter (2001); both models can be fruitfully compared, as done in (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020).

Theoria, 2020, 35/3, 345-364

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

Could this aspect of probabilistic behaviour provide the element of indeterminism (in
our brain activity when making free choices) that the libertarian is looking for?
2.2. Indeterminism in spike frequency
A similar randomness occurs in the frequency of the action potentials. Koch (2009) reports on experiments in which a micro-electrode is implanted close to a particular neuron
in the cortex of a macaque monkey looking at a display of a randomly moving cloud of dots
(see also Koch, 1999). (This projection ensures that the neuron’s activity is reasonably constant over different experimental trials.) When the display is turned on, the neuron begins
to ‘fire’, i.e. to emit spikes, at a frequency that can be measured via the electrode. Now, over
different trials, the spikes are emitted in a random manner; more precisely, their temporal pattern varies unpredictably over the trials, but the average number of spikes remains
reasonably constant. So one can define a probability of spike frequency. Here is again an
indeterministic aspect of brain functioning and one can again ask: could this be the indeterminacy that allows our brain and our decision making to escape from the iron laws of biophysical determinism?
2.3. Indeterminism in fly behaviour
In the literature on the neurobiology of consciousness and free will, an important place is
occupied by research investigating the behavior of model animals, notably the fruit fly (the
famous and hard-working Drosophila melanogaster, inadvertently involved in the attribution of at least eight Nobel prizes). If the brains of flies were purely deterministic systems,
one could expect that elementary behaviour (say flying in a straight line) in an environment
presenting as little external stimuli as possible, would be very simple — say fully regular or
perhaps fully random (‘fully random’ means: all movements having equal4probability3).
Drosophila m. has decided otherwise: her behaviour appears to be highly complex, somewhere in between fully regular and fully random — she acts capriciously, ‘voluntarily’ as it
were. This is shown by well-known experiments in which fruit flies are tethered to a rigid
wire (receiving no visual impulses) and in which their ‘escape’ flights are registered while
the animal can only turn left or right (Heisenberg and Wolf, 1984; Maye et al., 2007). The
flies appear to execute stochastic saccades following a fractal pattern. In Koch’s words, “the
animal behaves neither completely randomly nor fully deterministically, but opts for something in between chance and necessity” (Koch, 2009, p. 45). This ‘spontaneous’ complex
behaviour is typically interpreted as (an embryonic form of) voluntary behaviour (Koch,
2009, p. 45) — where we wish to remark that the concept of voluntariness is indeed closely
related to that of free will, but that it is nonetheless far from easily definable, as will be seen
in the next Section.

3

Fully random behaviour would reflect the fact that in experiments the flies are exposed to no structured external (visual) stimuli — in physical terms: only white noise (white noise is unstructured randomness). If the brain were a simple deterministic input/output box, then ‘randomness in’ would
cause ‘randomness out’. But things are not as simple.

2.4. Determinism in Libet-like experiments
Koch interprets the well-known neurobiological result of Libet (1985), which we will consider in greater detail in the last Section, as indicating that “the brain can make a simple decision well before the conscious mind does; this observation reveals the experience of willing an action to be secondary to the actual cause” (Koch, 2009, p. 49). ‘The actual cause’
is the working of the brain. This is a quite standard interpretation — an interpretation
that, as Koch concedes, is rather in agreement with determinism than with indeterminism.
Modern versions of this experiment have confirmed Libet’s work based on electroencephalography (EEG, e.g. Haggard and Eimer, 1999). A considerably more sophisticated technique, fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), has been used in experiments by
e.g. Soon et al. (2008). These researchers monitored the brain activity of test persons who
were asked to flex either their left or their right hand. Soon et al. reported that, by screening their hemodynamic activity in the parietal and prefrontal cortex, their choice could be
predicted 8 seconds prior to the onset of movement45(!). Once more, there is a long time
span of brain activity before the conscious choice is made.
Let us now scrutinize Koch’s and other typical interpretations of these scientific results. First of all, it should be noted that many philosophers agree that fundamental randomness, or fundamental indeterminacy, is, in itself, not a hallmark of free decisions (cf. e.g.
Pereboom, 1997; Walter, 2001; Dennett, 2003; Griffith, 2013). The argument generally
used against the idea that indeterminism alone can ground free will is the so-called ‘luck
argument’: if my actions are the result of an indeterministic process occurring in my brain
that might very well not have occurred, it is hard to see how these actions are under my
control and up to me (libertarians may contest this conclusion). At any rate, we take it that
a libertarian, more precisely a ‘libertarian à la Koch’, looks for neuronal processes in humans that satisfy at least two criteria, L1 and L2, namely neuronal processes that:
L1) escape from the straightjacket of determinism, and at the same time,
L2)  can be somehow (freely and consciously) ‘influenced by the mind’ (cf. e.g. Koch,
2009, p. 49) or ‘controlled by the mind’ (e.g. Koch, 2009, p. 41).
It is clear from Koch’s article that he focuses on the case of an immaterial mind (see e.g.
Koch, 2009, p. 41, where he compares the mind to a ‘metaphysical ectoplasm’). What do
biology and physics tell us about these requirements or hypotheses?
As exemplified by the results 2.1-2.3, there indeed exist indeterministic neuronal processes that are or could be at the basis of our conscious behaviour (L1). But physicists immediately add that the indeterminism of these specific processes corresponds to classical
randomness, not quantum randomness (this is acknowledged by Koch). This is essential,
because classical randomness is usually seen as deriving from deterministic, even if unpredictable, processes. Only quantum indeterminacy is genuine, irreducible randomness, which
cannot be reduced to underlying deterministic processes. Regarding empirical result 2.1,
Koch (2009, p. 43) says: “Given the large size of channel proteins […] it is generally believed that the stochastic character of ionic channels can be entirely explained by thermal
fluctuations and does not rely on quantum indeterminacy […]”. And regarding 2.2, the

Some authors, however, criticize this result by pointing out that, depending on experimental conditions, the predictions were only correct with a certain probability, not necessarily clearly significant.

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

randomness and variability of action potentials of individual neurons: “Some of this variability is due to trembling eyes, the exact timing of the heartbeat, breathing, and so on.
The remaining unpredictability is thought to be accounted for by the incessant movement
of the molecules, primarily water, making up the wet and warm brain — thermal motion
[…]. This ceaseless motion cannot be predicted but is still subject to the laws of cause and
effect. Biophysicists by and large believe that quantum mechanics has no essential role to
play here. While nervous systems —like anything else— obey quantum mechanics, the collective effects of all these molecules frenetically moving about is to smear out any quantum indeterminacy. At the cellular level, neurons look to be firmly governed by classical
physics” (2009, p. 43-44). This analysis is indeed in full agreement with what for instance
quantum condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry teach us, namely that quantum coherence and quantum phenomena in general are destroyed when atoms or molecules are brought to temperatures above say liquid-nitrogen temperatures (an icy 77 Kelvin
or –196º Celsius) — when thermal kinetic effects tune in. Something similar is true for the
stochastic saccades following a fractal pattern observed on fruit flies (result 2.3): fractals are
typically explained by the theory of non-linear systems, or deterministic chaos (Maye et al.,
2007).
So, neuronal phenomena 2.1-2.3 are usually understood as deriving from classic deterministic processes, but at the same time they are unpredictable. This brings us to the heart
of Koch’s analysis in his (2009). Indeed, on closer inspection, Koch takes the unpredictability of brain activity, well-illustrated by 2.1-2.3, as the key guarantee for the possibility of
free will. He stresses on p. 45: “Your actions are not, and never will be, predictable. Even
though the universe and everything within it obeys natural laws, the state of the future
world is contingent in a way that, in general, cannot be computed from its current state”.
Now, there is little doubt that the detailed time-behaviour of ion channel currents, as
well as of action potentials, as well as the features of many other (individual or collective)
brain processes will for ever elude human prediction — we have, alas or luckily, too limited cognitive and epistemic means at our disposal for that. This unpredictability-in-practice is universally acknowledged in physics and philosophy. However, it is not considered a
challenge to fundamental determinism, in other words, it does not amount to an (L1)-type
argument for libertarianism. As recalled above in criterion (L1), a libertarian can only interpret genuinely indeterministic neuronal activity as a basis for free will, not ‘just’ unpredictable activity.56Most unpredictable systems in physics are still deterministic, deterministic chaos as reported in result 2.3 being the paradigm example. Only genuine quantum
processes could satisfy (L1); but there is no evidence for these in the working of neurons. In
sum, the unpredictability to which Koch points is decidedly not enough.
Koch seems to be aware of this problem for his account, since at times he speculates on
the possibility that there still could exist relevant quantum processes in the brain. Let us
bear with the author and concede this point: that it still might be possible, against the odds,
that future biophysical research will find evidence for a truly quantum, irreducibly indeterministic process involved in conscious brain activity. Koch envisages the following possibility (2009, p. 40): “What cannot be ruled out is that tiny quantum fluctuations deep in the

A libertarian assumes that genuine alternatives are open to the mind, and therefore needs to find arguments against the single-track necessity of determinism.

brain are amplified by deterministic chaos and will ultimately lead to behavioral choices.
This is the basis of Jordan’s quantum amplifier hypothesis of free will […]. The release of a
single synaptic vesicle may be dependent on some pre-synaptic quantum event. This might
generate an action potential in the post-synaptic neuron that, in turn, triggers a cascade of
active neurons that ultimately give rise to movement.” This eighty-year-old ‘quantum amplifier’ hypothesis is indeed well-known, and was proposed by one of the founding fathers
of quantum theory, the German physicist Pascual Jordan (Jordan, 1938).
Let us assume, for the time being, that the quantum amplifier hypothesis satisfies requirement (L1). What about (L2)? Are there neurobiological indications that an immaterial mind could somehow control quantum processes (or processes generated by quantum processes)? Koch speculates (2009, p. 41-42): “The only freedom that such a mind
could have is to realize one quantum-mechanical event rather than another one as dictated
by Schrödinger’s law. Say, for example, that at a particular point in time and at a particular
synapse in cortex, a superposition of two quantum mechanical states occurs. There is a 10%
chance that the synapse will switch —sending a chemical signal across the cleft separating
two neurons— and a 90% chance that nothing happens. […] Given our present interpretation of quantum mechanics, it cannot be ruled out that the conscious mind could exploit this idiosyncratic freedom. It is powerless to change these probabilities —that would
cost energy— but it might be able to decide what happens on any one trial. […] We do not
know whether this is even within the realm of the possible. But at least it cannot be ruled
out”. The ‘idiosyncratic freedom’ Koch refers to is the capacity of the mind to choose between quantum states in superposition (while leaving the experimentally verifiable probabilities unaltered).
We fear however that the possibility that Koch envisages here runs more against what
physics teaches us than he claims. Quantum processes are indeed probabilistic and it is fully
legitimate to assume that they are characterized by several outcomes or states (say switching
or not switching, as above) and that these states arise each with a certain probability. However, physics offers no support for the idea that ‘something immaterial’ could influence a
quantum system in the brain and cause it to assume a certain state rather than another one.
Indeed, to cause a quantum system to assume a state (in physics terms: to cause the wave function to collapse on some state) amounts to an interaction, and interactions inevitably cost
energy. But the principle of conservation of energy applied to the brain, in other words the
energy balance of the brain, does not leave room for such an extraneous immaterial agent —
the energy balance of the material brain is in equilibrium. Therefore, the (L2)-type of argument Koch invokes —the possibility of an immaterial substance choosing among quantum
states— contradicts one of the most fundamental laws of nature, namely the energy conservation principle.67This adds of course to the fact that, till date, there is no other biological nor
physical evidence that could back-up the existence of a mind beyond the brain. To be fair, we
should remark that Koch is himself all but adamant in defending his mind-model; he seems
well aware that it remains, from a scientific perspective, a highly speculative option.
Let us now draw our conclusion, based on the neurobiological data and models presented by Koch and others. We believe it is fair to say that there exists, till date, no suffi6

352

Somewhat surprisingly, at times Koch seems to be aware of this fact: see his correct observations on the
principle of energy conservation (Koch, 2009, p. 41).

cient neurobiological nor physical evidence to support the idea of libertarianism based on
(L1) (in short, quantum indeterminacy) and (L2) (in short, a controlling mind). As neurobiologists and biophysicists have argued, neuronal systems are too large and too hot for
quantum effects to survive; and the arguments for an immaterial mind that could control
quantum states seem even more doubtful to us. Also, the experiments performed by Libet
and others (e.g. Soon et al., 2008, findings 2.4 above) are usually interpreted as in agreement with determinism rather than with indeterminism (of course, libertarians have contested this conclusion, since this is a debatable matter).
Guided by the above conclusions, as well as by philosophical arguments (notably the
mentioned ‘luck argument’) and by physics results (Vervoort, 2013, 2019), we will adopt in
the following a deterministic or rather compatibilist position on free will. We have elaborated our compatibilist model of free will elsewhere (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020). Let us
summarize and illustrate our findings in the next Section, and then show in Section 4 how
they deal with Libet’s experiment and which avenues of research they suggest.
3. A minimal compatibilist model of free will: the CMT model
Let us first state our main background assumptions. First of all, we adhere in the following to ‘materialist-emergentist realism’ essentially as it is expounded in (Walter, 2001) and
in most detail in (Mahner and Bunge, 1997); for a summary see (Vervoort & Blusiewicz,
2020, Section 5). This implies in particular that we assume that mental activity is brain
activity: our thoughts, beliefs, choices, feelings etc., have a neurological, and ultimately
chemical-physical basis in the brain; mental states correspond to neural (super)networks,
mental acts are brain processes. As recalled in (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020), we follow
Mahner and Bunge in their characterization of the ‘mind’ (of agent A) as a conceptual object, namely the union, or set, of all mental processes of the brain of A (Mahner and Bunge,
1997, p. 205). Further, this view implies, notably, that: “There can be no mind-matter interaction because —unlike individual mental processes and brains— mind and matter are
sets, hence conceptual objects. However, it does make sense to speak of ‘mental-bodily interactions’ provided this expression is taken to abbreviate ‘interactions among plastic neuronal systems, on the one hand, and either committed neuronal systems or bodily systems
that are not part of the Central Neuronal System on the other’ (Mahner and Bunge, 1997,
p. 205).
Next, we follow in this article most philosophers in the assumption that ‘free will’ is
‘free will necessary for moral responsibility’ (note that the present article is about free will,
not moral responsibility; but for completeness we present a concise view on the latter concept in the Appendix). Thus the free will we study here is ‘more’ than animal free will, if
such a thing exists. But let us immediately add: from a neurobiological point of view, it is
natural to assume that if something like free will exists, there should be a smooth evolutionary transition from an embryonic form of free will in animals to a higher-grade species in
humans (cf. e.g. Brembs, 2011). As we will see in a moment, the conceptual model of free
will we proposed in (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020) allows for this smooth evolution.
In philosophy, a position intermediate between libertarianism and hard determinism, called compatibilism, assumes that free will and determinism are not in contradiction
(for a general introduction, cf. e.g. Ayer, 1954/1997; Pereboom, 1997; Walter, 2001; Denhttps://doi.org/10.1387/theoria.21302

nett, 2003; Griffith, 2013). Many and perhaps a majority of philosophers studying free
will are compatibilists (Pereboom, 1997, p. 242). Let us immediately clarify: the free will
of the compatibilist model presented below is not the absolute free will of an independent
mind or agent in which a libertarian à la Koch believes — a mind or agent with the capacity to choose between genuine alternatives independently of prior causes. If determinism is
true, such ontologically fundamental alternatives do not exist, as already argued by Spinoza.
But what could then be this type of free will that is compatible with determinism? This remains an open question in philosophy, but it appears that a thorough literature search and
a synthesis of popular, cogent theories brings us quite far. This is essentially what we did
in (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020); there we argue that our model solves problems of other
theories, so that we can have a relative confidence in it.
Many compatibilists agree that an essential ingredient of free-willed actions is the condition that they are not compelled by an external agent (see e.g. Ayer, 1954/1997; this idea
traces back to Aristotle, Hobbes and others). But even more essential is, as realized already
by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, that a free-willed act should be voluntary. To analyze the complex concept of voluntariness we relied on a detailed neurobiological theory
developed in Mahner and Bunge (1997). Without going in details, voluntary can be analyzed as purposeful and conscious; and for consciousness Mahner and Bunge propose following definition (in a slightly modified phrasing, cf. Mahner and Bunge, 1997 p. 209):
DEF-1. A conscious mental process / choice / act (conceived as based on, governed by, a mental process) is a mental process / choice / act that is monitored (recorded, analyzed, controlled, or
kept track of) by some other mental activity in the same brain.

In other words, in essence: for a mental process or act to be conscious, it must be thought
about by a higher-level part of the brain, typically thought of as being localized in the prefrontal cortex. This leads then to following definition of a free act (Mahner and Bunge,
1997; Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020):
DEF-2. Action A by animal b is ‘free-willed’ or ‘free’ (is made of b’s own free will) IFF
ii. the action A is unconstrained (no programmed or external compulsion), and
ii. the action A is purposeful and conscious in that the action (linked to a mental process) is
monitored (recorded, analyzed, controlled, or kept track of) by some other mental activity
in the brain of b.

Clause (i), no programmed or external compulsion, refers to the absence of direct or programmed constraint by external agents (as well as of pathological or compulsory internal
constraint, see e.g. Ayer, 1954/1997). For the following, it is condition (ii) that will be seen
to be essential.
But now we can, it seems, go further in our conceptual analysis.78How, by what means,
does the brain ‘monitor’ (i.e. record, analyze, control, or keep track of) mental activities as
ideas, perceptions etc.? In (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020) we propose that this monitor7

354

Pushing this analysis further is necessary to allow our model to interact more fruitfully with special
sciences, including proposing new experiments, notably in neurobiology and computer science (see the
last Section).

Theoria, 2020, 35/3, 345-364

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

ing always involves some assumptions, beliefs, worldviews or other cognitive tools (besides
perhaps other brain states). For instance, when ‘freely’ deciding which suit to choose to go
to work, I may ‘assume’ or I may ‘use the belief’ or ‘be in the belief’ that suit A is more appropriate for today’s work than suit B. Or when deciding of my own free will to help my
neighbor, I may base my decision on the worldview or ‘theory’ that altruism is a source of
fulfillment, or on the simple belief that the act will be rewarded by something much more
mundane — say a babble plus beer. It seems that the more intellectually demanding the
context is, the more elaborate the assumptions I adopt are: in some cases these better be
part of a well-grounded theory. For instance, when a spaceship commander decides in an
unforeseen situation to freely press the ‘full power’ button at a precise time, he hopefully
does so on the basis of assumptions that take serious calculations and relativistic mechanics into account. (If he does not, and hits the button in a panicky reflex, one hesitates to call
his act genuinely free — in agreement with almost all philosophical models.) In the following we use ‘theory’ in a very broad sense, including high-level theories (ethical, philosophical, sociological, political, physical…) but more generally also assumptions; beliefs systems,
including every-day beliefs and hypotheses; bodies of information; worldviews; etc. In
(Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020) we introduced ‘theory*’ to define theory in this broad sense;
we could equally well have used ‘assumptions*’ or ‘beliefs*’.89Now, it seems that one always
monitors, analyzes and controls an act, choice or decision with reference to, or within, a theory*, as illustrated by the above examples. In sum, high-level free acts, when non-trivial intellectual or ethical deliberation is asked, involve conscious monitoring by means of assumptions, beliefs or theories. This is the key new ingredient of our model. But this ingredient still
needs to be supplemented with following stipulation.
Indeed, the theories* involved in monitoring an act are more or less ‘adequate’. One
ponders about a choice using beliefs that may be ill-guided or solid, (more or less) rational
or irrational; and in non-trivial situations the whole art of making adequate free decisions
amounts, according to our model, to using adequate assumptions, beliefs or theories. This
interpretation comes close to what Kant thought about free will in his Foundations of the
Metaphysics of Morals. There he states: “a free will and a will under moral laws become one
and the same” (Kant, 1786/1983 BA98). For Kant, real free will is, in essence, will under
moral law. Translated in the language of our model: will in accordance with (monitored,
controlled by) adequate moral assumptions / theories*.

8

Perhaps the most essential reason why we introduce the convention ‘theory*’ rather than ‘assumption*’
or ‘belief*’ is that, when relating our account to computer science, it appears clearly more instrumental
to focus on theories. So the concept ‘theory*’ allows us to interface with computer science in a much
more relevant way: see the last Section. Moreover, we believe it is important to make a distinction between what could be termed ‘simple’ or ‘elementary’ beliefs (e.g. linked to perceptions), and beliefs
that involve diverse or elaborate cognitive elements (or elaborate mental content) such as theories. In
cognitively demanding contexts, an agent cannot monitor a choice through the lens of a simple belief,
but needs a whole theory —or many coherent beliefs— to assess a situation. Further, we know since
Quine and his holism that statements, at least somewhat complicated ones, in any case scientific ones,
do usually not get their meaning ‘in isolation’ but through interconnection with a net of statements
(so diverse mental content) — a theory* in our jargon. One might say: for complicated free decisions,
an agent may need to integrate several beliefs (constituting a coherent whole).

A relevant feature of the CMT model is that it is in agreement with the idea that free
will comes in degrees.9As said, within a neurobiological conception of free will there certainly is room for variations in free will, as has been argued by neurobiologists (Brembs,
2011). Indeed, if such a thing as free will exists, then we arguably do not possess it as a foetus, but we gradually acquire it with age and cognitive evolution. The variability of free will
can also be understood, within a neurobiological perspective, as a direct consequence of the
fact that we descended from animals that had, at best, an embryonic form of free will; ours
evolved in parallel and gradually with our cognitive capacities. This is well reflected in our
model: according to it, the variability of free will resides, notably, in the degree of adequacy of
the assumptions* we use to consciously monitor and guide our actions; so in their (cognitive
and practical) efficiency (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020). It seems clear that low-level animals are devoid of this form of free will; but it is highly likely that in primates some elementary forms of consciousness exist, as an evolutionary base for human consciousness. In our
model this embryonic consciousness comes down to a capacity to guide actions through
some elementary form of ‘beliefs’ or ‘assumptions’. Therefore we suggest it would be interesting to search for the neuronal correlates for ‘assumptions’ in primates (one conjectures
that they are related to memory-circuits, or to the ‘mirror neurons’ that have become fashionable lately10).
We can wrap-up above considerations in the final definition that summarizes our
model (cf. Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020):
DEF-3. Action A by animal b is ‘free-willed’ or ‘free’ (is made of b’s own free will)
IFF
ii. the action A is unconstrained (no programmed or external compulsion), and
ii. the action A is conscious in that the action (linked to a mental process) is monitored (recorded, analyzed, controlled, or kept track of) by some other mental activity in the brain
of b. The latter monitoring occurs through theories*, which have a varying degree of adequacy (cf. explanation in text).

For examples how to apply this definition to concrete cases, we refer to the last Section (see
notably how we treat the example involving Alice and Bob) and to the original (Vervoort
& Blusiewicz, 2020). In the latter article we have shown that our model, which we term the
CMT model (for free-willed as ‘conscious-through-monitoring-through-theories*’) can
be related to, and solve problems of, several recent compatibilist theories, notably those of
Frankfurt (1969, 1988), Wolf (1990), and Fischer and Ravizza (Fischer and Ravizza, 1998;
Fischer et al., 2007). Let us consider one example from (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020). In
Frankfurt’s ‘hierarchical mesh theory’ of free will (1969, 1988) an action or choice A is free
if it meshes with a ‘second-order volition’ — a higher desire about the first-order desire to
do A. Then A is really (rationally) desired, in agreement with one’s second-order (rational)

This idea is not new in the philosophy literature. It is for instance elaborated upon in an interesting
manner in (O’Connor, 2009). Here we propose a related but still different account of the origin of the
variability of free will.
It is interesting that these mirror neurons are the base for the ‘theory of mind’ that neurobiologists
have attributed to primates as the cognitive base for recognizing the ‘self’ and ‘the other’.

desires; action A flows from the ‘will one wants’ — a reflective capacity animals likely do
not have. As argued in (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020), there surely is a relevant connection
between Frankfurt’s theory and the CMT model: one may consider that second-order volitions are part of the general beliefs, worldviews etc. that an agent uses to guide and control
her life and actions. Action A meshes with a second-order volition in that it is consciously
monitored by (assessed, analyzed etc.) with help of a worldview, a belief system, assumptions of life, in other words theories*. So both models converge, but ours is not afflicted for
instance with the well-known infinite-regress problem of Frankfurt’s; and ours can treat
a case as brainwashing, again a threat to Frankfurt’s theory (for a recent overview and references, see Griffith, 2013, Ch. 4). A girl Trina brainwashed by her community to believe
that stealing is commendable may well act in accordance with higher volitions, really believe in what she does, and therefore be entirely free according to Frankfurt’s model — a
conclusion most people would disagree with. The CMT model solves this problem: Trina
is brainwashed and therefore not unconstrained; and she monitors (assesses) her deeds
through questionable, likely inadequate beliefs. In other words, one could say she has a limited or corrupted form of free will (Vervoort & Blusiewicz, 2020).
A last property of the CMT model that deserves remembering is that it is compatible with a deterministic picture of the world. Indeed, even if all events, systems and properties of physical or biological or other nature were ultimately governed by iron deterministic
laws, leaving no room to chance, free will could still exist — namely as a capacity of agents
to act as defined by DEF-3. Indeed, even if we were living in a deterministic universe, an
agent can act without being constrained by other agents, and monitor her acts through
conscious theories*. Of course, the acquisition or adoption or application of beliefs, assumptions etc. will, in a deterministic picture, be the result of predetermined processes, mediated through genetics, education, social background, life-changing encounters etc. — in
any particular case by a potentially quasi-infinite number of particular causes (let us term
this claim ‘source determinism’). But this is clearly not in opposition with the fact that one
can evaluate an act through the lens of clauses (i) and (ii) in DEF-3, and judge whether it
is free in that sense. Note, and this is interesting, that our model can also survive in an indeterministic universe! Also in that case one can evaluate an act according to (i) and (ii). So,
our model could perhaps also appeal to libertarians and be used by them (but they would
want to add something to it). But the model jibes best with a deterministic stance on free
will. Indeed, the deterministic picture is the simplest: it does not need to invoke an ‘agent’
or ‘mind’ or other substance that would causally control a person’s acts; in the deterministic picture acts are causally controlled by a person’s beliefs, assumptions (cf. clause (ii)) —
something cognitive—, where this cognitive thing (neural nets ultimately) is itself part of a
deterministic causal chain. But these neural nets are still in the brain of some agent; agency
comes back in in this way.
In any case, a comprehensive analysis of free will demands a commitment to either determinism or indeterminism, as we will argue below. Therefore, to be precise, let us explicitly add the following ingredient to the CMT model as a compatibilist model. We do not
simply assume that determinism and free will are not in contradiction (on the logical level)
as all compatibilists do; we assume moreover that both exist in this world. Many contemporary compatibilist philosophers make no ontological commitments; but we need to do
so when interpreting neurobiology and real-world cases. One could call this a form of ‘ontic compatibilism’ or ‘soft determinism’. We prefer the former, new term to emphasize the

perspectival dimension of this position (‘soft determinism’ is already used and does not
explicitly contain this dimension). Indeed, one can look at problems of free will, agency,
moral responsibility etc. through the lens of a theory of free will, but at the same time one
should not forget, according to our ontic compatibilism, to analyze things through the
lens of determinism. This position, intimately linked to (versions of) perspectivism, surely
has been advocated in the history of philosophy. In sum, our model of free will, the CMT
model, has three essential characteristics, namely DEF-3, featuring notably the assumption
that the monitoring (analyzing, controlling) by the conscious brain involves assumptions,
beliefs, theories*; the hypothesis that free will comes in degrees (this is actually already explicit in clause (ii) of DEF-3); and ontic compatibilism.
4. Libet’s experiment and the CMT model. Conclusions
We have analyzed in this article neurobiological results related to free will as reviewed in
(Koch, 2009); more precisely results on the (in)deterministic nature of neuronal properties that can be analyzed in physical terms, namely ionic channel currents, spike frequency, and fly behaviour (cf. Section 2, findings 2.1-2.3). In Section 2 we came to the
conclusion that the biophysical processes involved do not provide evidence for genuine
(quantum) indeterminacy. This is one of the reasons why we expressed a preference for
a compatibilist model of free will, as sketched in the previous Section (one can also invoke philosophical and even physical arguments, cf. Vervoort, 2019). Even if all neuronal
activity is based on deterministic (even if in practice unpredictable) processes, as present-day scientific research seems to privilege, the CMT model sketched above is compatible with that reality, and leaves room for (some form of) free will. But as noted, the core
of the CMT model (DEF-3) would also survive if free decisions would involve indeterministic processes, after all.
Let us, then, have a closer look at Libet’s experiment and its modern variants. In this
experiment an EEG scan is made on the scalp of a test person. Such an EEG monitors the
so-called ‘readiness potential’, which is an electrical signal (often called ‘brain waves’), expressed in Volts, that results from firing neurons. Every voluntary action, such as the flexing of a hand, induces such a slowly rising electrical potential. In Libet’s experiment the test
persons are asked to spontaneously lift or flex their hand, whenever they feel like it, and
note the time when they make this ‘free’ decision. The experimental set-up is such that test
persons can quite precisely identify this decision time (they look at a screen with a bright
point moving on a circle, a clock, and can thus simply report the position of the pointer);
the actual time of movement can be measured electrically with high precision; both times
coincide quite well. As is well-known, the at-the-time quite spectacular result reported by
Libet was that the EEG showed that the brain activity started almost half a second before
the time at which the test person consciously decided to move. In Koch’s words: “What became apparent was that the beginning of the readiness potential preceded the conscious decision to move by [between] 0.3 and 0.5 sec. That is, the brain acted before the conscious
mind did! This is a complete reversal of the deeply held intuition of mental causation —
your brain and your body only act after your mind wills it” (2009, p. 46). Experiments like
these have been confirmed by others; and one has to add to these findings the even more
spectacular experiments by researchers as Soon et al. (2008).

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

Many, and probably most neurobiologists are inclined to believe that these findings
undermine the idea that humans have a free will. What is the verdict of the CMT model?
The precise question is: is the test persons’ act of flexing their wrist ‘free’ (at the decision
time)? Applying our model is straightforward here: at the decision time the test person is
not constrained (condition (i) is satisfied) and she is clearly conscious of her act (condition (ii) is satisfied) — hence her act is free, after all, according to our model. (Before the decision time the act is unconscious and therefore not free; but that seems uncontroversial.)
Of course, deciding to flex a hand in a Libet experiment is almost a reflex-like act; therefore
the ‘assumptions’ accompanying this kind of conscious decision are surely minimal and not
particularly rationalized.11 But let us recall that free will comes in degrees; some acts involve
a higher level or simply a different kind of consciousness than others; one could therefore
say that the type of free will exerted by the test persons in flexing their hand is of a ‘minimal’ type. Also, the steady rise in readiness potential that is measured in Libet’s experiment
might be paralleling precisely this rise of awareness, of consciousness that an act is done —
in agreement with our model.
Thus, on the CMT model, the test person in the Libet-experiments is free at the moment of conscious choice, even if this conscious and free act may well be determined by
previous causes — as the neurobiological data suggest. In other words, Libet-like experiments do not exclude a compatibilist conception of free will. This conclusion is in line
with compatibilist ideas12 — it is on the other hand at odds with what many neuroscientists believe. However, our model allows to go further in the analysis. As will be no surprise, to that end it is instrumental to look at actions that are more complex, cognitively
speaking, than the wrist flexing used in Libet’s experiment. Let us look at a somewhat subtle test case. Imagine a family that has since generations amassed considerable wealth. Suppose that the two off-springs in the youngest generation of the dynasty, Alice and Bob,
are in a bitter fight since years about their heritage. Alice and Bob have been brought up
in a family that puts material wealth among the highest goods; they were under the constant influence of ideas, habits, events that expressed this ‘worldview’. (Although they
surely experienced the idiosyncrasies of this select micro-cosmos, they do not seem to suffer from any obvious, extreme psychopathological disorders.) Suppose further that Bob
wants to inherit alone his family’s wealth, and decides to shoot his sister (over the years he
has come to hate Alice, convinced as he is that she has tricked him out of a considerable
part of the heritage; he seems to have convinced himself of the idea that Alice somehow
deserves her fate). Suppose finally that Bob is also a drug addict, and that at the moment
11

12

The ‘assumptions’ may be related to the assumption/belief that “I am a test person and supposed to
flex”; to memories of former wrist flexing; to the memory or belief that the flexing can be done clockwise or counter-clockwise; etc.
For instance Ayer’s (1954/1997). Indeed, Libet’s test persons are not under external constraint (neither under pathological or compulsory internal constraint); hence free on Ayer’s model. Ayer famously
argues that free will should not be contrasted with determinism and causality, but with constraint
(Ayer, 1954/1997, p 115). See also Griffith’s monograph on free will (Griffith, 2013, p. 109): “RP
[readiness potential] onset could correlate with any number of things. It could be some sort of precursor to an intention. It could be a cause of an intention rather than an intension itself. This is important because it may not be problematic to think that our intentions have causes (you will recall that
most of the free will theories we have discussed allow for a causal chain)”.

of killing he is under influence, but still —at least partly— lucid. Is Bob’s killing an act of
free will?
On a straightforward application of the CMT model (DEF-3), Bob can be said to
have (a form of) free will. Indeed, Bob was not compelled by others in his decision making, or let us suppose so (clause (i) is satisfied); and he was guiding his act by some (more
or less) conscious thinking (clause (ii)). Now, as argued in Section 3, a richer perspective
can be given to this question by realizing that free will comes in degrees, and that the conscious monitoring of free acts is done within assumptions* or theories* having a degree of
adequacy. From this perspective, even without taking his drug use into account, the free will
of Bob may be said to be of a ‘corrupted’ type — at least if we agree that Bob’s belief that
“money is all what counts” and that “she deserves it” are not the most adequate theory* to
adopt.
But this is not all. Ontic compatibilism, the third main characteristic of our model, incites us to scrutinize Bob’s decisions through the lens of determinism. Determinism is not
only compatible with the two components of DEF-3, it is also at the source of these ingredients of free will (we termed this ‘source determinism’ above) — or so suspects the determinist. In Bob’s case it seems clear that there exist some drugs-mediated deterministic processes underlying his decision making. Even if one cannot fully analyze why Bob believed
what he believed (a great number of factors will have conditioned his beliefs, presumably
starting in childhood), it can be assumed that his drug abuse will have influenced (so partially determined) his assumptions and beliefs when deciding to murder his sister. For instance, a euphoric or ‘counterfactually confident’ person makes different decisions than a
normal person. So Bob’s drug use further distorted his free will through distorting his beliefs, assumptions and worldview; this is a free-will reducing factor that deterministically
underlies condition (ii) in DEF-3. His drugs use could also be seen as a deterministic freewill reducing factor for condition (i), if it leads to compulsory behaviour; and high-grade
free will is devoid of inner or programmed compulsion according to clause (i) (cf. e.g. Ayer,
1954/1997).
At the same time —and this surely is the counterintuitive part of our interpretation—,
according to the nomological determinism we favour, Bob had to do what he did — for each
and every one of his acts. When taking all physical data of the universe into account, sub
specie aeternitatis so to speak, he had no real choice (supposing determinism is true) — even
if to our and to his subjective minds this seems unbelievable at almost all instances of perceived choice. Similarly, on the interpretation of the neurobiological experiments of Section 2 we favour, there is little room for quantum indeterminacy in cognitive processes, and
even less for a mind determining quantum processes. On that interpretation, what neurobiology leaves us with are classic deterministic processes materialized through action potentials of active neurons. These neurobiological processes, causing some free act, are the material counterpart of ‘beliefs’ or ‘reasons’ that make us pick a choice, act a free act. In Bob’s
case these processes were moreover conditioned by drugs. (One could see this as a further
argument for determinism: if some decisions are ultimately depending on the deterministic
chemistry and physics of the brain — why not all?)
Therefore, to be precise, we should give a detailed answer to the question “had Bob
free will?”. All depends on what one calls free will. If the ultimate capacity of a mind exerting
power over the brain is meant, a mind that can thus genuinely choose between alternatives,
independently of the causal past, our answer is ‘no’ — at present we find little or no scien360

Theoria, 2020, 35/3, 345-364

Free will and (in)determinism in the brain: a case for naturalized philosophy

tific evidence for such a capacity. But if a CMT-type capacity is meant, a capacity to think
about one’s acts and thus to guide and control them, we believe the answer is ‘yes’. Our
analysis of the question of free will hints to a final conclusion that is quite close to what
philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, Kant and Spinoza taught us, namely that it is through
better understanding the world that we become freer beings.13 (Regarding the question
whether Bob was morally responsible: cf. the Appendix.)
As announced, one essential motivation we had for constructing an analytically minimal model of free will (DEF-3), is that we believe that it can be instrumental for guiding natural science research; it may suggest a number of avenues for research in neuroscience and computer science. Indeed, we conjecture that our model can be instrumental in
tackling questions related to consciousness — considered an essential but at the same time
highly elusive concept in neuroscience (e.g. Stern, 2017). Notably, our model could possibly conceptualize aspects of consciousness and free will that could have an empirical basis. We think here in the first place of the process of monitoring by a neuronal superstructure (presumably in the prefrontal cortex, or having an integrating ‘central unit’ there) that
should represent a theory*; and the neuronal correlates of embryonic forms of ‘beliefs’ or
‘assumptions*’ in primates. We suggest it would be interesting to investigate whether such
superstructures are active in decision making and conscious acts; and of which nature they
precisely are.
In computer science, in particular AI research, a much debated question is: can future
computers and robots be conscious and/or have free will? If possible at all, our model suggests that one of the key properties a computer or an artificial neural net should have to
emulate consciousness, or to approximately mimic it, is the capacity to ‘use’ higher-order
theories — and this notably includes the capacity to adequately apply theories to real-world
situations and to act accordingly. Some will conclude we are very far from this possibility.
This suggests the following line of research in computer science and AI: can machines learn
to acquire and use theories*, and which types and how?
Intriguingly, computer scientists and cognitive scientists have recently indeed proposed that mastering theories is a key goal for artificial intelligence (AI). Lake et al. (2017)
state in the abstract of their highly cited article:
“We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and
how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the
world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and
enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to
rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.”

So, developing the capacity to acquire and use theories is, according to these authors, the
most promising path that AI can take to emulate human cognition. Since we come to a
converging conclusion (about rational consciousness, arguably strongly related to cogni13

Of course, this research also suggests that concepts as blame, praise, desert, punishment, achievement,
pride, self-made man etc. need to be taken with a serious grain of salt, and actually seriously revised —
a topic for much more philosophy.

tion) from a very different angle, namely from philosophical research on the ancient question of free will, we submit this as a case of mutual corroboration.
In physics, finally, a compatibilist view on free will allows us to escape from Bell’s no-go
theorem, as argued in Section 1. This may be important, since (the usual interpretation
of) Bell’s theorem is an obstacle in the construction of a ‘theory of everything’ (‘t Hooft,
2017). We hope that we have hereby made a case for naturalized philosophy, by showing
how philosophy and natural sciences can interact in a bi-directional way.
Appendix. A few words on moral responsibility
Almost all philosophers agree that the concept of moral responsibility is closely related to
that of free will, and that free will is necessary for moral responsibility, but the precise link
is highly debated. We cannot elaborate in detail here on this link, but it seems that examples as Bob’s case force us to envisage following hypothesis: while free will comes in degrees,
moral responsibility is rather an all-or-nothing concept. (Sure, there may be a variability
and degree attached to moral responsibility too, but, as we will argue now, to a lesser extent than to free will.) From some point of view, moral responsibility is a concept that carries the idea of a status that a society of people attributes to each of its members in order
that it can function acceptably. On the CMT model, if there is no constraint, free will is
largely only depending on some capacity of the free-willed agent herself (namely to ‘CMT’).
But one may argue that moral responsibility seems rather like a status given by society. Indeed, in the literature moral responsibility is defined by such concepts as answerability, attributability, accountability (cf. e.g. Watson, 1996; Smith, 2012) — these all have a legalistic touch to them, while DEF-3 is devoid of such concepts. Free will is something one can
have on an island alone; the last man to live can have free will; but one hesitates to attribute moral responsibility to the last human in the universe — the last human can in any case
not be morally responsible with regard to another human. One is morally responsible with
regard to X (normally: other people, perhaps other living species); free will does not carry
this relativity. It thus seems that having moral responsibility normally involves taking society into account; having free will not necessarily, e.g. in morally neutral situations. To come
back to our starting point: we believe this is the reason why moral responsibility is rather an
all-or-nothing concept, much less a matter of degree than free will: society attributes it to
any agent as soon as she has just a little free will (just a little of the capacity to consciously
monitor acts). On this view, moral responsibility is attributed by implicit fiat of society,
not so differently as it attributes e.g. ‘citizenship of nation X’ — clearly an all-or-nothing
thing. A moderate hypothesis is the following: that the variability of moral responsibility
does not parallel that of free will. While an agent’s free will can in principle vary gradually
with time, act-by-act so to speak, an agent is morally responsible for his acts once and for
all, as soon as he has a minimum form of free will.
Hence our verdict: Bob in the above case study is morally responsible.

Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a widely used heuristic search algorithm. In modelbased reinforcement learning, MCTS is often utilized to improve action selection process. However,
model-based reinforcement learning methods need to process large number of observations during
the training. If MCTS is involved, it is necessary to run one instance of MCTS for each observation
in every iteration of training. Therefore, there is a need for efficient method to process multiple
instances of MCTS. We propose a MCTS implementation that can process batch of observations in
fully parallel fashion on a single GPU using tensor operations. We demonstrate efficiency of the
proposed approach on a MuZero reinforcement learning algorithm. Empirical results have shown
that our method outperforms other approaches and scale well with increasing number of observations
and simulations.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a core machine learning topic that is concerned with
how agents should perform actions in an environment in order to maximize the total
cumulative reward. The agent learns by interacting with the environment through trial
and error and uses feedback from its own actions and experiences. Its purpose is to find
optimal or nearly-optimal strategy that maximizes the reward function. This strategy is
referred to as policy. RL based methods has achieved outstanding accomplishments in a
number of domains, e.g., games [1,2], autonomous driving [3], UAVs [4–6], robotics [7],
and traffic signal control [8].
RL may be divided into two fundamental categories: model-free, and model-based.
Model-free approaches directly learns a value function or a policy by interacting with the
environment. Model-based RL uses model of environment in order to perform decision
making through planning. This model is commonly represented by a Markov decision
process (MDP) [9] consisting of two components: a state transition function, and a reward
function. MDP is widely used in artificial intelligence for modeling sequential decisionmaking scenarios with probabilistic dynamics [10–12].
One of the most employed planning techniques is Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS).
MCTS combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling [13]. It
is a well-established approach to look-ahead search in context of model-based RL to extend
and improve decision making process by building and traversing a tree. It was utilized in
AlphaGO [1], the first program to achieve superhuman performance in GO, and in many of
its successors [2,14,15].
MCTS is very challenging to parallelize due to its inherent sequential nature where
each rollout depends on the statistics computed from previous simulations [16]. This
problem is even more challenging when GPU architecture is involved. One of the problems
is the SIMD execution scheme within GPU which causes that a standard CPU parallel
implementation such as root-parallelism fail [17].

In this paper, we propose a parallel implementation that aims to evaluate multiple
unique MCTS trees and is fully implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). A
common way to use MCTS is to gradually build one large tree. This tree is continuously
used and updated for the needs of the task at hand. We focus on a different type of tasks,
namely tasks that need to evaluate a large number of unique trees instead of building one
tree gradually. We show that the GPU tensor implementation of MCTS is suitable for this
task and can outperform CPU and CPU-GPU implementations despite the atomic nature of
the operations in MCTS. As an example of such task, we present a model-based RL, which
was our prime motivation in developing this implementation. Here, a large number of
different states (observations) need to be evaluated in each training iteration. Each state
is represented as a root in a unique tree, which is then processed by MCTS. These trees
are built in order to obtain actual training data and are then discarded and rebuilt from
new states in a subsequent training iteration. Efficient generation and evaluation of new
trees during the training is the key to the performance of these methods. Therefore, our
implementation can dramatically speed up the training process through more efficient
evaluation of large number of observations.
To fully exploit GPU’s capabilities, an environment model should also be implemented
on the GPU. This is crucially important for overall GPU implementation of MCTS. Modelbased RL can be divided into methods with an explicitly given model and with a learned
model. For methods with an explicitly given model, the possibility of implementing the
model on GPU as well as its complexity is highly application dependent. In the case of
methods with a learned model, the feasibility and efficiency of the implementation depends
on the employed learning algorithm to learn model dynamics.
Inspired by the recent success of MuZero [2], we demonstrate efficiency of the proposed MCTS implementation on a MuZero algorithm. MuZero is a model-based RL method
that learns dynamics model within its search. We show that the proposed implementation
can be easily integrated with a learned dynamics model represented by deep neural network (DNN). Although in this paper we focus on a parallel implementation of MCTS in
conjuction with MuZero, our implementation is broadly applicable to all model-based RL
methods that utilized MCTS. The contribution of this work is the following:
•

•

We propose fully parallel GPU implementation of MCTS that can simultaneously
evaluate MCTS on large number of observations. We used number of observations
50 - 750 for our evaluation and show that the proposed method scales well with the
increasing number of observations. The code is available at https://github.com/
marrekb/MuZero (accessed on 11 December 2022).
We compare our method with existing MCTS implementations on a use case inspired
by the MuZero and Atari games domain. The choice of DNN architecture used
in RL agent is application dependent and have a significant impact on the overall
performance. Therefore, we also report results for setup without using DNN. A
pattern can be seen in the results which shows that the proposed method is the most
computationally efficient.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The upcoming Section 2 contains an
overview of related work. We discuss important role of MCTS in RL methods on example of
MuZero, and existing parallel approaches to MCTS. In Section 3 we describe our proposed
parallel implementation of MCTS. Section 4 is devoted to experiments and their evaluation.
We summarize our conclusions in Section 5.
2. Related Work
2.1. Mcts and Reinforcement Learning
RL agents are usually divided into two categories—model-based, and model-free. One
of the most important parts of model-based agents is the model of the environment. By
environment model, we mean a function that predicts the next state and reward given a
combination of the current state and action. In other words, the model allows inferences
to be made about how the environment will behave [18]. Therefore, these models are

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

frequently used for planning, e.g., in combination with MCTS. Agents such as AlphaGO
and AlphaZero use a given model of the environment in the form of game simulators to
achieve the best results. Other model-based agents such as MuZero, SimPLE [19], and
I2A [20] do not require a given model and instead incorporate a learned model into the
training procedure.
Model-free agents do not use a model of the environment, so they cannot reason about
how their environments will change based on a given state and action [18]. Model-free
agents rely on a trial-and-error approach. They tend to be easier to implement and tune.
Model-free agents are divided by their learning approach into Q-learning agents (e.g.,
DQN [21]) and policy optimization agents (e.g., A2C [22], PPO [23]).
In 2016, the algorithm AlphaGO defeated world champion Lee Sedol in game GO [1].
This event was another milestone in the dominance of artificial intelligence against human
players. Last generation of algorithms based on AlphaGO is MuZero. It is model-based
RL algorithm that combines MCTS and DNN [2]. It is useful in domain without own copy
of environment, e.g., domain of Atari games. Due to this approach, MuZero has achieved
SOTA results in several Atari games [24]. Atari games are often used as benchmarks for
RL algorithms [21,25]. In addition of Atari games, MuZero has been applied in real-world
tasks such as autonomous defense of SDN Networks [26] or air traffic optimization [27].
The DNN in MuZero consists of three connected components for representation,
dynamics and prediction. The representation function f r (o |θr ) takes past observation (e.g.,
the Go board or Atari screen) and transforms it into hidden state s. The hidden state s is a
representation of the real environmental state by DNN. Because we do not have a copy of
environment, we use hidden states in MCTS instead of environment observations.
Given a state st and an action at , the dynamics function f d (s, a|θd ) predicts an immediate reward R(st |θd ) and a new state st+1 . In each state, the prediction function f p (s|θ p )
proposes probability distribution of actions P(s, ·|θ p ) and state value V (s|θ p ). State value is
expected return of rewards from the current state.
MCTS is used to build tree of possible actions (represented as edges) and hidden
states (nodes) in order to support decision making process. Tree is build by process called
simulation. Simulation consists of four base MCTS phases (selection, expansion, simulation
and backpropagation). Each simulation explores existing tree, finds next unexplored
combination of state s and action a, and extends the tree by adding new node (state s).
Simulations are executed sequentially. One simulation consists of following phases:
•

•

•

•

Phase of selection—the tree is traversed from the root to find next unexplored combination of state and action. In each node (assigned to specific state), the edges (represent
actions) are chosen by the PUCT (Predictor + Upper Confidence Bound applied to
trees) (Equation (1)). PUCT represents trade-off between exploitation and exploration.
Exploitation is solved via q values. Q(st , a) is expected value of future rewards after
taking action a [18]. In our case, it could be computed as a sum of immediate reward
rt and state value of next state V (st+1 |θ p ) discounted by discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1]
(Equation (2)). In board games, rewards usually mean results of games (1 for a win, 0
for a draw and −1 for a loss). In domain of Atari games, rewards are obtained either
during or at the end of the game. Rest of Equation (1) forms the exploration part.
P(st , a|θ p ) represents predicted probability of action a by the prediction function, c1
and c2 are exploration constants.
Phase of expansion—After selection of unexplored combination of state st and at , new
node (with state st+1 ) is added to the tree structure. State st+1 is obtained by using
dynamic function with selected combination st and at as an input.
Phase of simulation—during the phase of simulation, DNN is called again, specifically
prediction function to obtain probability distribution (used in PUCT equation) and
state value (used to compute q values). These variables are assigned to new node.
Phase of backpropagation—q value computed from state value is back propagated
through trajectory composed of each traversed node during the phase of selection.
Each traversed node’s number of visits N (st , at ) is increased by one.

Unlike the original MCTS, MuZero creates new tree of specific size in each step of the
game to avoid a cumulative error of predicted states. The size of the tree depends on the
number of simulations CS (e.g., 800 simulations per state in board games or 50 simulations
in the domain of Atari games [2]).
Each MCTS node stores following values:
•
•
•
•
•
•

State s
Predicted probability distribution of actions P(s, ·|θ p )
Vector N (s, ·) representing the number of visits of each action
Vector Q(s, ·) of q values for each action
Vector R(s, ·) of rewards for each action
Set of children nodes

In the theory, most of RL papers explain MCTS as a single tree. However, in practice it
is appropriate to play many games in multiple processes in order to collect data as soon
as possible. As we mentioned before, in case of MuZero, new tree is build in each step of
game. Therefore, multiple trees are build at the same time in many processes separately.
Also each process uses DNN with the same weights.
2.2. Parallel Approaches to MCTS
In the last two decades, different approaches have been proposed to obtain parallel
implementation of MCTS phases. Parallelization via CPU is useful, if high performance
shared-memory machines are available [28]. According to [29], we can divide the basic
methods into leaf parallelization, root parallelization and tree parallelization. Leaf parallelization methods are easiest to implement. Each time a node is expanded, multiple parallel
simulations (playouts) are performed. After all playouts are completed, the combined score
is propagated to improve the accuracy of the node value. In root parallelization, multiple
search trees are constructed by separate threads and combined together occasionally. The
most frequently used methods to combine the values from different trees are average voting
and majority voting [30]. These methods tend to have the least communication overhead.
Tree parallelization uses multiple threads to update a single search tree at different nodes.
Since multiple threads can update the same node, data corruption can occur.
Steinmetz and Gini [30] compared the benefits of root parallelization to tree parallelization and measured both against a baseline of building a larger tree utilizing more time. They
obtained the results in the Go domain on CPU hardware and show that parallel algorithms
keep pace with or may exceed the performance gained by increasing the amount of time.
Soejima et al. [31] analyzed the performance of two root parallelization strategies: average
voting and majority voting. Their results with 64 CPU cores and computer Go programs
showed that majority voting outperforms average voting. Rocki and Suda [17] proposed
a hybrid CPU-GPU parallel MCTS based on the Block-parallel scheme. The method runs
several trees in root parallel fashion on the CPU and blocks of leaf parallel playouts on the
GPU. In this approach, the GPU kernel is called asynchronously and the control is given
back to CPU. Barriga et al. [32] proposed Multiblock Parallel algorithm. The method is
similar to the [17], but instead of running simulations only for one child of the selected
node, they run simulations for all children. The goal is to take full utilization of GPU.
Świechowski and Mańdziuk [33] investigate the concept of parallelization of MCTS on
general game playing framework. They proposed Limited Hybrid Root-Tree Parallelization
method. The idea is to combine root and tree parallelization approaches. They use tree parallelization within one CPU machine which is then mixed by root parallelization between

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

the machines. Liu et al. [34] proposed parallelization of MCTS with UCT modification Balance Unobserved in UCT (BU-UCT). BU-UCT is designed to efficiently divide nodes
during the selection phase into multiple process workers. These workers are responsible
for implementing the next three phases.
The mentioned approaches focus on parallelization of operations in one huge MCTS
tree. However, our goal is to implement fully GPU parallelization which focuses on
processing a large number of relatively small MCTS trees instead of single large one.
The proposed implementation deals directly with parallelization of multiple MCTS trees
in conditions with one or small number of GPUs. Implementations that address the
parallelization of multiple MCTS trees are based on fully CPU or semi-GPU parallelization.
The closest to our work are Werner [35] and EfficientZero [36] implementations.
Werner’s open-source implementation of MuZero uses multiprocessing during data
collection. In each process, the copy of DNN is held. Only one game runs per process, so
the parallelization of MCTS is designed as one MCTS per process. The implementation
uses Ray library utilizing a single GPU per process. Therefore, in computers with a lower
number of GPUs it is better to use fully CPU implementation. Werner’s implementation
has been widely used [26,27,37,38] and there are many other implementations based on the
same principle available on GitHub [39–44].
EfficientZero is more sample efficient version of original MuZero. In their implementation, each process also holds current copy of the DNN on GPU. Each process collects data
from multiple games. MCTS method is applied to all observations simultaneously, so that
multiple trees are built in method (one tree per game). During MCTS simulation, phase of
selection is executed sequentially for each tree. Selected states and actions are sent as batch
into DNN. New nodes are sequentially created based on the obtained data (new states
with probability distributions and state values). During backpropagation phase, nodes of
traversed trajectories are also updated sequentially.
3. Proposed Implementation
In the case of Werner implementation, the inefficient parts are computation of prediction for each tree separately and higher communication overhead (e.g., sending collected
data to the main process, and updating the DNNs in child processes). In the case of the
EfficientZero, the disadvantage is the sequential processing of most MCTS phases in each
processed tree.
Our implementation is based on tensor operations because they can be automatically
parallelized on the GPU. Therefore, in each phase all trees are processed in parallel. We
used Python library for deep learning—PyTorch [45]. However, the proposed method can
be easilly implemented in other libraries such as TensorFlow [46].
3.1. Data Structure and Notation
In this section we introduce data structure and the established notations. Our data
structure consists of the multiple tensors to store different attributes of MCTS nodes.
During the design, we were inspired by the structure of the Q table. Q table is a matrix
holding q values. Rows represent states and columns possible actions in environment.
Although Q table stores all possible states, we need to store significantly smaller number of
states. MCTS method is applied on batch which consists of CT observations (i.e., running
environments) with CS MCTS simulations per observation. Therefore, we need to store
CT + CS × CT states. First CT states are roots obtained from observations via representation
function. Next CS × CT states will be explored and stored during the MCTS simulations
(CT states per simulation). In our implementation we have to leave the zero row empty
for implementation reasons (explained later), so the total number of rows in each tensor is
CR = CT + CS × CT + 1.
Data structure of proposed method (shown in Figure 1) consists of following tensors:
•

Tensor S—all states are held in tensor S. The number of dimensions of tensor S is
equal to the number of dimensions of the state +1. The index of the first dimension

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

6 of 20

represents unique IDs that are shared across all tensors. States are added into tensor S
during the initialization (roots) and simulations (explored states) in order that they
were visited (roots have indices from 1 to CT , explored states from the first simulation
have indices between CT + 1 and 2 × CT and so on).
Tensor Q—q values are stored in tensor Q, similar to the Q table. First index (of the
row) is the same unique ID of the node as we mentioned in tensor S. The size of tensor
is CR × | A|. At the beginning of MCTS method, all values in tensor Q are initialized to
zeros. During the phase of backpropagation, q values of traversed nodes are updated.
Tensor R—holds the predicted rewards by dynamics function. It works on the same
principle as tensor Q and has the same size CR × | A|. Rewards are put into tensor
during phase of expansion.
Tensor P—stores the predicted probabilities computed by prediction function. The
size is similar like previous two tensors CR × | A|.
Tensor N—unlike the previous tensors composed by real numbers, tensor N consists
of integers. It stores the numbers of visits of nodes (executed combinations of states
and actions). The size of tensor is again CR × | A|.
Tensor E—the last tensor E (with the size CR × | A|) holds IDs of children nodes. For
example, if there is an edge from the parent node ID = i after taking action a to the
children node ID = j, then E(i, a) = j. If there is no edge between two nodes, the
value in tensor is zero. For that reason, zeroth row is empty in each tensor.

Figure 1. Data structure—the data of each node is stored in 6 tensors. IDs represent indices of nodes
(they are not stored as tensor values). For example, the highlighted rows represent all stored data of a
node with ID = 1.

The complete data structure consists of the above mentioned 6 tensors. The first index
of each tensor is the ID of the node (index of the row). In the tensor S, index i returns i-th
state (of the node with ID = i) whereas in other tensors i-th vector is returned instead. E.g.,
in tensor Q, the index i returns vector of q values Q(i ) = [ Q(i, 0), Q(i, 1), · · · , Q(i, | A| − 1)].
On the other hand, index i in combination with action index a returns scalar q value Q(i, a).
In our implementation, we often index via vectors (as a part of tensor operations). E.g.,
combination of node index i and vector of actions ~a = [ a0 , a15 , a17 ], where a0 , a15 and a17 represent integer numbers, applied to tensor Q results in Q(i,~a) = [ Q(i, a0 ), Q(i, a15 ), Q(i, a17 )].

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

Indexing by combination of two vectors ~i = [i2 , i5 , i1 , i25 ] and ~a = [ a10 , a5 , a17 , a10 ] applied
to tensor Q lead to Q(~i,~a) = [ Q(i2 , a10 ), Q(i5 , a5 ), Q(i1 , a17 ), Q(i25 , a10 )].
3.2. Initialization and Preprocessing
At the beginning of the method, local variables are initialized (Algorithm 1, lines
1–9) based on the obtained parameters o, CS , and | A|. Vector of unique root indices
~i R = [1, 2, 3, · · · , CT − 1, CT ] is generated. These indices are utilized as unique identifiers
across all tensors.
The tensor of root states s is computed from the obtained batch of observations by
representation function. The tensor of probabilities and vector of values are predicted by
the prediction function. Dirichlet noise is added to the tensor of probabilities in order to
support the exploration of MuZero. States and tensors of probabilities are inserted into
tensors S and P via a vector of root indices (Algorithm 1, lines 14–15).

3.3. Phase of Selection
The pseudocode of the phase of selection is given in Algorithm 2, and the flowchart is
shown in Figure 2. During one iteration of MCTS, each tree is traversed to find the leaf node.
Let the L-step trajectory consists of combinations of traversed nodes and edges (actions) inorder, then we can write trajectory as τ = [( ID0 , a0 ), ( ID1 , a1 ), ( ID2 , a2 ), · · · , ( IDL−1 , a L−1 )].
Tensor I holds IDs of traversed nodes and tensor A indices of selected actions chosen by
the PUCT method. Both tensors have size CN × CT . CN is the number of simulations
increased by one because the first ID and action in trajectory belong to the root of a tree.
Each tree has its trajectory stored in one column whose index corresponds to a particular
tree. Therefore, the number of columns is CT . Vector ~l stores the indices of the last elements
of each trajectory. Information stored in all three tensors are used in the next phases.
Each trajectory starts from the root. Root indices (IDs) are inserted into the zero row of
tensor I (Algorithm 2, line 4).
Indices of active trajectories are stored in vector i~N . In other words, vector i~N remembers indices of trees that are still active in the phase of selection. At the beginning of each
selection phase, vector is filled by vector of all tree indices because each tree takes a part in
the selection phase.
The loop of the selection phase starts with condition i~N 6= ∅. Condition checks
whether the vector of active trajectories is empty. If there is no active trajectory, the phase of
selection is finished. Otherwise, IDs of nodes in active trajectories are assigned to vector~i by

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

8 of 20

indexing via the current step and vector i~N in the tensor I (Algorithm 2, line 8). Computing
of the PUCT method (Equation (1)) for current nodes is fully executed by tensor operations
of adding, multiplying, dividing, etc. The method returns vector of selected actions of
current nodes.
Indices of the last items in active trajectories are updated (Algorithm 2, line 11).
The IDs of the nodes accessed using the actions ~a in current nodes ~i are obtained from
tensor E. As we mentioned before, if there is no children node for combination (( ID, a)), 0
is returned instead. Obtained IDs and possible zero indices are inserted into a new row of
the tensor I.
For simplicity’s sake, let the number of trees CT = 4, number of active trajectories
|i~N | = 3, indices of active trajectories i~N = [0, 1, 3], node IDs ~i = [5, 7, 8], selected actions
~a = [3, 1, 0] and IDs of children nodes E(~i,~a) = [ E(5, 3) = 15, E(7, 1) = 0, E(8, 0) = 21] =
[15, 0, 21]. Since I (step, i~N ) = [15, 0, 21], updated row of the tensor is I (step) = [15, 0, 0, 21].
I (step, 0) = 15 and I (step, 3) = 21 indicate active trajectories. I (step, 1) = 0 represents
inactive trajectory. This trajectory has been terminated in the current step because the node
with ID = 7 has no children, e.g., E(7, 1) = 0. I (step, 2) = 0 represents a trajectory that
was already inactive.
Finally, we update the indices of nonzero values from the current row of I. If there is
no nonzero value, the phase of selection is completed. On the other hand, if there is at least
one nonzero value (active trajectory), the next phase of the MCTS simulation begins.

3.4. Phase of Expansion and Simulation
We joined phases of expansion and simulation (Algorithm 3 and Figure 3) because
both phases are interconnected and it is effective to implement them together. Based on
the vector of last indices ~l, combinations of last nodes and actions are identified for all
trajectories (Algorithm 3, lines 1–3). Tensor of new states s and vector of obtained rewards
~r are computed by dynamics function. The new states are then used in the prediction
function to predict tensor of probabilities p and vector of values ~v.
IDs of new nodes are computed from the vector of roots i~R . Tensors of children nodes
E and rewards R are updated by new data.
At the end of the expansion phase, predicted tensors of states s and probability
distributions p are added to the tensors S and P as data of new nodes (Algorithm 3, lines
9–10).

3.5. Phase of Backpropagation
During the phase of backpropagation (Algorithm 4 and Figure 4), trajectories are
traversed from the end to the start to update q values and numbers of visits. At the
beginning of the backpropagation phase, the local variable step stores the length of the
longest trajectory obtained in the selection phase. Therefore, the loop of backpropagation
starts from step − 1.

We first select the trajectory indices that were active in the selection phase during the
actual step. Based on the obtained indices, IDs and actions in actual step are identified from
tensors I and A (Algorithm 4, lines 3–4).
Values of active trajectories ~v(i~N ) are used to update q values of parent nodes (values
of non-active trajectories remain unchanged). In the end, tensors Q and N are updated by
standard formulas (Equation (4) of [2]).
The loop of backpropagation ends by updating q values and the number of visits of
root nodes.

3.6. Post Processing
The MCTS method completes after CS simulations have been executed. At the end
of the MCTS method, it is necessary to calculate the probability distribution and the state
N (s ,a)
value of each root state. Probability of root action a is computed as ∑ N (root
. The values
sroot ,b)
b
of the root states are computed as a weighted arithmetic mean of root q values and their
probability distributions. All computations are carried out on GPU exploiting tensor
operations for adding, multiplication and division.
4. Experiments
The proposed implementation aims at the evaluation of a large number of MCTS
instances in parallel. We demonstrate this capability with an example from the RL domain
where a large number of observations need to be processed at the same time. Each observation represents the state in the environment (root state in MCTS tree) in which we want to
perform an action. MCTS algorithm is utilized in RL to improve action selection process.
We compared proposed implementation to three MCTS implementations used in
model-based RL methods. We measured the performance of individual implementations in
terms of how long it takes to simultaneously evaluate MCTS on batch of observations. For
each experiment, we report the mean and standard deviation calculated from 100 replications. All experiments were carried out on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics
card and 16-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2643 @ 3.30GHz processor.
The list of compared implementations together with their designation is as follows:
•
•

•

•

GPU—The proposed method fully implemented on GPU using tensor operations and
described in Section 3.
CPUGPU_P—Implementation inspired by EfficientZero [36] which uses multiple processes. Each process builds multiple trees and stores copy of DNN on GPU. However,
maintaining a copy of DNN by children processes is memory inefficient which limits
their use especially in single GPU scenarios. Therefore, in our modification, only the
parent process stores a DNN on GPU.
At the beginning of MCTS method, batch of observations is given to representation
and prediction functions (on GPU) to predict states, probability distributions and
state values in roots. Predicted data are split and sent to the children processes in
which trees are initialized (one tree per root’s state). MCTS simulations are executed
in each process. Phase of selection is executed sequentially on CPU. States of selected
nodes and actions are sent back into parent process. After receiving data from all
children processes, new states, rewards, probabilities and values are predicted by one
forward of dynamics and prediction functions (on GPU). Predicted data are split and
sent again into children processes in which phases of expansion and backpropagation
are performed (also on CPU). After executing MCTS simulations, the parent process
receives and post-processes the results.
CPUGPU_S—A sequential implementation of CPUGPU_P method without multiprocessing. Phases of selection, expansion and backpropagation are performed on
CPU inorder. As in the previous implementation, all data is processed as a batch by
DNN on GPU. Both CPUGPU_P and CPUGPU_S were implemented by our team and
used as a part of AlphaZero in [47].
CPU—Last approach represents Werner’s MCTS implementation. We used the source
code from author’s GitHub repository [35].

4.1. Model of Environment
We chose MuZero algorithm as an example of model-based RL method that utilize
MCTS. Our experimental setup was inspired by the domain of Atari games. One observation (state of the environment) was represented by 128 × 96 × 96 tensor. The number of
possible actions was set to 18, which is the maximum amount of possible actions in domain

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

13 of 20

of Atari games. MuZero algorithm uses DNN to approximate representation, dynamics and
prediction function. We use original MuZero’s architecture [2] with a few modifications.
The kernel size is 3 × 3 for all operations. The convolution operations padding is set
to 1. Representation function is identical copy of MuZero’s original function. It consists of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

1 convolution with stride 2 and 128 kernels, output resolution 48 × 48
2 residual blocks with 128 kernels
1 convolution with stride 2 and 256 kernels, output resolution 24 × 24
3 residual blocks with 256 kernels
average pooling with stride 2, output resolution 12 × 12
3 residual blocks with 256 kernels
average pooling with stride 2, output resolution 6 × 6

Output size of representation function, i.e., state size is 256 × 6 × 6.
The input to the dynamics function is 257 × 6 × 6 dimensional tensor consisted of state
and action. Action represents tensor 1 × 6 × 6 filled by value count oaft actions . The dynamics
function provides two outputs. The first is the new state and the second is the reward.
The reward in original MuZero implementation was computed as a linear combination of
categorical output. We formulated reward prediction problem as a regression task instead.
The second change from the original implementation is in the structure of hidden layers of
reward head as they were not described in the documentation.
Layers of dynamics functions are:
•
•
•
•
•

1 convolution with 256 kernels, output resolution 6 × 6
8 residual blocks with 256 kernels, output resolution 6 × 6 (the last residual block is
also used as a representation of the new state)
flattening, number of output neurons is 9216
fully connected layer with 512 neurons
fully connected layer with 1 neuron (reward output)

Outputs of representation and dynamics functions are used as inputs for prediction
function. It also provides two outputs—probability distribution and state value. The
common part is composed of flattening and linear layer with 512 neurons. Each output head
consists of one linear layer with 512 neurons. Last linear layer of probability distribution
has 18 neurons. As in the case of the reward head, last output layer of the state value head
has one neuron. Again, the categorical task has been reformulated into a regression task.
Our goal was not to train MuZero agent but to compare the computational speed of
individual MCTS implementations. Therefore, we used a randomly initialized DNN model
to simulate all necessary computations.
4.2. MCTS Parameters
Batch of observations is generated as a random tensor of size CT . Each of these
observations is processed by a unique instance of MCTS with the number of simulations
set to CS .
Although MCTS uses PUCT formula to select action, we modified the action selection
mechanism to test the edge cases of tree formation based on the following scenarios:
1.

2.

Random action—in this scenario, the action is selected randomly. This scenario causes
the tree to build in breadth (tree resembles a balanced tree). The scenario reflects, for
example, the behavior at the beginning of RL agent training, when the DNN produces
approximately uniform probability distribution of actions.
Constant action—in this scenario, the selected action is replaced by a constant action.
This scenario causes the tree to build in depth (tree resembles a linked list). The
scenario reflects, for example, the behavior of the trained or overfitted agent, when
the DNN produces one dominant action.

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

14 of 20

The use of scenarios is implemented by changing the value of probability distribution
function according to the given scenario and setting the scalar values (e.g., state value and
reward) to zero.
4.3. Results
We report results for two sets of experiments. In the first set, we measured the
performance of MCTS adjusted for the effect of DNN model used by MuZero. Architecture
of DNN utilized by MuZero is strongly dependent on the application. Therefore we first
provide performance of compared implementations without the DNN model. Second set of
experiments shows results on the use case of MuZero with DNN model described earlier.
Results for experiments without DNN model are shown in Tables 1 and 2. We fixed
the number of simulation CS to 50. Batch of observations size CT was set to 50, 100, 250,
500 and 750. In the case of CPUGPU_P implementation, we report results for number of
processes set to 2, 5, 10 and 25. For CPU implementation, we report results with number
of processes set to 5, 10 and 15. In both cases, a larger and smaller number of processes
resulted in higher computation time.

In both random action and constant action scenarios we see a similar pattern. Proposed GPU implementations is the fastest for all tested values of the CT parameter. The
difference in speed increases with increasing number of observations. In Figure 5 we show

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

detail comparison between two best performing implementations for both scenarios. For
CT = 750, proposed GPU implementations is 34.8 times faster for random action scenario
and 16 times faster for constant action scenario than the second best performing CPUGPU_P
implementations (with 10 and 25 processes respectively). In the constant action scenario
(Table 2), the computational time increased for most of the investigated implementations
and their settings. This increase is due to a growing trajectories obtained by the phase of
selection in MCTS.

We further investigated influence of the number of MCTS simulations CS and report
results for two best performing implementations in Tables 3, 4 and Figure 6. The CT
parameter was set to 100. We can observe that the computation time increases significantly
as the number of simulations increases, especially in constant action scenario. Proposed
GPU implementation is 12.1 times faster for CS = 50 and 8.7 times faster for CS = 400 in
random action scenario. In constant action scenario, GPU implementation is 4.2 times faster
for CS = 50 and 2 times faster for CS = 400.

Last experiments measured performance with DNN model. We omitted CPU method
from results due to the high computation requirements associated with the execution of
DNN model (e.g., 338 s for CS = 50, and CT = 50). Similarly to previous experiments, we
fixed CS to 50 and set CT to 50, 100, 250, 500 and 750. Results presented in Tables 5, 6 and
Figure 7 show similar trend as in experiments without DNN. Proposed GPU is the best
performing implementation for all values of parameter CT . Even with the DNN model,
which consumes most of the computation, GPU implementation is 4.7 times faster for
random action scenario and 7.7 times faster for constant action scenario than the second
best performing CPUGPU_P implementations (with 10 and 25 processes respectively), for
CT = 750.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a parallel implementation of MCTS that efficiently evaluates
large number of MCTS trees at once. It utilizes tensor operations and is fully implemented
on GPU. We show that the atomic nature of MCTS operations can be transformed into
vector operations suitable for GPU. We demonstrated this capability using the example
of MuZero model-based RL agent in Atari game domain. Model-based RL agents often
combine DNN and MCTS approaches to improve action selection. During the offline
training, these RL agents requires to process a huge amount of observations in parallel.
These observations are represented by unique root nodes in MCTS.
We compared our implementation with approaches based on the Werner and EfficientZero implementations. We show that the proposed approach gives the best results
and scales well with the number of observations and number of simulations. We tested
two scenarios of tree formations: random action and constant action. For both scenarios
the proposed implementations yield the best results. In experiments without DNN, the
proposed implementation is 34.8 times faster for the random action and 16 times faster for
the constant action scenario than the second best performing CPUGPU_P implementation
(CT = 750 and CS = 50).
We further investigated the effect of DNN in RL agent. In experiments with DNN and
for the random action, the proposed implementation is 4.7 times faster than the second best
performing CPUGPU_P for the value of parameters CT = 750 and CS = 50. In the case

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 1406

18 of 20

of the constant action, this difference is 7.7 fold. Therefore, we observed a performance
improvement over the benchmark implementations in both non-DNN and DNN settings.
Although we report results when MCTS is utilized within the MuZero RL agent,
the proposed implementation can be used wherever a large number of MCTS instances
need to be processed in parallel. The closest example to us is the use in the model-based
RL. We show an example of model-based MuZero agent which uses DNN to learn model
dynamics. The proposed implementation can also be utilized in model-based RL agent with
an explicitly given model of environment. In this case the overall performance depends on
the complexity of environment and its implementation.
Our implementation was tested using a single GPU. We see no restrictions for deployment on a larger number of GPUs. However, for more complex computing infrastructures,
we expect that directly tailored methods will yield better results, as they can exploit the
specifics of a given infrastructure.

Humans or Machines? Scientific Determinism within the
Context of Yoruba Human Ontology

Abstract
Freewill has been a subject of intense study in the history of philosophy, this revolves around the
debate that are humans free or are their actions determined? While there has been a lot of
questions on the nature of human will, the search for answers remains relevant in contemporary
studies as seen in the entrance of neuroscience to this quest. Neuroscience, in the study of the
human will arrived at a conclusion based on empirical studies that freewill is an illusion because
the human will is determined by cerebral activities. The discovery in the field of neuroscience
therefore challenges the traditional belief about freewill and our beliefs that humans are in full
control of their will. This submission indicated that human decisions for actions were initiated
before humans became aware of them, that is, likening humans to machines, thereby creating a
lacuna especially within the Yoruba religious and cultural contexts. This study therefore,
interrogated the position of neuroscience on the human will by focusing on how scientific
determinism can be viewed from the Yoruba worldview. Scientific determinism evident in the field
of neuroscience was examined with a view to situating the findings of neuroscience on human
will within the context of Yoruba human ontology.
Keywords: Freewill, Neuroscience, Yoruba Human Ontology, Scientific Determinism, Cognition.
Introduction
Advances in scientific studies create room for speculation on the nature of humanity, given the
success of science in different areas of study. The entrance of cognitive neuroscience to the
debate on freewill has renewed interest in the ancient debate and also changed the course of the
debate from what applied in the past which revolves round the various variants of determinism
such as theological, physical, psychological, and cultural determinism, to something new. The
new debate, which is the science driven debate, revolves around the science of the brain and the
submission that human beings do not have what is believed as freewill, with the implication that
humans may be likened to mere machines. There are some instances where positions of scholars
can be seen as mere threats to freewill as well as other cases where there is an outright denial of
freewill premised on the findings in the field of neuroscience. However, like any other subject in
philosophy, the position of neuroscience is not one that is universally shared. Philosophers,
theologians, and even neuroscientists are of different opinions on the subject of freewill, based
on the submission of neuroscience. This study is therefore poised to examine scientific
determinism within the context of human ontology of the Yoruba, Southwest Nigeria.

Methodology
This study adopted a modus of Experimental Philosophy, which is a relatively new methodology
in philosophy as it employs experiments or empirical studies to unravel traditional issues in
philosophy. An example of such traditional issues is the subject of freewill. Neuroscientists held
the view that freewill is an illusion because the human will is determined by cerebral activities,
making it imperative to use the methods of Experimental Philosophy. Experimentation featured
greatly in this study because results of experiments of neuroscientists and psychologists were
used to analyze the extant philosophical ideas on human will. By the use of Experimental
Philosophy here, the subject of freewill was examined, using systematic empirical studies on the
subject by situating it within the context of Yoruba religion and culture. Experimental Philosophy
as used in this study adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the subject matter by viewing it
through the lens of neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, religion and the culture of the Yoruba.
Humans or Machines? Neuroscientific Arguments against Freewill
Do we have freewill or are our actions beyond our control? This is a hoary question that
philosophers and theologians have grappled with for years. Now, neuroscientists have joined the
quest to answer this question, thereby creating another question, are we humans or machines?
Neuroscience, while trying to solve the puzzle surrounding freewill, came to an interesting
conclusion which threatens the established notion that humans are free. A major reason why
neuroscience serves as a threat to this established notion is because the position of neuroscience
is believed to be based on empirical evidence derived from various factual experiments. It is
interesting to note that even neuroscientists themselves are of different opinions on the subject
of freewill. Some are reluctant to admit that freewill does not exist, while some others make a
subtle denial of the notion of freewill and still, others admit outrightly that freewill does not exist.
A notable advocate of the latter notion is Sam Harris, who makes a very direct attack on the
subject of freewill. In his book, Against Freewill, he makes a lot of cases in his denial of freewill.
According to him, “freewill is an illusion; our wills are simply not of our own making. Thoughts and
intentions emerge from background causes of which we are not aware and over which we have
no conscious control. We do not have the freedom we think we have”1. He asks also that: “how
can we make sense of our lives, and hold people accountable for their choices, given the
unconscious origin of our conscious mind?”2 These are serious questions because of the
importance of accountability, which is necessary in any sane, normal human environment. Daniel
Wegner also shares the position of Harris that freewill is an illusion: there is a very conspicuous
and catchy statement which comprises the first words of Wegner’s book “it usually seems that we
consciously will our actions, but this is an illusion”.3 Wegner believes that calling an illusion might
be too strong but he posits that most prior understandings of human will may not fit into current
scientific realities.
The argument of the neuroscientist is that the whole idea of freewill can be reduced to causal,
bodily processes. This is not a new idea, but a-two-and–a-half century-old supposition. It was
l’homme machine (man a machine), a philosophical manifesto by Julien Offray de La Metrie, that
solved the problem of Cartesian dualism. La Metrie’s manifesto was decisive for the future of
modern science, ‘science of the human’. This is relevant today for Verplaetse made efforts to
prove that there is no freewill, and that everything a human being does can be traced back to

strict causality.4 This causality is the crux of the argument against freewill, and these causal bodily
processes originate outside of consciousness. This is the basis of the argument of the scholars
that oppose freewill. If a person is unconscious of the processes and the origin of his/her intentions
or actions, then how can such acts be regarded as free?
Bruce Hood also seems to be an advocate of the position of neuroscience which seems to suggest
that freewill is an illusion. However, Hood presents a different meaning of the term illusion.
According to him, although our daily experiences are so familiar, yet the brain science shows that
this is an illusion. The term illusion as seen by Hood does not mean that it does not exist, but
rather that ‘it is not what it seems:’ Hood agrees that understanding that the self or our will is not
true is really quite difficult to admit, subsequently it may be one of the most difficult to accept since
our will or self seems so convincing or real. But then, again, many aspects of our experiences are
not what they seem.5 The point of the argument here is that history reveals to us that a number
of cultural and religious beliefs have been disproved by modern findings and such beliefs are no
longer valid, such as the shape of the earth, the erroneous belief of the sun circling the earth, the
age of the earth and other similar notions. If these notions are debunked as a result of research
and modern findings, what is the guarantee that the hitherto held notion that humans have freewill
could also not be disproved as neuroscience seems to suggest?
On another similar note, Heidi Ravven argues that it is not obvious that human beings have
freewill as we like to believe, in the way that we have hands and feet, instead freewill is a cultural
assumption, and it is an assumption that turns out to be false. Ravven argues further that freewill
is a cultural assumption which has its root in Western culture. He believes that the culture that
support freewill is hinged on the assumed moral nature of humans --- that ‘everyone’ knows we
have freewill. This notion, Ravven argues, is false.6 He believes that the belief in freewill is a
western cultural idea which he believes has its roots also in Christianity that is not universally
shared. Ravven believes also that the notion of freewill is based on a theological story whose
religious origin and meaning people are often unaware of and which some even reject explicitly.
He traces the belief in freewill to early Latin Christianity which was widely disseminated through
authoritative thinkers who outlawed contrary views and later became engrained in our laws,
institutions and practices and passed down from one generation to another.7 Similarly, Nicholas
Vale also uses historical evidence to argue against freewill. He believes that although evidences
demonstrating that we do not have freewill are accumulating in the sciences like neuroscience
and psychology, in philosophy, however, history shows arguments against freewill. The logical
arguments against freewill have been understood since the times of the Greeks.8 Verplaetse also
made reference to neuroscience as well as the whole argument against freewill long before the
advent of neuroscience.
Harris posits categorically that, a person’s intention to act in a way or to do a particular thing or
action and not something else does not begin in his /her consciousness, but he posts that, it
appears in unconsciousness. Harris made use of the findings of Benjamin Libet and findings from
more recent research to argue against freewill. “Direct recordings from the cortex showed that the

activity of merely 256 neurons were sufficient to predict with 80% accuracy a person’s decision to
move 700 milliseconds before he became aware of it… these findings are difficult to reconcile
with the sense that we are conscious authors of our actions”.9 Similarly, whether by accident,
disease or debauchery, studies in brain science shows that if the brain is damaged, the person is
different. Also, taking certain drugs can alter the functioning of the brain and the behavior of a
person. So, who ‘we are’ depends on our brains even though we are not just our brains in isolation.
Another argument that tilts in favour of the position of neuroscience as it threatens freewill is from
the perspective of the relevance of the debate for moral responsibility within the context of criminal
law. The point here is that since the existence of freewill is questioned, and retributive punishment
on the other hand requires freedom of the will, there is a need then to revise our justification for
punishment or eliminate punishment altogether. The kind of responsibility suggested here is
known as desert-based morality, and it may not be pragmatic because blame is its corollary and
the application of sanction my not be practical because emphasis is on the person and not the
action.10In Living without Free will, Derek Pereboom argues that imagining a life without the idea
of freewill and morality would not be as destructive as many people believe.11 This idea of a need
to re-think our ideas of morality and responsibility is quite relevant in Nigeria in cases where the
punitive measures are directly proportional or related to the persons and not to the actions. The
‘small’ thief, who steals a mobile phone or a goat for example is most times usually punished
whereas the ‘big’ thief such as politicians or government officials who steal huge sums of money,
most times, gets away. The major point of this argument is that the findings of neuroscience
suggest a need to revise the existing punitive practices and examine the justification for
punishments. However, the call for the elimination of punishment altogether is another issue
entirely because of the practicality of this suggestion in any human society especially as it relates
to human values.
Sam Harris, as vocal as he is on the subject of the absence of human freewill, makes some valid
salient assertions on human will as it concerns human values. He claims that the more knowledge
and understanding we have on the workings of the human brain, the better positioned we are in
providing right or wrong answers to questions related to human values. Harris in his phenomenal
book ‘The Moral Landscape: How Science can determine Human Values’ has a unique goal of
beginning a discourse on how morality may be truly understood in scientific terms which is within
another context, outside of ethics or philosophy.12 This means that in reality, what we do is often
as a result of other factors around us and the state of our mind, not really “the will”. For example,
a clergyman in a cassock will most likely not fight with a bus conductor no matter the level of
aggravation. This is not because he cannot exchange blows with him, but because certain factors
will determine his actions not to fight. His behavior is most likely dependent on the cassock he is
wearing, the societal or religious expectations from him (as a priest, that he is conscious of), and
the state of his mind at that particular time.
Bruce Waller also makes a strong case which may make allow one to wonder if humans are not
becoming machines by suggesting a world void of moral responsibility. In his book, Against Moral
Responsibility, he cites many examples in which practices of moral responsibility are counterproductive from a humanitarian or practical standpoint.13 The position of Waller is valid and
practical to a large extent because it is true that oftentimes, ‘morality’, draws us away from the

hidden factors responsible for people’s actions. We usually place a lot of emphasis on the ‘actions’
at the expense of the factors that have influenced the acts. When a person is involved in an act,
morality makes us quick to judge the act leaving little or no room for the various factors such as
genetics, up-bringing, social status, education, religion, race and other salient and important
factors.
Sam Harris, in another work titled Free Will, makes some valid assertions similar to those of
Waller. He says:
Without freewill, sinners and criminals would be nothing more than poorly
calibrated clock-work and any conception of justice that emphasized
punishing them (rather than deterring, rehabilitating or merely curtailing
them) would appear incongruous.14

Harris goes further to relate a very graphic tale of a heinous crime in which two career criminals
Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjersky in July 23, 2007, killed a family in a most brutal way.
Harris makes some important points, that whether criminals like these two men mentioned above
can be judged for the factors that led to their acting the way they did and not mere because of
what they did. According to Harris:
As sickening as I find their behavior, I have to admit that if I were to trade
places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would be him. If I had been
in the shoes of one of these criminals and had his genes and life
experiences and an identical brain or soul in an identical state—I (Harris)
would have acted exactly as he did.15(Harris, 2015:4-5)

Smit asks also, in corroboration with the position of Harris; Did you choose your genetic
composition? Did you choose your looks, talents or weaknesses, your baritone or sonorous voice,
or your peculiar character traits? A substantive part of these factors was determined genetically.16
Similarly, Igor Alexander asks some interesting questions: what is it in our brain that determines
our decisions? How free is my desire or my volition? What are the factors that determine which
choice I will make? Is what I actually do pre-determined in some way? What we naturally think
about freewill is a product of the culture in which we live. Freewill is an integrated part of our
consciousness, and it is therefore a matter for brain science and through axioms, a matter for
which we might try to identify mechanisms that can be said to possess it. Aleksander claims also
that it was the famous discovery of Benjamin Libet that led Harvard psychologist Dan Wegner to
argue that determining what we want is not based on conscious brain activity at all, but on some
unconscious occurrence which both determines what we want and how we get it. Wegner argues
that what we feel about having caused things to happen by willing it is false for conscious will is
an illusion.17
This means, most times thoughts flick through our minds. Often times we do not originate these
thoughts, they just come “on their own” and most times, we act on these thoughts impulsively. It
must be noted that although we cannot originate certain thoughts on our own, we also have the
power, sometimes to make them go away or retain them, or to act or not to act on them.

Astonishing though the hypothesis may be, according to Stephen Pinker “the evidence is now
overwhelming that it is true. Many cause-and-effect linkages have a physical event on one side
and a mental event on the other.”18 Pinker narrates the possibility of altering who a person is when
certain electrical, chemical or biological changes occur in the brain. Such a person behaves
differently as a result of the change that has taken place. Thus, the minutest details of brain
activities are now accessible through the new technologies, “such as: functional magnetic
resonance imaging, magneto encephalography, positron emission tomography and
electroencephalography”. 19 Tiny details of different activities such as thought, perception emotion
and other activities produce different signals which can be read as a result of the new
technologies.20
To explain this fact, Pinker gives an astonishing example of the brain under surgery:
When a surgeon takes a surgical knife and cuts the corpus callosum, (a
part of the brain which joins the two cerebral hemispheres), the mind is
split in two and in some sense the body is inhabited by two selves. Under
the microscope, the tissues of the brain show a breath-taking degree of
complexity—perhaps a hundred trillion synapses—that is fully
commensurate with the breath-taking complexity of human thought and
experience.21 (Pinker,1999:np)

This fact shows that the brain is not just an ordinary organ in the body; it has a lot of dominance
on what is understood as the “self’. Another example that supports this fact is the issue of insanity,
a person that is sick in the brain loses his/her grasp on his/her personality, he/she becomes a
different person and would be seen doing what he/she might not have done in a normal state.
In spite of the various positions of scholars that argue directly or indirectly against freewill on the
basis of the position of neuroscience, it is imperative to discuss the famous 1983 work of Benjamin
Libet. This is necessary because Libet is responsible for this revolutionary thinking on the subject
of freewill. However, it is worthy of note that Libet also might have been influenced by the works
of others because he made references to the works of Deecke, Grozinger & Kornhuber (1976),
Vaughn & Coster (1966) and Kornhuber & Deecke (1965). He quoted all these works while trying
to explain the origin of ‘RP’ (readiness potential) and the bases of further research in this area.
However, he ended up becoming popular with the whole idea of employing neuroscience to solve
the problems of freewill. Libet believes that the discovery of ‘RP’ opened up the new possibilities
for analysing freewill through experiments which is what experimental philosophy is all about.
In the legendary article of Libet which contributed immensely to the revolution in the subject of
freewill, he presents a number of findings which served as the bases of subsequent studies and
the premise of the arguments of several scholars including some of the ones discussed earlier.
These later studies were probably carried out to debunk his findings or corroborate his positions;
it however turned out that these studies became the bases of the acceptance of his views and
they made his work very popular. In this famous article of Libet, his argument is quite straight18

forward, if humans are conscious of their intentions to act in a particular way, then, the experience
of initiation of such activities should begin before or should start at the same time brain (cerebral)
activities related to such activities begin. This process has been faulted by various experiments
which show that what is understood as volitional acts occur after electro physiological processes
called readiness potential- RPs.22
The meaning of this argument of Libet is this; if a conscious intent or decision to act initiates
voluntary acts, then personal experience of initiating this act must occur before brain activities or
at least occur at the same time. Another interpretation is this; our understanding of factors related
to freewill is that it is the person, the mind or the soul or whatsoever we understand as the ‘real
self’ that should pass ‘orders’ of will, intention or decision to do a particular thing to the brain,
which would then send the message to the related part of the body, for example the leg, which
would perform the action; say move to a place. However, these brain experiments have disrupted
this flow of events, the brain is now the first point of action, the argument of Libet is that for our
understanding of freewill to be valid, the brain activities for an action should not begin before the
‘real self’ is conscious of that act or least both brain activities and personal consciousness should
coincide, but not the former before the later.
As daunting as this barrage of evidence from neuroscience suggesting that human actions are
not really free which reduces humanity to the level of machines, there are obvious implications
for accepting their conclusions in the real world outside of the laboratories of the neuroscientist,
psychologists or the world of the philosophers. In a society like that of the Yoruba, this scientific
understanding of human will can only make sense by understanding the ontology of the word
human, which begins with an understanding of the race.
Background Study of the Yoruba
The origin of the Yorùbá is mostly traced to Oduduwa, who is believed to be the progenitor of the
people. The Yorùbá people predominate in south western Nigeria and are one of the major ethnic
groups in the country.23 Nigeria is situated in the West African sub-region and it is the most
populous black nation on earth with an estimated population of over 140 million people. 24 The
Yorùbá people are one of the largest tribes in Africa, with about thirty million individuals throughout
the region of Africa.25 To answer the question, Who are the Yorùbá, this is a deep and complex
task which goes beyond mere identification through a name. This is because several factors
contribute to make the Yorùbá who they are. As Olusanya writes,
There is probably no other African people who have commanded as much
attention of scholars of all disciplines as much as the Yorùbá. Their
physical environment, history, mythology, language, artistic traditions,
thought systems, social and political institutions, religion, moral and
aesthetic values, economic and medical systems in Africa and the
diaspora have been and continuing to be of great attention to scholars and
researchers.26 (Odusanya,1983:26)

The Yorùbá are regarded also as one of the most advanced communities in West Africa. Though
the question of the origin of the Yorùbá is still a debatable subject, a fact remains clear; the Yorùbá
are homogeneous in origin. Their language, in spite of its many dialects provides the main
evidence of a common origin and cultural heritage. This language spoken by many people within
and outside the shores of Nigeria is known as the Yorùbá language.
The Yoruba Human Ontology
The freewill problem premised on the position of neuroscience revolves round the issue of ‘selfawareness of causes of actions’, are we actually aware of the causes of our actions? Are we
actually conscious of processes that initiated what we call voluntary behavior? If indeed we are
not free as neuroscience seems to suggest, then our actions are beyond our control. Who takes
responsibility for our actions if indeed they are beyond our control? In the light of these germane
questions, one cannot discard the proven discovery of science because of the speculative but
established beliefs influenced by our religious, cultural or ethical ideas. Although, to a Yorùbá,
these beliefs are not just mere assumptions, they are still stern beliefs taken very seriously which
shapes the behaviors of the Yorùbá. Is it possible then to accept the conclusion of neuroscience
which threatens freewill and jeopardize the so-called assumptions of the Yorùbá on human
personality? This is an important question that has grave implications at a personal level and at
a communal level. It is therefore necessary to have a clear understanding of human personality
among the Yorùbá in order to understand the implications of a scientific finding on human will.
The focal point of the discourse at this point is the Yorùbá meaning of a “man” ènìyàn. This is not
necessarily a gender description of the male sex, but a generic expression of a human being.
A human being, according to Yorùbá belief system, is not just a mere physical being whose
existence is dictated alone by physical factors present in this world. According to Adebola
Akintola, at the stage of divine creation of man, there was a free intercourse between God and
the divinities, which predicated the creation of man in heaven and his subsequent establishment
on earth.27 It is necessary to note also that religion is dominant in the whole life of the Yorùbá.
Thus, the Yoruba conception of a human being is essentially religious. A human being is viewed
from the conception of her/his relation to the gods; her/his life in the existing state of living in this
world and human destiny in the after-life. All these are brought into the orbit of religious
conceptions.28 In order to understand the unique concept of human personality held by the
Yorùbá, there are some important factors that should be taken into consideration. These are the
beliefs which influence what constitute a human person and a number of different factors which
affect his/her existence or the quality of life on earth will also be examined. These are the belief
in the physical and non-physical nature of a human being, man’s preparation in heaven before
coming to the earth, the roles of God’s powerful agents in the world, the concepts of Orì, Ẹǹikejì,
man’s guardian angel or double, death and immortality of the soul of man. An understanding of
these beliefs is necessary in order to understand what to do with the conclusion of neuroscience
which threatens freewill in the Yorùbá view on human personality.
The Physical and Non-Physical Nature of a Human Being
The Yorùbá like many other peoples of the world are of the belief that the human nature is both
material and immaterial. The Yoruba belief is that a human being has the material body which is
used to live and interact in the physical world. They also hold the notion that there is also the non27

material body which interacts in the metaphysical sense.29 According to Adebowale Akintola, the
Yorùbá, taking their cue from Ọ̀ rúnmìlà, the fountain source of all wisdom, believe that man is not
just a biological phenomenon resulting from the reproductive mating of a male and female. He is
a created being, a product of the divine and creative will of Olódùmarè, the Supreme-being. Not
only the first man and the first woman (labeled Adam and Eve in Christian mythology) were
created beings; according to Ifá mythology, every child born into this world, till this present time,
has been individually created first (his spirit-personality having been created in heaven) only
chooses to move down to the earth for a temporary sojourn through the human regenerative
process. This also implies that a man’s sojourn on earth is merely a continuation of his earlier
activities in heaven.30 This belief that man is not only a biological phenomenon but also a spiritual
phenomenon whose sojourn on earth being a continuation of what began in heaven is only
possible if a human being has two natures; one physical and the other non-physical. Bolaji Idowu
has written extensively on the subject of the dual nature of man held by the Yorùbá31 to which
several other scholars make reference to internationally and locally.
On a similar note, Akintola holds also that the Yorùbá believe that man is made up of two parts -- viz the physical part created in a clay mould and the spiritual part which is the very eternal
essence of God, Olódùmarè Himself. This belief is substantiated thus, Olódùmarè sent Ikú (death
or morbidity divinity) to procure clay with which man’s body was to be moulded. Sàngó (alias
Àjàlá) moulded man’s head. To complete the body mould, Òrìsà-ńlá (God’s own representative
on earth) was assigned to give human shape to the mould, that is, shape of the mouth, nose, ears
and general human figuring. Finally, Olódùmarè, ordered all the divinities in attendance during
the creation ritual to close their eyes whilst He breathed His own essence, which is spirit, into the
nostrils of the moulded human body. This essence automatically makes man to become a living
man… a fully created being. It is in connection with the story that Ọ̀ rúnmìlà is depicted as a divinity
that knows it all. Ọ̀ rúnmìlà did not close his eyes fully; and so, with partially opened eyes, saw
Olódùmarè as He was breathing His spirit into man. Ọ̀ rúnmìlà alone saw Olódùmarè as He was
sharing His essence with carnal or earthly man--- hence, the saying, “Ọ̀ rúnmìlà, ẹlẹri Ìpín
(Ọ̀ rúnmìlà, witness to Olódùmarè’s sharing His spirit with humankind.32 Although in some cases,
the ìpín here is understood as allotment or portion which as to do with destiny. Bolaji Idowu holds
this view of ìpín which is slightly different from Akintola’s view because Idowu calls a person’
destiny Ìpín-Ori- the lot of Orí’s (Orí here does not only means physical head, but has a lot do with
destiny) portion or lot which he believes is usually abbreviated as Ìpín33. Regardless of whichever
meaning one wants to subscribe to, some facts remain valid in the two views, Ìpín has to do with
a person’s share or allotment, which could be a man’s share of the life of Olódùmarè, or a man’s
share of the ẹ̀ mí- spirit of Olódùmarè or a person’s allotment of his destiny. The main issue derived
from these beliefs is that the Yorùbá believe in the intangible aspect of the life of a person which
is the person’s share or allotment.
Idowu makes a clear distinction between ẹ̀mí spirit and èémí- breath. Ẹ̀mí is causative of breath
and the ‘breather’, that which breathes in man. This belief influences the saying regarding
someone who is just dead; ẹ̀mí rẹ ti bo- his ẹ̀ mí has slipped off, èéḿi ti tán nínú rè - there is no
more breath in him. Idowu says further that to the Yorùbá, there is more to man than just body
and spirit.34 Similarly, Ayo Salami, goes further to say that the Ẹ̀mí is housed by the Orí and that

Ẹ̀mí is not limited in time, energy and space. Hence, it could travel between many ends without
losing time. It is the same Emi that would return to heaven when the man dies. Ẹ̀mí cannot perish
at death, since it came from Olódùmarè, it has to return to Him at the death of a person. Ẹ̀mí is
spiritual and cannot be seen, it is intangible and can move from one place to another.35 This belief
of the Yorùbá is also held by Christians, who believe that man is a spirit and that the spirit move
from one place to another and that no one can understand the ways of the spirit except him that
is of the spirit.36 If the spirit can move from one place to the other, then it is in order to believe that
the spirit can attain different bodies. Adetunji holds this belief as a characteristic of Ẹ̀mí among
the Yorùbá. According to her, in Yorùbá witchcraft belief, it is held that the Ẹ̀mí of a witch
incarnates in physical form in animals such as a bird. And that if such a bird is caught and killed,
the witch automatically dies.37 This means the Ẹ̀mí can move from one place to the other without
its house, the human body but will need to assume another physical body such as animals like
birds or cats as seen in the case of witchcraft.
The general belief is that the Ẹ̀mí of people only leave their bodies at death. Is it then only the
Ẹ̀mí of witches that can move from one body to another while still living? Adetunji answers this
question in a way, she points out that the human body needs Ẹ̀mí to ‘enliven’ it, answering the
question- Can Ẹ̀mí exists without the body? She says, the human body is an important factor for
the existence of Ẹ̀mí. Ẹ̀mí is only man’s Ẹ̀mí when it is in man, outside the body it is not capable
of independent existence and also by the same token, the body without Ẹ̀mí is just cadaver.38
There is therefore a symbiotic relationship between the body (Ara) and the Spirit Ẹ̀mí, existence
is only possible when these two composite parts of a human being are functioning together.
Oladipo calls this relationship a “relationship that is made up of certain inter-locking elements,
these elements only come active when they are infused with the active life-giving spark, Ẹ̀mí.
Summarily, neither Ẹ̀ mí nor Ara, taken separately, each by itself can be said to be the human
person.39 The Ẹ̀mí is the important part of the dual nature of the human being that cannot be seen
while the physical part that houses the Ẹ̀mí is known as Ara or body which comprises of several
parts.
Ara is the Yorùbá conception of a human body, it is the composite element of a man that can be
seen, felt and that which moves from place to place. It is the means by which a person carries out
his/her activities in this world. It is also the major form of identifying a person, having peculiar
features of colour, height, weight, builds or frames which makes the process of identification
possible. This involves also a broad classification of gender which could be either male or female
identified by the genitals. Regardless of the gender, there are some general body parts which
make up the Ara of a person. It is interesting to note that to the Yorùbá, the different parts of Ara
are not just physical organs of the body, they have different metaphysical significances. The
human head is known as Orí, to the Yorùbá, Orí is not just a mere physical organ that comes in
different shapes and sizes; it is a symbol of deep metaphysical functions. Ọkàn- heart is another
bodily part which has both physical and spiritual significance. According to Lucas, the word Ọkàn
can be used in two different senses; firstly, the material heart and secondly, as a distinct entity
which he calls the “heart-soul” or the intelligent faculty responsible for human thoughts and

actions. The second sense is more important to the Yorùbá because it forms part of the
immaterial, imperishable and imperishable part of man. Lucas says further that “the Ọkàn is
believed to exist before a man’s birth which may be the Ọkàn of an ancestor or of any deceased
person. It may also be the Ọkàn of an abiku, that is “one that is born to die” and thereby causing
the child into which it has entered to die young.”40 Every part of the human body is important to
the Yorùbá both in the material and spiritual sense because to them a man is seen as having both
physical and non-physical nature.
Although the Yoruba cannot account for their religious or cultural views empirically, they are valid
because they serve a pragmatic purpose to the people concerned. However, taking the findings
of neuroscience literally as some philosophers do and maintaining that freewill is an illusion will
create a lot of problems because of its controversial conclusion. This is because neuroscience
offers only a materialistic understanding of man as it discusses the neurons and the cerebral
processes, whereas to a Yoruba, a Human being is more than these. Neuroscience fails to
acknowledge the metaphysical view of man held in Yorùbá religion. It is true that the cerebral
processes neuroscience offers its understanding is lacking within the religious or cultural view of
man, it is however not a holistic view.
The Yorùbá race is not an individualistic one that neuroscience tends to assume for all. The
Yorùbá do not believe in an individualistic existence that is why they say, Á dá se ní hun ọmọ, Ibà
kìí hun ọmọ. Solitary acts are doomed, but when a person honours- (elders and ancestors) such
acts are blessed. They also say- Ojú Méej̣̀i ló bí ọmọ, igba ènìyàn ló ń wò ó- Even though it is one
person that gives birth to a child, more than one person raise the child. Thus, to the Yoruba, a
person’s brain cannot decide for her/him because of the non-individualistic awareness the people
have.
Conclusion
History reveals to us that religion or culture often gives credence to scientific positions eventually
even in spite of the initial resistance to new findings which are at odds with its position. The
submission of neuroscience which is used as the premise to suggest that freewill does not exist
has serious implications in any civilized society. ‘Not having freewill’ is indeed a severe threat to
the established notion of responsibility firmly established in the Yorùbá religious and cultural
beliefs.
The freewill problem premised on the position of neuroscience revolves round the issue of
consciousness, which is also understood as ‘self-awareness of causes of actions’, making one to
wonder that are we actually aware of the causes of our actions? Or are we actually conscious of
processes that initiated what we call voluntary behavior? In spite of all the empirically verified truth
presented by neuroscience, there are some serious implications for the sustenance of this
discovery in the field of neuroscience on human freewill. If indeed we are not free, then our actions
are beyond our control. If our actions are beyond our control, then what are the religious, moral
and cultural implications of our actions? Who takes responsibility for our actions if indeed they are
beyond our control? What neuroscience seems to say is that there is the absence of
consciousness in the decision-making process. Absence of consciousness is then used as the
basis to conclude that there is no freewill. This study prefers to interpret the position of

neuroscience to mean we are neither in ‘full control’ of the processes of our decision making nor
are we truly autonomous as we believe, thus, it is pragmatic to conclude that freewill is compatible
with determinism. This position does not rob humans of their freedom entirely because they need
to take responsibility for their actions even though there are reasons to doubt if we are truly
humans or machines as neuroscience submits. However, in any human society like that of the
Yoruba, humans are not robots because in reality, people face the consequences of their actions.
Imagining a man to be a machine is an absurdity because a machine cannot fit into the ontology
of man as believed among the people. To a Yoruba, a human being is more metaphysical than
physical and the human will is a product of complex systems which cannot be reduced to only
systematic empirically verifiable means.

ABSTRACT
By the late nineteenth century, the scientiﬁc study of bedload transport had emerged as an oﬀshoot of hydraulics and geomorphology. Since then,
computing bedload transport rates has attracted considerable attention, but whereas other environmental sciences have seen their predictive capacities
grow over time, particularly thanks to increased computing power, engineers and scientists are unable to predict bedload transport rates to within
better than one order of magnitude. Why have we failed to improve our predictive capacity to any signiﬁcant degree? A commonly shared view is
that the study of bedload transport has more in common with the earth sciences than hydraulics: bedload transport rates depend on many processes
that vary nonlinearly, involve various time and space scales, and are interrelated to each other. All this makes it diﬃcult to view bedload as merely
particle transport in a turbulent ﬂow – something which can be studied in the laboratory in isolation from the natural environment. Over the last two
decades, more emphasis has been put on the noisy dynamics characterizing bedload transport. This Vision Paper makes a strong case for recognizing
noise (e.g. bedload transport rate ﬂuctuations) as an intrinsic feature of bedload transport. Improving our predictive capacities requires a better
understanding of the origins and nature of noise in bedload transport. This paper also reviews some of the challenges that need to be addressed in
current research and teaching.

Keywords: Bedload transport; bedload transport rate; history of hydraulics; morphodynamics; random motion; stochastic model
higher safety standards which more accurate predictions would
engender.
In this article’s companion paper (Ancey, 2020), I reviewed
the various approaches to computing bedload transport and bed
morphology. The present Vision Paper supplements this review,
shifting the focus from the state of the art to the hot questions
related to bedload transport theory. Among these questions are
the scientiﬁc challenges yet to be addressed in our search for
a better understanding of bedload transport and more accurate
predictions. However, some of the questions as to why progress
in our ﬁeld is so slow are sensitive ones. In a previous Vision
Paper devoted to bedload transport, Hager (2018) suggested
that “research progress slowed down some 40 years ago as the
advances were too small to generate adequate funding.” Not
many readers will object to this observation. Hydraulics – and
its oﬀshoots such as the study of bedload transport – is regarded
as an old-fashioned technical ﬁeld by the “science managers”
who rule academia today. I will not challenge Hager’s view on
the slowdown in the pace of discovery, but I will argue that
we are on the verge of creating a new paradigm in bedload

1 Introduction
The study of bedload transport is a lively, steadily developing ﬁeld of science, but it faces one longstanding thorny issue:
predicting bedload transport rates. After more than a century
of research, it is still diﬃcult to predict bedload transport
rates more accurately than to within one order of magnitude
(Recking, 2013a; Recking, Liébault, Peteuil, & Jolimet, 2012).
A closely related problem is predicting the evolution of bed
morphology. The twin problems of computing bedload transport rates and bed morphology are of paramount signiﬁcance
to a wide range of engineering and ecological issues (e.g. river
and habitat restoration, ﬂood protection, land use planning, risk
analysis, water resources and biodiversity). The costs incurred
in river management are huge. In Switzerland alone, ﬂoods
involving bedload transport cause mean annual property damage
of CHF 125 million (0.2% of the annual Swiss federal budget) (Badoux, Andres, & Turowski, 2014). The development
of more accurate morphodynamic models could have a major
societal impact, including the substantial ﬁnancial savings and

2 Are there really noisy dynamics?
To substantiate this Vision Paper’s content and to give it a
personal touch, I start with laboratory and ﬁeld data showing
the signiﬁcance of ﬂuctuations in bedload transport rates. This
will be the guiding theme throughout the paper. I will provide
two examples. The ﬁrst involves a typical laboratory experiment: an inclined ﬂume is fed with sediment and water, and
we wish to measure the bedload transport rate at the ﬂume outlet. The key question is how long we will have to wait for an
accurate estimate of the mean bedload transport rate Q̄s when
recording the instantaneous transport rate Qs at the ﬂume outlet. Figure 1a shows how the bedload transport rate Qs varies
with time t at the outlet of a 19-m-long ﬂume under steady-state
conditions (constant water discharge Qw and sediment feed rate
Qin ). Fluctuations as large as 10Qin occurred over the experiment duration (585 h). This ﬂuctuating behaviour substantially
aﬀects the value of the mean transport rate. Figure
 T 1b shows how
the time-averaged transport rate Q̄s (T) = 0 Qs (t) dt/T varies
as a function of the sampling time T. Because of the huge
ﬂuctuations in Qs , the time needed to obtain the mean sediment transport rate Q̄s to within 5% is very long (about 210 h).
Measuring Q̄s over short lengths of time (e.g. a few minutes, as
in many experimental protocols) could lead to errors of 100%.

The second example shows ﬁeld data collected on the
Navisence, a mountain river in the Canton du Valais (Switzerland), which has been monitored since 2011 (Ancey, Bohorquez,
& Bardou, 2014). Since monitoring began, the river has experienced a wide range of ﬂow conditions, from low to intense
sediment transport and two major ﬂoods, in 2013 and 2018.
Transport rates were measured using geophones placed across
a concrete sill of width W = 9 m (Wyss et al., 2016). The mean
bed slope upstream of the sill is i = 3.2%. Like most mountain
rivers, the Navisence ﬂows over a bed of grains with a wide size
distribution: d30 = 2 cm, d50 = 8 cm, and d84 = 30 cm, where
dx is a characteristic particle size such that x% of the sediment
(in volume) is ﬁner than dx . See the electronic supplement for
further information.
Figure 2a shows that the (dimensionless) transport rate varied
over two orders of magnitude at low ﬂow rates, and even during
intense ﬂoods these rates exhibited large ﬂuctuations covering
one order of magnitude. It is tempting to compare these data
with extant bedload transport equations. To that end, I have
scaled the particle transport rate Qs and the bed shear stress:

water density), and Rh = Wh/(W + 2h) is the hydraulic radius
(h is water ﬂow depth). The representative diameter dx is

conﬁdence interval. We also show the empirical bedload transport equation proposed by Recking (2013b) and the MPM-like Eq. (2) proposed by
Wong and Parker (2006). For Recking’s equation, I considered two ways of computing the Shields stress , either: (i) using the deﬁnition Eq. (1),
where I used the recorded ﬂow depth; or (ii) using Recking’s ﬂow resistance Eq. (4). (b) The bedload transport rate Qs as a function of the water

commonly assumed to be the median diameter d50 , but recent
studies suggest that for mixtures made up of ﬁne and coarse
sediment, d84 is a better choice (Recking, 2013a). I have plotted
two empirical bedload transport equations. The ﬁrst is a variant
of the Meyer-Peter–Müller (MPM) Eq. (6) obtained by Wong
and Parker (2006) after recompiling experimental data:
Φ = 4.93(Θ − Θc )1.6

(2)

where Θc = 0.047 denotes the dimensionless critical Shields
stress (related to incipient motion). This variant of the original
MPM Eq. (6) is assumed to be better suited to gravel-bed rivers
with a slope in excess of 2%. The second equation was derived
by Recking (2013b):
Φ=

1 + (Θc /Θ)4

√

with Θc = (5i + 0.06)(d84 /d50 )4.4 i−1.5 . Recking (2013b) suggested two ways of computing the Shields stress Θ, either: (i) by
using the deﬁnition Eq. (1) when information on h is available;
or (ii) by taking this empirical equation reﬂecting ﬂow resistance
in coarse-bed rivers:
Θ=

(s − 1)d90 2/W + 74p 2.6 (gi)p q−2p d90



(4)

with p = 0.23 and q = Qw /W. Figure 2a shows that Recking’s
Eq. (3) closely matches the mean bedload transport rate curve,

whereas Eq. (2) shows no agreement between the MPM’s predictions and ﬁeld data because of the value of Θc . In the log–log
representation of Fig. 2a, Recking’s equation seems to do a
good job of predicting the bedload transport rate, with relative errors mostly lower than 100%, but these errors are more
signiﬁcant at intermediate transport rates: a factor of three for
Θ ∼ 0.03. How the Shields stress Θ is deﬁned makes the diﬀerence at high transport rates: using the empirical ﬂow resistance
Eq. (4) leads to errors up to a factor of three, whereas using
the deﬁnition Eq. (1) leads to excellent agreement. When working with dimensional variables and comparing ﬁeld data and
empirical equations, the choice of the representative diameter is
decisive. As shown by Fig. 2b, using the MPM-like Eq. (2) with
dx = d90 in the deﬁnition of Θ in Eq. (1) leads to errors ranging
from two to three orders of magnitude. A power-law function ﬁtted to the data Q̄s = cQ3w shows that despite large ﬂuctuations,
the mean transport rate is well correlated with water discharge
Qw . As found in a number of ﬁeld investigations (Barry, Buﬀington, & King, 2004; Rickenmann, 2018), the dependence of
Qs on Qw is more pronounced than that given by classic bedload equations, such as the MPM Eq. (6). Not only does this
empirical equation fail to capture the right order of magnitude
for Q̄s but it also miscalculates terribly when computing the total
amount of sediment transported by the river.
These two examples show that bedload transport ﬂuctuations are a ubiquitous feature of bedload transport rate records.
The existence of wide ﬂuctuations calls into question the very
deﬁnition of the mean transport rate Q̄s and suggests that
timescales associated with Qs variations be more carefully

considered. Questions around the deﬁnition of Q̄s have as yet
received no consensual answer. We are at a crossroads. We could
continue to ignore the part played by ﬂuctuations in bedload
transport; after all, many physical systems (e.g. gases, turbulent ﬂows) exhibit ﬂuctuations at the microscopic scale, but their
macroscopic behaviours can be described using deterministic
principles alone. Conversely, we could consider that the dynamics of bedload transport cannot be modelled without a proper
understanding of how ﬂuctuations are created and how they
aﬀect bulk dynamics. Admittedly, turbulence can be described
using empirical laws such as the Prandtl mixing layer concept,
but all the modern theories of turbulence have aimed to provide
a reﬁned quantitative description and more accurate predictions
of ﬂows. The cornerstone of their modelling is the recognition
that velocity ﬂuctuation has a role in generating bulk stress.
3 A brief historical outlook
3.1

The hydraulic perspective

Paul du Boys is credited with the ﬁrst (heuristic) attempt to predict bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. By viewing bedload
transport as sliding layers of grains, he developed an equation
that provides the bedload transport rate qs per unit width as a
function of the bottom shear stress τb (du Boys, 1879):
qs = χ τb (τb − τc )

(5)

where τc is the critical shear stress above which layers start
sliding, and χ is a material coeﬃcient. His work would probably have been forgotten had Grove Karl Gilbert not given him
credit, a few decades later, for his ground-breaking concepts
on moving particle layers and tractive force, in a seminal work
on sediment transport (Gilbert & Murphy, 1914). Thus, Eq. (5)
contains two key elements that have commonly been used in
bedload transport models since then: (i) bedload transport only
occurs when bottom drag exceeds a critical value (an idea then
formalized by Shields, 1936); and (ii) the bedload transport
rate is a nonlinear function of the bottom shear stress. The
latter element had long been debated. Scientists such as Schoklitsch (1934) and Bagnold (1980) argued that the key hydraulic
variable should be the water discharge or stream power rather
than the bottom shear stress. Laboratory experiments have conﬁrmed that the bedload transport rate varies as a power-law
function of the bottom shear stress, but not quadratically as in
Eq. (5). For instance, in the commonly used MPM equation, the
3/2
bedload transport rate varies as τb . In the absence of correction
factors, the MPM equation can be written in a dimensionless
form:
 3/2

(6)
Φ = 8 Θ − Θc∗
where Θc∗ = 0.047 is the critical Shields stress and d = d50 is
the median particle diameter to be used in the deﬁnition of the
Shields stress Θ in Eq. (1) (e.g. Wong & Parker, 2006).

21

Empirical approaches epitomized by the MPM Eq. (6)
assume the bedload transport rate to be structurally dependent
on hydraulic variables and then ﬁt the resulting equation to laboratory data. Although the empirical equations were satisfactory
when tested using laboratory data, it quickly appeared that they
agreed poorly with ﬁeld data (Gomez, 1991). This observation
has led to two radically diﬀerent strategies for improving the
predictive capacity of bedload equations. For scientists such as
Eugen Meyer-Peter, reﬁning the bedload equation by involving
more dependent variables (e.g. grain size) should lead to more
accurate equations. For other scientists, better accuracy meant
a better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in
bedload transport. New ideas about particle entrainment and
transport emerged between the mid-1930s and the late 1940s.
Among the various theoretical approaches to bedload transport, two ideas developed in the 1940s have attracted the most
attention:
• For Hans Albert Einstein, bedload transport reﬂected the
random nature of particle paths and exchanges between the
bed and stream (Einstein, 1950). For steady, uniform ﬂows,
bedload transport rates could be calculated by matching the
entrainment and deposition rates of particles. When the water
discharge was increased, the bottom drag increased and ﬂuctuated more widely, causing more particles to be entrained.
It was Einstein’s view that the main driver of bedload transport was the number of particles entrained. The mean bedload
transport rate is deﬁned as q̄s = E l̄ where E denotes the particle entrainment rate, and l̄ is the mean distance travelled by
a particle between two resting phases.
• For his main theoretical challenger, Anton Kalinske, the main
driver was particle velocity. Once entrained by the ﬂow, particles moved at the velocity imposed by the ﬂuid velocity
distribution (Kalinske, 1947). As the number of moving particles was assumed to be constant, any variation in the bedload
transport rate was related to changes in the particle velocity.
Kalinske (1947) deﬁned the mean bedload transport rate from
the particle activity (that is, the volume of particles in motion
per unit streambed area) γ and the mean particle velocity ūp :
q̄s = γ ūp .
Einstein is often credited as the father of stochastic models of
bedload transport. Although he used probabilistic concepts – as
did Kalinske – his bedload equation is purely deterministic. The
two viewpoints seem incompatible at ﬁrst sight, but as shown by
Furbish, Fathel, Schmeeckle, Jerolmack, and Schumer (2017),
there are dual deﬁnitions of the bedload transport rate, which
can be expressed as a function of particle activity γ or of the
entrainment rate E (see also Section 4.4 in Ancey, 2020).
In the decades following Einstein’s and Kalinske’s contributions, various ideas were explored to infer the bedload transport
rate qs from the mean behaviour of particles (Ali & Dey, 2019).
For instance, Wiberg and Smith (1989) and Niño and García (1994) used Kalinske’s deﬁnition qs = γ ūp , and calculated

22

C. Ancey

the particle velocity ūp from the mean force balance (including
drag and gravitational forces, and bed friction). Particle activity was deduced from Bagnold’s assumption, which states that
the excess stress τb − τc between the bottom shear stress and
critical stress is associated with the energy u∗ (τb − τc ) that is
√
available to dislodge and move particles (u∗ = τb /ρ is the
friction velocity). This approach has gradually been abandoned.
Seminara, Solari, and Parker (2002) showed that Bagnold’s
assumption was ﬂawed. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that bedload transport rate ﬂuctuations arise mainly from
variations in particle activity rather than from mean particle
velocity.
Was Einstein’s intuition on the random nature of bedload
transport just a ﬂash in the pan? Although they were ignored
for decades, the 2000s saw a revival of interest in the ﬂuctuations of bedload transport and in bed morphology. As this
article’s companion paper reviewed the research done since
the 2000s, I will simply outline the main directions of that
research. Parker, Paola, and Leclair (2000) reformulated the
Exner equation in probabilistic terms, opening the way for
river morphodynamic models that are able to account for the
eﬀects of randomly distributed bed elevations on deposition and
entrainment rates (Blom, 2008; Pelosi, Schumer, Parker, & Ferguson, 2016). David Furbish and his co-workers used statistical
mechanics methods to show how particle entrainment, deposition and displacement are interrelated physically. Their work
has shown that the random nature of particle displacements
induces a Fick-like gradient in the particle ﬂux. Consequently,
the bedload transport rate is not only related to the particle
ﬂux γ ūp but also to its gradient (Furbish et al., 2017; Furbish, Haﬀ, Roseberry, & Schmeeckle, 2012). My colleagues
and I have made an analogy with population dynamics (deposition being similar to death, entrainment to birth and displacement to migration) and used the corresponding framework of
jump Markov processes (Ancey, Bohorquez, & Heyman, 2015;
Ancey & Heyman, 2014). Using this approach, the occurrence
of large (non-Gaussian) Qs ﬂuctuations resulted from a positive feedback mechanism in particle entrainment. As Furbish
et al. (2012) showed in their statistical approach, we have found
that deﬁning the mean bedload transport rate Q̄s over a control
volume involves both the particle ﬂux γ ūp (as Kaslinske deﬁned
it) and a ﬂuctuating part that looks like particle diﬀusion (Ancey
et al., 2015).
3.2

Views inspired from the literature on geomorphology

Within the hydraulics community, sediment transport has often
been regarded as an isolated system whose variations are solely
dictated by the water ﬂow. As summarized by Church and
Ferguson (2015), “the channel was regarded as a ﬁxed container
within which the ﬂow set the conditions for transport”. The
geomorphology community has considered the broader physical picture, looking at sediment transport over larger scales of
space and time. Sediment transport is just one of the numerous

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

processes involved in landscape dynamics. As we will see,
eﬀorts have been made to bridge the gap between the two
perspectives.
The design of stable channels – that is, unlined earth channels
“the banks and bed of which are not scoured objectionably by
the moving water, and in which objectionable deposits of sediment do not occur” (Lane, 1955a, p. 1235) – gained considerable
attention in the twentieth century because of increased settlement on ﬂoodplains. In the early part of the twentieth century,
geomorphologists such as William Davis, Grove Karl Gilbert,
Hoover Mackin and Leopold Lunn had started to think about
river morphology. Sediment production (erosion), transport and
deposition were addressed over larger scales of space and time.
Special attention was paid to how the entire landscape was
shaped by erosion and sediment transport, and how river morphology adapted to the constraints imposed by topography and
sediment. Morphological processes were described and classiﬁed (Schumm, 2005). Geomorphologists also deﬁned a number
of important concepts such as capacity, competence, equilibrium and grade (Gilbert & Murphy, 1914; Mackin, 1948). Many
of the concepts deﬁned by geomorphologists are still avidly discussed due to the lack of a consensual quantitative framework
(Phillips, 2011).
The concept of graded rivers is especially signiﬁcant to
hydraulic engineering because it is closely related to the design
of stable channels. Mackin (1948, p. 464) deﬁned a graded river
as:
one in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted
to provide, with available discharge and with prevailing channel
characteristics, just the velocity required for the transportation of
the load supplied from the drainage basin. The graded stream is
a system in equilibrium; its diagnostic characteristic is that any
change in any of the controlling factors will cause a displacement of the equilibrium in a direction that will tend to absorb the
eﬀect of the change.

Emory Lane gave a quantitative translation to this deﬁnition,
today known as Lane’s balance (Lane, 1955b):
Qs d ∝ Qw i

(7)

that is, the channel adjusts to balance sediment load Qs and
water discharge Qw . In Lane’s view, this equation was not a
law that described bed equilibrium, but rather a mathematical
expression that qualitatively indicated “the changes which will
take place in a stream when a change of any one of the variables occurs” (Lane, 1955b). Although Lane’s Eq. (7) supports
the idea of an interplay between bed morphology, bedload and
water discharge, in quantitative and sensitive terms, it remains
rather vague about the underlying mechanisms. It is unclear
over which temporal and spatial scales this condition of bed
equilibrium holds true. Another criticism of the concept of
bed equilibrium is the very existence of a goal function that
would push the stream to reach equilibrium: admittedly, for
humans, the river’s role is to transport water and sediment,
but there is no speciﬁc reason why a river would maximize its

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

Bedload transport

transport capacity and seek to maintain its bed at equilibrium
(Phillips, 2010).
A key question is whether we can move one step further
along the trail marked by Emory Lane. It was noted very
early on in ﬁeld investigations that both man-made and natural alluvial channel geometries showed a certain consistency
when one tried to compare their channel width, depth and
bed slope to bankfull discharge (e.g. Gleason, 2015; Julien &
Wargadalam, 1995). This led to the formulation of the regime
concept (closely related to the grade concept) (Graf, 1984).
Although cross-sections may vary considerably from one river
to another, the following scalings have been found for channel
width W, ﬂow depth h and velocity ū:
W ∝ Qαw , h ∝ Qαh ,

and

ū ∝ Qαu

(8)

where Q is the bankfull discharge (also called the channelforming discharge), αw ∼ 1/2, αh ∼ 1/3 and αu ∼ 1/6 (Gleason, 2015; Graf, 1984). The robustness and universality of these
scalings have long intrigued scientists, who have tried to discover the channel self-adjustment mechanisms hidden behind
them using rational arguments (e.g. shear stress redistribution,
see Parker, 1978) or the principle of maximization/minimization
of an ad hoc functional (Davies & Sutherland, 1983; Nanson & Huang, 2008), a principle often criticized for being
unphysical (Gray, Ghidaoui, & Karney, 2018). Combining various scaling relationships, Parker (1979) proposed the following
bedload transport equation for a straight gravel-bed river:
Φ=

qs
(

− 1)gd3

= 11.2

(Θ − 0.03)9/2
Θ3

(9)

23

which shows remarkable agreement with Einstein’s bedload
transport equation, as shown by Fig. 3 (see Eq. (11) in the companion paper for the deﬁnition of Einstein’s equation). Reﬁning
the regime equations by taking sediment size into account,
Julien (2002) revisited the Lane balance equation and obtained:
Qs d0.28 = 9.1Q1.11 i1.44

(10)

for channels whose ﬂow resistance can be described using
the Manning–Strickler equation. The agreement between the
dimensionless form of Eq. (10), Parker’s Eq. (9) and the MPM
Eq. (6) shown in Fig. 3 stems from the speciﬁc assumption used
by Julien (2002) and Parker (1978).
The apparent behaviour of the power-law Eqs (8) of the ﬂow
variables has fascinated some scientists. However, it has been
noted that the respective exponents in those power-law Eqs (8)
vary from one author to another, depending on the dataset, river
features and the ﬁtting protocol (particularly how bankfull discharge is deﬁned) (Gleason, 2015). In the absence of an underlying theory explaining why the ﬂow variables scale with some
measure of water discharge, the trends displayed by Eqs (8)
may be more accidental than the tell-tale sign of a universal
mechanism of channel formation. Many complex physical and
biological systems exhibit power-law behaviours, but they often
arise from unspeciﬁed reasons, for instance when the variable of
interest is a by-product of mixing multiple heavy-tailed distributions (Stumpf & Porter, 2012). Various eﬀorts have nevertheless
aimed at developing this understanding without recourse to
ad hoc assumptions. For instance, Parker, Wilcock, Paola, Dietrich, and Pitlick (2007) showed that for straight gravel-bed
rivers, the power-law behaviours Eqs (8) were the natural

curve) to adjust Lane’s Eq. (10)

consequences of ﬂow resistance, sediment transport and the
threshold of incipient motion.
Although geomorphologists have mostly regarded bedload
transport as a mechanism of bed equilibrium (Phillips, 2010),
some have begun to consider rivers to be closer to punctuated
equilibrium systems than to stable systems satisfying Lane’s
balance in Eqs (8). Indeed, on suﬃciently large spatial and
temporal scales, rivers experience bursts of bedload transport
with rapid changes in bed morphology over short time intervals
interrupted by long periods of weak activity (stasis). Turbulence and self-organized critical systems have served as an
analogue means of studying how a physical, noise-driven system adapts to external changes (Jerolmack & Paola, 2010).
Similar views developed in hydraulics from the 1970s onward,
when it was realized that a river bed’s response to an external
change was associated with a much longer timescale than the
one characterizing water ﬂow (Cunge & Perdreau, 1973). This
led to morphodynamic models governed by the Exner equation,
which describes how the bed evolves to balance the diﬀerence between the volumes of entrained and deposited sediment
(Lanzoni & Seminara, 2002).

4 Open questions and prospects
4.1

Where are we today?

With advances in computational power and reﬁned numerical
models, sciences such as meteorology have steadily increased
their predictive capabilities (Bauer, Thorpe, & Brunet, 2015).
But what about hydraulics? Returning to the example in Fig. 2,
one cannot but be amazed by the deviation between the trend
shown by the ﬁeld data Qs ∝ Q3w and an MPM-like bedload
transport equation Qs ∝ Qw . Field surveys in other gravel-bed
rivers have shown similar deviations between ﬁeld data and
empirical bedload equations (Barry et al., 2004; Recking, 2010;
Recking et al., 2012; Rickenmann, 2018) of up to as large as one
order of magnitude. Various explanations have been suggested,
including the poor performance of empirical equations at capturing low sediment transport rates (near the threshold of incipient
motion), the eﬀect of grain sorting, surface processes such as
bed armouring, the bedload transport rate’s nonlinear dependence on ﬂow rate and bed geometry, variations in sediment
supply, and the eﬀects of migrating bedforms (Recking, 2012;
Yager, Venditti, Smith, & Schmeeckle, 2019). Yet, when recording high-resolution data over long periods, even simple ﬂume
experiments (without additional elements of complexity such as
grain sorting) reveal the poor match between empirical bedload
equations and the data. Figure 1a is a case in point: the ﬂuctuations of qs are so wide that it is hard to be convinced that
a simple relationship qs = qs (qw ) can emerge from them. In a
3/2
nutshell, on the one hand, the scaling of qs ∝ qw or qs ∝ τb
have been consistently demonstrated by many laboratory experiments and numerical simulations since the 1930s. On the other
hand, the coeﬃcient of proportionality varies considerably from

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

one laboratory experiment to another, and the exponent of the
scaling can also vary signiﬁcantly, especially when considering
ﬁeld data (Fig. 2).
One could legitimately wonder whether the present situation is much diﬀerent from that of a nineteenth-century scientist,
who, armed only with the Navier–Stokes equations and ignorant
of what turbulence meant, might try to calculate the ﬂow rate
in a water stream. Naturally, the scientist’s governing equations
would have been correct, but velocity ﬂuctuations make calculations extremely diﬃcult. Approximations such as Prandtl’s
mixing length are a ﬁrst step towards calculating the ﬂow properties of turbulent ﬂows. Returning to bedload transport, we are
faced with three questions which have received few answers to
date. First, is bedload transport driven by ﬂuctuations? Second,
if so, does this hold for all transport regimes? And third, as with
closure equations for estimating turbulent viscosity, is it possible
to relate the ﬂuctuating components to the mean ﬂow’s properties? If we follow Furbish et al. (2017) and other authors, the
tentative answers would be the following:
• First, bedload transport is essentially a noise-driven process at
low transport rates. The mean bedload transport rate qs   =
γ up   cannot be related solely to the mean ﬂow properties
(that is, the ﬂow depth and mean velocity).
• Second, this has been shown for transport conditions referred
by Furbish to as “rareﬁed”. The part played by ﬂuctuations at
high transport rates is less documented.
• Third, the transport rate’s ﬂuctuating part γ  up   can be
related to local ﬂow properties through a Fick-like law:
γ  up   = −∂x (Dr ūp ) (Section 4 in Ancey, 2019). Ancey
and Heyman (2014) found the same result using a diﬀerent
approach. The existence of a particle ﬂux gradient has important consequences in morphodynamic models, especially with
regards to the development of bedforms arising from ﬂow
instabilities (Bohorquez & Ancey, 2015, 2016).
Although there is a growing number of papers dealing with bedload transport ﬂuctuations, few scientists and engineers show
awareness of the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations on bedload transport.
Experimental protocols are a case in point: authors have often
mentioned that they measured qs by taking the time average of
the particle ﬂux at the ﬂume outlet, but Fig. 1b and ﬁeld surveys (Bunte & Abt, 2005) have shown that their convergence
to the mean value was usually slow. Other authors have mentioned that they waited until bed equilibrium had been reached,
but in a context where everything ﬂuctuates slowly, what does
“bed equilibrium” mean? A look at recent guidelines and textbooks shows that the problem of ﬂuctuations is almost never
mentioned, although it may be the very essence of sediment
transport, at least for some of its regimes.
4.2 Additional elements of complexity
The present paper provides a simpliﬁed physical picture of bedload transport. Numerous processes have been left aside despite

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

their signiﬁcance. The interplay between turbulence and sediment transport is certainly one of the most signiﬁcant and the
one that has attracted the most attention. I believe that disentangling how near-bed turbulence and bed structure aﬀect
bedload transport remains the single most signiﬁcant challenge
in the ﬁeld. Interestingly, however, there is one issue which
has received some partial answers and is connected with the
above discussion on whether bedload transport is essentially a
deterministic or stochastic process:
• On the one hand, several authors have developed analytical
models for studying the conditions under which an individual particle exposed to a turbulent ﬂow stays at equilibrium (Maurin, Chauchat, & Frey, 2018; Yager, Schmeeckle,
& Badoux, 2018). This is a longstanding issue related to
Shields’ criterion of incipient motion. In these models, the
authors ignored hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations induced by turbulence and used mean values for the driving and resisting forces; they were able to provide realistic estimates of
Shields’ critical shear stress (Yager et al., 2018).
• On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence to show
that particle entrainment is caused by drag and lift force
ﬂuctuations (not only their instantaneous values but also
their durations) (Cameron, Nikora, & Marusic, 2019; Keylock, Lane, & Richards, 2014; Lamb, Brun, & Fuller, 2017b;
Schmeeckle, Nelson, & Shreve, 2007; Valyrakis, Diplas,
& Dancey, 2013).
Naturally, these two viewpoints are not incompatible. Because
the force ﬂuctuations are correlated with the friction velocity u∗
in many ﬂow geometries, the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations can implicitly be incorporated into the drag and lift force coeﬃcients.
This link is not universal, however, as it depends crucially
on bed roughness and bedforms. Stress-partitioning approaches
have had some success in evaluating the relative parts played
by particles and bedforms in near-bed turbulence (Scheingross,
Winchell, Lamb, & Dietrich, 2013; Yager, Dietrich, Kirchner,
& McArdell, 2012), but the physical picture is far from being
comprehensive, notably for slopes exceeding 1%, for which
ﬂow shallowness and bed coarseness make turbulence more
complex (Lamb, Brun, & Fuller, 2017a).
Several complexities are related to the eﬀects of particle size
variability. When the bed material is graded, ﬁner particles are
more easily entrained than coarser particles, and this has two
major consequences: the development of armoured beds and
the partial mobility of particles under low to moderate ﬂow
conditions (Parker & Toro-Escobar, 2002). Following on from
Einstein’s concept of hiding function and size-fraction calculation in bedload transport rates, a number of authors have tried
to implement simple methods for taking size distribution into
account. More recently, the growing perception that bedload
transport is a granular ﬂow has given a new impetus to research
on grain sorting (Houssais & Jerolmack, 2016). In the ﬁeld
of granular ﬂows, grain sorting is called particle segregation,

Bedload transport

25

and it plays a signiﬁcant role in the dynamics of those ﬂows,
for example, by promoting levee formation, self-channelization,
mobility feedback and accumulation of coarse particles at the
front (Gray, 2018). A few mechanisms have been identiﬁed at
the particle scale, such as kinetic sieving and squeeze expulsion
(small particles fall into gaps that open up beneath them during
shear whereas larger particles are squeezed upwards), but understanding of these mechanisms is still only partial. At the bulk
scale, segregation can be described using nonlinear advection–
diﬀusion equations (Gray, 2018). Extending segregation theory
to bedload is attracting growing interest, but this is far from
being a simple exercise. One major obstacle is the continuum
assumption used in the segregation theory for granular ﬂows: for
bedload transport, particles move individually or in the form of
thin ﬂows (a few particle diameters in thickness), which makes
the assumption of a continuum less realistic. Grain sorting is
undoubtedly the great challenge of the years ahead.
Hydraulic engineers are prone to reducing rivers to surface ﬂows, but they are more complex systems, interacting
with the atmosphere, vegetation and groundwater (Brunner,
Therrien, Renard, Simmons, & Hendricks Franssen, 2017; Gurnell, Bertoldi, Tockner, Wharton, & Zolezzi, 2016). Subsurface
ﬂow – primarily hyporheic ﬂow – aﬀects bedload transport
by creating pressure ﬂuctuations (Smart & Habersack, 2007;
Tonina & Buﬃngton, 2009), modifying near-bed turbulence
(Lamb et al., 2017a; Sinha, Hardy, Blois, Best, & Sambrook
Smith, 2017), interacting with bedforms (Bray & Dunne, 2017;
Stonedahl, Harvey, & Packman, 2013) and causing water discharge to vary along the streambed. There is much work to be
done on subsurface ﬂows.
4.3 Links with morphodynamics
An examination of the technical literature on morphodynamics
shows the predominance of theories based on stability analysis. In the companion paper (Section 3.2), we showed that
stability analysis successfully predicts the development and
migration of dunes and anti-dunes when bottom shear stress
and depth-averaged velocity exhibit a phase lag. In Section 4 of
the companion paper (Ancey, 2020), we saw that recent models based on mass balance considerations lead to the desired
phase lag and provide consistent predictions. Stability analysis
has also been applied to predict other bed morphologies (such
as gravel bars, channel bifurcation and river meandering) with
varying degrees of success depending on channel geometry and
the timescales for water discharge and bank and bed evolution
(e.g. Bolla Pittaluga, Coco, & Kleinhans, 2015; Redolﬁ, Zolezzi,
& Tubino, 2016).
Not all bedforms arise from hydrodynamic instabilities, however. Many physical and biological systems have a ﬁne-grained
architecture (Cross & Greenside, 2009) made up of large numbers of simple elements that interact with each other through
a limited number of rules. Physicists have imagined a simple representation of these systems in the form of cellular

26

C. Ancey

automata, that is, grids in which the cells evolve in response
to the (discrete) states in their local neighbourhood. Cellular
automata exhibit macroscopic patterns, which can persist for
a long time or die out quickly and which can move around
and interact with each other. In other words, cellular automata
organize themselves, and macroscopic behaviour may emerge
from a simple micro-behaviour follow with its own logic.
Murray and Paola (1994) developed a cellular model to explain
the development of braided rivers, and their work was followed up by several teams interested in modelling braided
river or landscape dynamics (Coulthard & Van De Wiel, 2012).
Although cellular automata successfully mimic landform morphologies, they perform poorly at predicting bedload transport
rates and morphodynamics: cells redistribute masses of water
and grains but not their momentum, and computations are sensitive to local bed slope (Williams, Brasington, & Hicks, 2016).
One evolution of this approach has been to combine cellular automata with hydraulic models (Coulthard & Van De
Wiel, 2012), and an interesting feature of these models is their
deterministic chaos, a property well known by complex-system
physicists – even governed by deterministic rules, cells quickly
develop chaotic patterns. These morphological ﬂuctuations are
diﬀerent from those studied in stochastic models (Section 4 in
the companion paper), which reﬂect the random nature of particle motion. The question arises as to whether these diﬀerent
viewpoints are compatible and can be placed under a single
umbrella theory.
More recently, authors such as Grégoire Mariéthoz and
Philippe Renard have suggested that ﬂow patterns such as
meandering and braiding rivers can be generated using genetic
algorithms that do not need prior knowledge of the rules of
interaction between cells (Pirot, Straubhaar, & Renard, 2014).
Using a method based on multiple-point statistics (extending
kriging techniques based on two-point statistics) they were able
to generate structured patterns that were statistically consistent with a “training image” of a river. This resembled the
algorithm presented by Shannon (1948), whose introduction to
information theory showed how to generate a text in English
by combining words randomly selected from a book. After a
few iterations, the text was grammatically correct even though
the meaning was obscure. Shannon’s algorithm (and subsequent
methods based on random selection and recombination, such as
the Metropolis–Hastings and genetic algorithms) raises fascinating questions when applied to natural processes. When looking
at these processes at the bulk scale, where is the limit between
random-looking and structured patterns? Do we need physicsbased models to provide realistic predictions? What physical
insights can be gained from the “random order” featured in bed
geometries? Redolﬁ, Tubino, Bertoldi, and Brasington (2016)
recently provided a tentative answer by showing that the irregular cross-sections in multiple-channel rivers were statistically
equivalent to a single channel whose section satisﬁes the powerlaw function b = kdα , where b is the free-surface width (wetted
width), h is the ﬂow depth, and k and α are two parameters.

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

They then calculated the bedload transport rate in this synthetic
channel, and their experimental results agreed well with theory. Closely related methods are those based on maximum
entropy (Furbish, Schmeeckle, Schumer, & Fathel, 2016) and
Bayesian inference (Schmelter, Erwin, & Wilcock, 2012). One
strength of entropy-based methods is their use of the physical
information conveyed by data, thereby enforcing physical consistency. These studies have opened up new avenues of research
combining statistical information and physics-based models.
As high-resolution ﬁeld survey data are increasingly available
(LiDAR, structure from motion video, photogrammetry, laser
scanning, etc.), data-driven approaches (e.g. machine-learning
algorithms) are likely to be the next important stage in the development of bedload transport models. Not only do they oﬀer the
possibility of quantifying a model’s uncertainties and calibrating its parameters, but they can also be used to reduce those
uncertainties and, possibly, to reveal the missing elements in our
physical understanding of bedload transport. Similar eﬀorts are
being made in other ﬁelds of physics, for instance in turbulence
(Duraisamy, Iaccarino, & Xiao, 2019).
5 Further thoughts
5.1 Are we really lagging behind?
A look at recent forum papers and commentaries on hydraulics
(and related ﬁelds) reveals the scientiﬁc community’s growing concern about the slowdown in the pace of discoveries
(Hager, 2018; Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2017). In the words of Sivapalan and Blöschl, we have entered an era of disenchantment.
For those of us with academic responsibilities, required to seek
ﬁnancial support, take part in the recruitment of professors and
sit on thesis juries, or in contact with university deans and the
stakeholders in funding agencies, there has been a considerable
change in how hydraulics is perceived by people outside the
ﬁeld, and it has not been a positive one. Hydraulics – and in turn
its oﬀshoots like bedload transport – has increasingly been considered an ageing ﬁeld, one which can be relegated to colleges of
higher education. In many universities, hydraulic facilities have
been dismantled, retiring hydraulics professors have not been
replaced, technical staﬀ has been reduced, promotions delayed
and budgets cut.
The history of science has shown that knowledge accumulates from small, incremental advances due to the work of
multitudes of scientists and, exceptionally, from major ideas
that revolutionize the ﬁeld or create new ﬁelds from scratch
(Mokyr, 1990). Phases of slow evolution and apparent stagnation alternate with phases of rapid evolution marked by major
discoveries. The current slow evolution of our ﬁeld is not exceptional. If we adopt a Schumpeterian view of creative destruction,
neither is it a priori shocking to see some ﬁelds disappear
as others emerge. Are we witnessing the gradual and natural disappearance of our ﬁeld in part or in its entirety? Will
there be new ﬁelds? Computational hydraulics has long had

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

the wind in its sails, and some have even predicted the end
of classic hydraulics. Although it holds promise, notably for
studying bedload transport (Colombini, 2014), computational
hydraulics cannot replace experimental and theoretical investigations (Hager & Boes, 2014). Will some new ﬁeld of scientiﬁc
endeavour sound the death knell of hydraulics?
According to American anthropologist David Graeber, the
post-World War Two years saw the rise of what he called
“bureaucratic capitalism”, which entirely reshaped the world
since the USA had no competitor. The rising power of bureaucratic approaches to research has been well documented in
America (Ginsberg, 2011; Stephan, 2012), and the trend is now
worldwide. Graeber (2015) argued that “the increasing interpenetration of government, university, and private ﬁrms has led all
parties to adopt language, sensibilities, and organizational forms
that originated in the corporate world. While this might have
helped somewhat in speeding up the creation of immediately
marketable products – as this is what corporate bureaucracies
are designed to do – in terms of fostering original research,
the results have been catastrophic. (··· ) [Universities] have now
become brands to be marketed to prospective students or contributors. Marketing and public relations thus come to engulf
every aspect of university life.” In addition to the explosion of
administrative staﬀ and paperwork, Graeber explains that there
has been a shift of emphasis from creativity to bureaucratic
projects and, as a result, a decline in the number of major new
ideas, inventions and discoveries. If academia was once a refuge
for brilliant, quirky personalities, it has now become the realm
of managers. Could Hans Albert Einstein (or his father, Albert)
be tenured today?
As excessive as Graeber’s view may seem at ﬁrst glance, it
is largely supported by evidence. If we focus on medical and
pharmaceutical research, despite the massive investments which
have taken place since the 1950s, research eﬃciency is now
declining inexorably. Scannel, Blanckley, Boldon, and Warrington (2012) calculated that the cost of drug development
doubled every nine years (a negative trend referred to as
Eroom’s law in a deliberate and sardonic backwards reference
to Moore’s law). Bowen and Casadevall (2015) conﬁrmed the
decline in eﬃciency in biomedical research since the 1960s,
but they also reported that since the mid-2000s, the number
of molecules approved annually by the US Food and Drug
Administration has also decreased. This decline contrasts with
the constant ﬂux of press releases announcing breakthroughs
in biomedical research, but it may also explain the explosion
of cases of misconduct and the crisis of reproducibility in the
medical sciences (Baker, 2016). Whereas in the 1980s, Peter
and Olson (1983) were still wondering whether science was just
marketing (and, indirectly, whether Kuhn’s paradigm of scientiﬁc revolution still made sense), nobody even asks the question
nowadays. Kuchner (2011) showed scientists how to sell their
work more eﬀectively, writing “scientists are always trying to
be the ﬁrst to do something. But of course, it doesn’t always
work out that way. (··· ) To remedy this problem you need to

Bedload transport

27

ﬁnd or invent a new category you can be ﬁrst in. For example,
maybe your planet is the ﬁrst planet discovered by the transit
technique.” Lemaitre (2016) gave many speciﬁc examples of
how prominent scientists had built their reputation like fashion
designers. Another consequence of bureaucratic drift has been
the implementation of metrics and evaluation (Muller, 2018).
Stephan (2012) argued that “[the traditional] approach fails to
meet the criterion of accountability. In recent years, this has
proven to be the Achilles’ heel of such a system, as the public, especially in Europe where the system had ﬂourished, has
demanded to know what they are getting for their investment in
research – in terms of both the quality of the research and its
contribution to economic development. Like it or not, a number
of countries in Europe (··· ) have moved away from using unrestricted funds in supporting research to a system that allocates
university resources on the basis of past performance or through
peer review.”
Is the study of bedload transport a ﬁeld of research in decline?
Let us examine a common, simple metric – the annual number
of papers and books on bedload transport. Figure 4 shows some
bibliometric data extracted from Web of Science and Google.
The number of books and articles has steadily increased since
the 1970s. The average annual growth rate in bedload transport articles over the last 50 years has been 11.3%, higher than
the mean rate for all scientiﬁc papers, which ranges from 4%
to 9% (Bornmann & Mutz, 2015; Pan, Petersen, Pammolli, &
Fortunato, 2018). Because articles on hydraulics have followed
a similar trend, the percentage of bedload transport articles
within hydraulics has remained roughly constant (around 25%
if we use the criteria of Fig. 4). From this quantitative perspective, scientiﬁc production is by no means waning. Quantity is
admittedly not quality, but at least there is no evident sign of a
decline in the former.
What of bedload transport’s societal and scientiﬁc impact?
If we consider the total costs incurred by national and local
authorities in large river engineering and restoration projects
(e.g. the third correction of the Rhone, in Switzerland, whose
cost will exceed EUR 2 billion) or in risk analysis (e.g. whether
the Vouglans reservoir would damage the Bugey nuclear plant
in case of dam break), then it is essential to take bedload transport and its morphodynamic eﬀects into account. Poor scientiﬁc
analysis of the part played by bedload transport can have costly
and enduring consequences. For instance, two additional correction campaigns have been necessary (1930–1960 and 2000–
2020) to mitigate the eﬀects of bed aggradation in the Rhone
following the initial campaign from 1863–1894.
Thus, bedload transport remains something of a stubborn
paradox of hydraulics. The above considerations on scientiﬁc
output and real-world eﬀects show that the study of bedload
transport remains a living scientiﬁc ﬁeld with the potential to
inﬂuence a wide range of river engineering projects of huge
economic importance. Despite this, it suﬀers from a poor image
among university decision-makers, who perceive it to be an oldfashioned discipline. This image probably stems from the mode

is mainly funded by national science agencies. Furthermore,
the economic added value of high-performance, innovative
research is indirect: it takes years until the eﬃciency of sediment
management can be evaluated.

Education

Many readers will certainly agree that “river engineering is an
art as well as a science, and that modelling should therefore take

into account two distinct elements: theoretical fluid mechanics and a multitude of practical issues”, as Knight (2013)
claimed. By “art”, one usually emphasizes that hydraulics does
not rely solely on explicit knowledge – that is, a collection
of equations, rules and diagrams – but also on the implicit
knowledge gained through personal experience and interaction
with highly practised peers. The art of engineering is a delicate one, which involves “doing the best expert job possible in
an uncertain world” (Collins & Pinch, 2002) by mixing various forms of knowledge. Because bedload transport lies at the

Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 58, No. 1 (2020)

border between geomorphology and hydraulics, the part played
by empirical knowledge – gained by looking at how real-world
rivers work – is essential to training engineers and scientists.
A few decades ago, students of bedload transport were
faced with a complex scientiﬁc ﬁeld mixing equations, rules
of thumb, observations and empiricism. As summarized by
Ramette (1979), “students will be left hungry, they will likely
close the treatise, and conclude that this science has no connection with the essential notions of hydraulics that the school
has taught them. This science is full of caveats on the validity
domain of this or that correlation, and overall is an experimental ﬁeld that even experienced professionals can only use
cautiously.” And then these students will probably keep their
distance from a ﬁeld about which they have no understanding
– a wise decision. In the digital age, experience and implicit
knowledge are unable to compete with computers. Students and
junior engineers take the predictions of numerical code at face
value. Numerical codes are now standard tools in ﬂood-hazard
zoning and restoration projects, but few people seem aware that
their results are fraught with inaccuracies (exceeding one order
of magnitude, in many cases, with regards to bedload transport).
Better communication about the limits of current models is thus
paramount to avoid overconﬁdence in numerical models. Students need a better introduction to the strengths and weaknesses
of computational thinking.
Over the last four decades, higher education has experienced
major changes, including a substantial increase in the number of
students (resulting in mass education) and the development of
digital technologies and computational techniques (opening up
new possibilities). This is not without its challenges and threats,
such as the transformation of students into clients of academic
services, rising doubts about students’ levels of knowledge
and the development of self-inﬂated egos (Nichols, 2017). For
hydraulic engineers, there are two major concerns. The ﬁrst is
related to the misuse of computational tools, a point evoked
above, discussed by Cunge (2014) and that I will not belabour:
“the situation is catastrophic because apparently the students,
as well as prospective employers, do not realize that essential is understanding of physics and of limitations of modelling
software (Mouse, Mike, HEC, etc.) as well as facilitating software (ArcView, AutoCAD, etc.), not the skills of running these
software packages.” The second is related to statistical innumeracy (the greatest irony for engineers) – a form of mathematical
illiteracy in the handling of statistical concepts. Many engineering projects involve making decisions in an uncertain, risky
world, and the optimal decision is the one that not only satisﬁes
technical requirements but also draws inference from uncertain
data and knowledge. The German psychologist, Gerd Gigerenzer, was alarmed by how physicians made erroneous diagnoses.
He concluded that, “At present, high school education in some
countries covers only little, if any, statistical thinking. Algebra,
geometry, and calculus teach thinking in a world of certainty –
not in the real world, which is uncertain. Medical schools routinely teach statistics but focus on methods such as signiﬁcance

tests rather than the kind of statistical thinking needed for sound
diagnosis and risk assessment. As the widespread innumeracy in
the medical profession reveals, data analysis is typically taught
as a set of statistical rituals rather than a set of methods for statistical thinking” (Gigerenzer, 2003). Engineering schools are
not immune to innumeracy either (and, in fact, this threat looms
large over them). Reinforcing students’ statistical thinking and
teaching them how to reason on the basis of uncertain evidence
(e.g. using Bayesian analysis) is of paramount importance.
6 Concluding remarks
This paper started with the observation that scientists and engineers are unable to predict bedload transport rates in rivers to
better than one order of magnitude. This held true 70 years ago
when Meyer-Peter and Müller published their bedload equation,
and it has not changed to any signiﬁcant degree since then.
Existing methods fail to provide accurate estimates of bedload
transport rates Qs because of their large temporal and spatial variability. The Qs ﬂuctuations have long been regarded as
“simple” noise created by the numerous processes involved in
bedload transport (e.g. water turbulence, varying sediment supply and grain sorting) – noise that can be averaged out and thus
left largely unaddressed. There is growing evidence, however,
that Qs ﬂuctuations do not ﬂatten out when one removes the
sources of that noise, and thus they appear to be intrinsic features
of bedload transport. As with turbulence modelling, improving
our predictive capacities for bedload transport will require a better understanding of how ﬂuctuations are created and how they
aﬀect its bulk dynamics.

The issue of free will is a complex one that has occupied the minds of many theologians
and philosophers through the ages. The two main aspects of free will are the freedom to do
otherwise and the power of self-determination. This means that an agent must be able to
choose from alternative possibilities and that he or she must be the author or source of that
choice. Defined as such, it is clear that the issue of free will is undeniably closely linked with
the concept of moral responsibility. However, if we live in a deterministic world, where
everything is governed by the laws of nature, including our thoughts and behaviour, does
this leave room for free will and moral responsibility? As Dutch neurobiologist and author
Dick Swaab argues, the answer is an emphatic ‘no’. In this article, we will look at Swaab’s
case against free will. We will also see what modern neuroscience has to say about this hot
topic and whether it supports or discredits Swaab’s views. And finally, we will touch on
what this all means for moral responsibility.

Introduction
Many theologians and philosophers through the centuries have been grappling with the complex
issue of free will. In theology, these included Augustin, Luther, Edwards, Anselmus, Lipsius and Luis
de Molina, amongst others. Almost all the famous philosophers have reflected on this issue: Descartes,
Voltaire, Hume, Leibniz, Kant, Sartre, Daniel Dennett, Harry Frankfurt and others (Meuleman & Van
Vlastuin 2014:1). According to Dutch theologians Meuleman and Van Vlastuin (2014), it is:
[S]triking that [Robert] Kane in his Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Kane 2011) does not give a definition of the
concept of free will. This indicates the complexity of the issue. The complexity of free will is illustrated by the
interrelatedness of free will with issues such as responsibility, morality, consciousness, mind-body relationship
and psychiatry (Kane 2011). Instead of giving a single definition of free will, Kane (1999; 2007), König (1996),
Campbell (2011) and Mawson (2011) give several perspectives on free will when dealing with this issue. (p. 1)

Although this is a very complex issue and not easy to formulate a ‘concrete, all-encompassing
vision of free will’ (Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014:1), we should not shy away from it. There is
currently a renewed interest in free will not only by philosophers and theologians but also from
neuroscientists, experts from other disciplines and the media. This interest probably has to do
with our human beings’ anxious search for answers to the essence and meaning of life and our
existence (Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014):
[T]he fact that [Dick] Swaab’s book [Wij zijn ons brein. Van baarmoeder tot alzheimer] has enjoyed its 14
reprints in the Netherlands and that it featured continuously in the best sellers list for over two years is a
symptom of the great interest society has for the issues which are at stake in this area of research. (pp. 1–2)

According to Meuleman and Van Vlastuin (2014:2), ‘neurobiological concerns’ – which will be
the focus of our article – ‘touch upon important questions about responsibility, accountability,
morality and autonomy’. They reason that ‘at its core, the issue of free will has to do with the
real identity of the human being’ (Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014:2). With this in mind the
following important question comes to the fore: do people really have a free will because they
can choose? We, however, do not think that free will is determined by the fact that we make

choices, because all organisms continually make choices. It
is rather about whether the choice is completely free (or not).
So, the question arises: can people by any means make
decisions without internal or external constraints
determining that choice?
According to Swaab (2018:333), the well-known Dutch
neurobiologist, as stated in his above-mentioned book,1
Darwin said as far back as 1838 that the existence of free will
in human beings is an illusion, because human beings rarely
analyse their motives, and their actions are mostly instinctive.
Swaab argues that in our discussions of free will, three things
are usually referred to. In the first place, an action is free if
there are alternative possibilities – in other words, if you have
the choice not to do something specific. In the second place, it
must be done with a reason. A third characteristic of free will
is that you have the idea that you are doing the act out of
yourself (Swaab 2018:333–334), but actually it is only an idea.
This is in accordance with the Stanford Encyclopaedia of
Philosophy (2013:n.p.) that mentions the most common
features of free will as the freedom to do otherwise and
self-determinism. These aspects are combined to define
free will as ‘a philosophical term of art for a particular
sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course
of action from amongst various alternatives …’ (Standard
Encyclopaedia of Philosophy 2013:n.p.). It is clear to see that
the concept of free will is intricately connected with the
concept of moral responsibility. The core of this connection
revolves around the inclination to only attribute praise or
blame to agents if they themselves are the authors of their
actions. Some philosophers even use the control necessary for
moral responsibility in their definition of free will (Fischer
1994:3; Mele 2006:17; Wolf 1990:3–4). However, according to
the Dutch philosopher Spinoza (1632–1677), there is no
such thing as free will. He argues against this doctrine (Archie
2006):
[A]s a result of demonstrating that the activity of our minds is
equivalent to the activity of our bodies. The mind is more or less
active (or contemplative) in accordance with the body’s activity
or sensing. (n.p.)

Alexander Bain (1868), a Scottish philosopher, said that:
[S]pinoza denied free-will, because it was inconsistent with the
nature of God, and with the laws to which human actions are
subject … There is nothing really contingent. Contingency, free
determination, disorder, chance, lie only in our ignorance. The
supposed consciousness of freedom arises from a forgetfulness of
the causes that dispose us to will and desire. Volitions are the
varing [sic] appetites of the soul. (p. 414)

Swaab then refers to the following questions asked by Spinoza
(in his Ethica III) to illustrate that absolute free will does not
exist. Does a baby freely decide what he wants to drink? Does
a bad person freely decide to take revenge? Does a coward
decide he wants to flee? Does a chatterer decide that he wants
to say something whilst he actually can’t restrain his
talkativeness? In this way Spinoza tried to make it clear that

tot Alzheimer.

such traits are fixed forever. You can’t do anything to change
that (Swaab 2018:334). According to Swaab, neurobiology
shows us that there is currently no absolute freedom and that
our behaviour is determined from birth. He interestingly
links his research with theology by referring to Calvinism to
clarify his own determinism. He calls it ‘neurocalvinism’.
Neurocalvinism in this sense alludes to predestination, the
strict Protestant belief that the course of every person’s life is
predetermined by God. Meuleman and Van Vlastuin (2014:1)
had written an interesting article in this regard, examining
whether the two kinds of determinism, as seen by certain
neuroscientists and traditional Calvinism, are compatible.
They then argued ‘that this is not the case and that the
neurosciences propagate a stronger kind of determinism than
Calvin and that the two therefore are different in principle’
(Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014:1). Swaab (2018:334) reasoned
that numerous hereditary factors and environmental
influences during our early development have established the
structure and function of the brain for the rest of our lives.
Dawie van den Heever (2019:65) strikingly said in this regard
in his article entitled ‘The neuroscience of morality’: ‘[w]e are
complex machines made by nature and shaped by our
environment’. The result is that we not only have all kinds of
talents, skills and possibilities but also many limitations. For
example, one cannot suddenly decide that from now on you
are going to apply a certain talent whilst you know you do not
have it. We also have little influence on our moral choices, so it
seems. We approve or reject things, not because we necessarily
have thought so deeply about them, but because we cannot do
otherwise. Swaab (2018:335) reasoned in this respect that
ethics is a result of our ancient social instincts aimed at doing
what will not harm the group, as Darwin said long ago. As
adults, one can do little about modifying the brain and shaping
one’s behaviour. Our character has already been formed and
society largely dictates to us how to act. We are, therefore, not
only restricted from the ‘inside’, but also from the ‘outside’.
Van den Heever (2019) built on Croatian philosopher Boris
Kožnjak (2015:42) by saying that:
[E]verything in the universe is perfectly determined and obeys
the laws of nature. We do not know the positions of all particles,
but we do have a very good idea of the forces of nature. (p. 46)

He then continues his reasoning by stating that (Van den
Heever 2019; cf. Bode et al. 2014:637):
[A]ccording to determinism, these very same laws of nature that
we use to send rockets to outer space can also account for mental
processes and, thus, all voluntarily actions and decisions. Thus, no
thought or action can exist without a preceding cause. However,
according to Plato and Aristotle, the deterministic worldview
stood in conflict with concepts such as morality and responsibility
that require free will. (p. 46)

In this regard, it is important to refer to the three streams that
the understanding of free will is divided into. There are two
flavours of determinism. The first is called incompatibilism
or hard determinism.2 This view says that free will is
incompatible with determinism, and according to Meuleman
and Van Vlastuin (2014), it:

[P]ostulates that no one has a free will because everything is
already fixed. Choices have already been made by (in religious
determinism) God or (in natural determinism) by the causal
necessity of natural law. (p. 1)

The second flavour of determinism is compatibilism,3 which
says that free will is compatible with determinism that ‘free
will is true regardless [of] whether determinism is true or
not. Compatibilists believe that fully determined actions can
be seen as acts of free will’ (Meuleman & Van Vlastuin
2014:1).
And the third stream of understanding free will is the
(Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014):
[L]ibertarian view4 [that] does not defend that the will is free to
do what it wants but that the will is free to decide what it wants.
Libertarianism does not deny that man is influenced by his
environment, but this influence is not so strong that human
activity is merely a plaything. (p. 1)

Libertarian free will, therefore, typically denies determinism
and believes that some non-physical soul or mind can
override physical causality. The distinction between
compatibilists and libertarians is that the latter say ‘that free
will means that one is free to determine what one wants’,
whilst ‘compatibilists say that free will is the possibility that
one is free to [do] what one wants to do (or not)’ (Meuleman
& Van Vlastuin 2014:1). In other words, it is a ‘hypothetical
freedom’ (Meuleman & Van Vlastuin 2014:1).
On this track of thought, Imhof and Fangerau (2013) reasoned
that in the views of ‘hard determinism’ philosophers are
confronted with ‘the complete opposite position (so-called
“libertarianism”), which argue[s] for the possibility of
indeterminism and thus the capability to make free decisions’
(Kane 2005:40–52). Van den Heever (2019:47) explained that
‘[t]his philosophical view [libertarianism] says that a person
could have done otherwise under the same circumstances
and conditions if he or she “willed” to do so’. He then makes
clear that libertarianism, ‘given the same past, an agent must
have alternative possibilities available to him, and the origin
of his actions must lie within him’ (Bode et al. 2014:637; Imhof
& Fangerau 2013:203). The libertarian view of free will
naturally leads to some sort of dualism where one needs to
posit a substance or property other than physical matter that
can be the author of free choice such as a soul or a mind.
Having said this, what does modern science, and
more specifically neurobiology, tell us about the matter of
human free will?

The unconscious will
We make many decisions in a fraction of a second, or based
on our gut feeling, or intuition. Often, we make choices
without really thinking about it consciously. Our unconscious

brain makes crucial and complex decisions within seconds.
But this only happens after the brain has performed a huge
number of analyses. Swaab (2018:336) compared it with a
modern aircraft that can fly and land on autopilot without
interference from the pilot. In this way the brain also works
in a superb way unconsciously to a great extent. But for this,
the brain must be trained and the unconscious brain must
over a long period of time be fed intensively with information.
Functional scanning has shown that we use different
brain networks for conscious thinking and for making
intuitive decisions. To a large extent, the brain has to
work automatically and subconsciously because we are
bombarded with large amounts of information. Through
selective attention, we unknowingly extract from this
wealth of information what is important to us. Nobel
Laureate Daniel Kahneman (2011:20), in his international
bestselling book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, refers to two systems
in the mind, uncreatively called System 1 and System 2.
System 1 operates in the background, it has no sense of
voluntary control, but it is automatic, quick and requires
little or no effort. It is often associated with the unconscious
mind. System 2 on the other hand is slow, requires mental
effort and is often associated with consciousness, the
subjective experience of agency and choice (Kahneman
2011:20–21).
Conscious considerations (System 2) are certainly not always
better than unconscious decisions. It can even get in the way
of a good decision. Important financial decisions such as
buying a house, according to psychologist Ed de Haan (cited
in Swaab 2018:337), are sometimes made even better on the
basis of intuition, that is, without careful conscious
consideration (System 1). One can also grapple with a
problem for long periods of time without constantly and
consciously thinking about it, and then suddenly, whilst
doing something completely different, you get the solution.
So, our behaviour is, for the most part, so it seems, controlled
by unconscious processes. Factors from our cultural and
social backgrounds are also crucial when making unconscious
decisions. Physical factors such as temperature and light also
play a major role in our actions. During long summers as
reasoned by Swaab (2018:338), explosions of aggressive
behaviour can occur. The formidable decision to make war
has been decided upon during summer in the northern and
southern hemisphere for centuries. In this regard, Swaab
(2018:338) referred to Schreiber’s study of 2131 battles over
the past 3500 years. The amount of daylight or the temperature
seems to have been the deciding factor in this extremely
important decision when a war should begin. Obviously,
making all these unconscious decisions has its drawbacks as
well. Our unconscious racist and sexist views also often come
to light in unguarded moments. But the brain cannot help but
operate for the most part like a purposeful subconscious
automaton, which nevertheless makes rational decisions.
Unconscious, implicit associations allow us to make an
enormous number of complex decisions quickly and
effectively – something that would be impossible if careful
consideration of all the pros and cons was necessary. As can
Open Access

Page 4 of 8

be deduced from this, according to Swaab (2018:337–338),
there is no place for a conscious free will in all these
unconscious decisions.
Because our overworked brain is constantly making
decisions, Harvard psychologist Dan Wegner (as quoted by
Swaab 2018) speaks about an unconscious will instead of a
free will. The unconscious will makes quick decisions based
on what we experience in the environment. The way our
brain came into being during development, and what we
have learnt since, plays a crucial role in this. Because of the
complex, ever-changing environment in which we live, there
can be no proof that our lives are predetermined in any
predictable way, and because of the way our brain has
evolved, there can be no absolute free will. However, we
constantly feel that we (can) make free choices, and then we
call it free will. According to Wegner (quoted in Swaab 2018),
it is an illusion and it can be proven experimentally.
In 1983, scientist Benjamin Libet and his co-researchers
conducted an ingenious experiment to determine the
relationship between conscious intent and brain activity in
a simple movement task (Libet et al. 1983). Previously, in
1964, a pair of German researchers discovered the
Bereitschaftpotential, also known as the readiness potential
(RP; Kornhuber & Deecke 1965). The RP is a slow build-up of
cortical potential, measured with an electroencephalograph
(EEG), detectable moments before a self-initiated, voluntary
action. Libet et al. (1983) wanted to see where the conscious
intent to move would fit in relation to the action, and, more
importantly, in relation to the RP. A dualist libertarian view
of free will tells us that voluntary movements are caused by
conscious intentions and, therefore, the RP should be
preceded by the conscious intention to move. But the Libet
experiments showed the opposite, with the RP preceding the
conscious intention to move. This was measured by having
participants watch a specially designed clock face whilst
recording brain activity with EEG. The participants were
instructed to flex the wrist of their dominant hand whenever
they felt like doing it and to notice the position of the
revolving dot on the clock at the exact moment they became
aware of their intention to move. Their hand movement was
measured with an electromyogram (EMG), and it was found
that the conscious intention to move preceded the action by
200 milliseconds (ms). However, the onset of the RP preceded
the conscious intent to move by another 350 ms.
This seems to suggest that there is unconscious brain
activity that is responsible for spontaneous voluntary action.
Furthermore, it suggests that conscious awareness of the
action (often) only arrives after the initiation of the act. Many
similar studies have been conducted using different brain
imaging technologies, with all corroborating these findings
(Fried, Mukamel & Kreiman 2011:1; Lavazza 2016:3; Soon et
al. 2008). Many of these studies have been pushing the
cortical activity further back, widening the gap between the
brain activity indicative of movement and the conscious
intent. For instance, Fried et al. (2011), using an invasive
http://www.hts.org.za

Original Research

technique of implanting electrodes directly into the exposed
brain, witnessed the suggestive brain activity up to one and a
half seconds prior to the participants’ report of their conscious
intent to move. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and advanced statistical pattern recognition
techniques, Soon et al. (2008) could predict movement up to
7 s before participants were consciously aware of their intent
to move. In the Soon et al. (2008) study, the researchers also
included a choice, that is, the participants had the free choice
whether to move either their left hand or their right hand. As
we have seen this is an important feature when discussing
free will: the freedom to do otherwise, having alternative
possibilities. And still the authors were able to predict which
hand will move several seconds before the participants
‘freely’ chose to move. In a follow-up study by Soon et al.
(2013), the complexity of the task was increased, requiring
participants to either add or subtract two numbers per trial.
In this abstract decision-making task, the choice could be
decoded up to 4 s prior to the conscious moment the decision
was made as reported by the participants. This does not bode
well for the libertarian view of free will. A form of
determinism seems to reign.
In this regard, Susan Blackmore, a British psychologist and
writer, claims that consciousness is the story that is told
afterwards. She says, as quoted by philosopher Raymond
Tallis (2011):
[T]he human brain is a machine which alone accounts for all our
actions, our most private thoughts, our beliefs … All our actions
are products of the activity of our brain. (p. 52)

Dutch neuroscientist, Victor Lamme (2010:213), agreed and
said in this regard: ‘[o]ur activities do not follow our thoughts.
It is just the opposite’. According to Meuleman and Van
Vlastuin (2014):
[O]ther scientists such as Sternberg (2010) share this view. It
follows therefore that ethics are included in the condition of the
human brain. The task of the human brain during one’s life is
only to ensure that the body functions well and to give the brain
the opportunity to survive. A more deterministic vision of live
(sic) is almost impossible, and it includes the implication that
ethics disappear. (p. 5)

Rita Carter (2010), an Oxfordshire science writer, lecturer and
broadcaster, confirms this in her book Mapping the Mind by
referring to the importance of some of Libet’s findings:
[I]f, as it seems to show, the unconscious brain kicks off a
movement, and the conscious decision to make the movement
comes in its wake, the implication is that the brain itself is the
force that initiates the action. Rather than causing action,
consciousness merely reflects what the brain is already doing. If
this is true of all actions it follows that our behaviour is simply
the end product of automatic brain processes – and our notion of
a ‘free will’ is illusory. (p. 313)

Libet was not comfortable with the implications of his
own findings and the backseat spectator role it forced unto
consciousness. He desperately tried to save the notion of
free will and the authoritative role of consciousness in what
Open Access

Page 5 of 8

has become known as the ‘free won’t’ or veto concept. He
controversially suggested that the initiation of voluntary
action preceded unconsciously, but that a last-minute
(rather last few milliseconds) inhibition or veto of the action
can be carried out consciously (Libet 1999:47; Velmans
2002:11). He reasoned that in the 150 ms after conscious
awareness of the act to move, but before movement
(remember, movement happened 200 ms after
conscious awareness, and he left 50 ms for the neural
signal to travel from the brain to the site of action), a person
can consciously veto or cancel the action, thus restoring
free will (or free won’t). However, this raises the question, if
our decision to act develops unconsciously, why doesn’t
the decision to veto the act also have its own unconscious
precursors? And that is exactly what Filevich, Kühn and
Haggard (2013:e53053) showed in their aptly titled article,
‘There is no free won’t: Antecedent brain activity predicts
decisions to inhibit’. This squashed Libet’s attempt to save
even the slightest sliver of conscious free will and doomed
him, and all of us, to accept his findings.
However, even though these studies strip consciousness of
its despotic power and even though consciousness lags a
little behind reality, it remains useful. We make conscious
plans and consciously learn to drive a car and then execute it
automatically after much practice. The fact that many of our
actions come into being unknowingly does not preclude us
from acting consciously if we focus our attention on
something (Swaab 2018:338–340).

Free will and brain illness
Free will has been defined as the possibility of making a
decision without internal or external constraints determining
the choice. In addition, you must be able to recognise the
consequences of your actions in order to speak of an act
based on free will. In the case of a brain disease, there can be
both an internal limitation and an impossibility to judge
your own actions. It can have legal consequences. And thus,
we have to consider the issue of moral responsibility which,
as already mentioned, is tightly interwoven with the
concept of free will. If determinism is indeed true, should
anyone be held morally responsible for their actions? Swaab
(2018:343) referred to some enlightening examples: the
neatly dressed woman who suffers from Gilles de la
Tourette’s disease and suddenly starts using obscene
language in her neat clothes with her handbag on her lap
during a conversation with her doctor, surely doesn’t do it
out of free will? Can you hold a paedophile morally
responsible for his actions if you realise this behaviour
arises from a certain genetic background and atypical brain
development? Is paedophilia, so understood, a free choice?
How free is it when someone who, because of a combination
of his genetic background and his mother’s cigarette
smoking during her pregnancy with him, has attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and clashes with the
law? We know that malnutrition during pregnancy poses a
great(er) risk of antisocial behaviour. How free is such a
person when he or she, because of such behaviour, has to

Original Research

deal with the police? Can you blame a young person in
puberty, who still has to learn to cope with his or her brain
that has, because of sex hormones, started to function
completely differently, when he or she commits a crime?
We have learnt a great deal about the brain’s role in moral
decision-making and moral behaviour from brain lesion
studies. Brain lesions or brain damage to different brain
structures can have a whole host of different unwanted
effects and cause a range of impairments and inappropriate
behaviour. For example, paedophilia and other unprovoked
sexual behaviour can result from lesions, which impair
basic motivational mechanisms such as sexual drive (Moll
et al. 2005:800). Brain damage and degeneration because of
dementia to certain brain areas have been linked with
homosexual paedophilia, hypersexuality and aggressive
behaviour (Baird et al. 2007:1045; Moll et al. 2008:164).
Normal adults who suffer damage to certain cortical areas
can develop defects in decision-making and planning that
can lead to abnormal social conduct. The patients typically
have intact social knowledge, that is, they behave
inappropriately even though they can indicate which
behaviours are considered to be morally appropriate by
society (Cameron et al. 2018:261–262; Damasio, Tranel &
Damasio 1990:81). Brain imaging studies have also found
structural and functional abnormalities in several brain
areas in psychopathic individuals (Moll et al. 2005:800).
Another study showed that when damage to the frontal
parts of the brain occurs in infancy, it can lead to impairment
of the acquisition of moral rules and social conventions,
thus resulting in severely impaired social behaviour
(Anderson et al. 1999:1032). The normal developing brain
also presents its own moral dilemmas. Magnetic resonance
imaging studies have found that the brain during puberty is
structurally and functionally very susceptible to significant
increases in the natural sex hormones, such as oestrogen,
progesterone and testosterone. This can influence sex,
eating and sleeping habits (Arain et al. 2013:449–450).
The brain continues to develop, transform and change
during adolescence and continues up to about 24 years of
age. Given these natural occurring changes in the brain,
and the effects of brain lesions, dementia and other
environmental effects, the questions then become clear, ‘to
what extent must we hold such individuals morally
responsible for their behaviour and actions?’ Should they
be held responsible at all? Were their actions and behaviour
really self-determined? Were they the authors of their
actions? Do we ascribe free will to these agents?
The complexity of the concept of free will is also illustrated
by the rare ‘alien-hand’ syndrome that occurs when there is
no longer good communication between the two halves of
the brain. Swaab reasons this could be because of bleeding
that damaged the connection between the two brain halves,
the corpus callosum. Because of such damage, the activity in
one part of the brain can no longer be coordinated with the
activity in the other part of the brain. The ‘alien hand’ then
performs uncontrolled actions that can be completely

opposite to those of the healthy hand. For example, one hand
wants to put on the pants, whilst the other hand tries to pull
the pants off at the same time. Where is the free will for these
actions? An ‘alien hand’ patient tells how she woke up a few
times as her left hand tried to strangle her. This information
was used, as Swaab refers to, in the movie Dr Strangelove5 in
which Peter Sellers constantly tries to avoid with his one
hand the other hand from strangling him. When the above
patient was awake, her left hand attempted to loosen the
buttons of her dress, against the ‘will’ of her right hand. Her
left hand also fought with her right hand to pick up the
phone. The feeling that you no longer have control over your
own limbs, and the absence of the feeling that you initiate the
movement yourself, is frightening. It gives the patient the
illusion that someone or something else is initiating his or her
movements. The above-mentioned patient indeed felt that
she no longer had control of her own hand and thought she
was being controlled ‘from the moon’. So, it seems that if you
are aware of what is happening, but lack the feeling that you
have made that decision (free will), your body feels like a
foreign object.
This is further illustrated by Gazzaniga (2000) and colleagues’
studies on split-brain patients over the span of 40 years,
which have resulted in many insights into brain processes,
including perception, attention, memory, language,
reasoning abilities and even consciousness. In the 1960s and
the 1970s, a last resort treatment for severe epilepsy was a
procedure in which the corpus callosum was intentionally
severed, which gave the patients the tag of split-brain
patients. The seminal work on the split-brain patients
revealed that the left and right hemispheres of the brain
approach problems differently – almost as if they are two
distinct persons. In one famous example, a patient was shown
two pictures. One picture, that of a chicken claw, was shown
exclusively to the left hemisphere, and another picture, that
of a snow scene, was shown exclusively to the right
hemisphere. This was possible because visual information
presented to the left visual field projected exclusively to the
right hemisphere and visual information presented to the
right visual field presented exclusively to the left hemisphere.
The patient was presented with the two pictures and asked to
pick pictures that were associated with these pictures from
an array of pictures in view in front of him. The patient
responded by choosing a picture of a shovel with the left
hand (remember that the left hand is controlled by the right
hemisphere) and a picture of a chicken with his right hand
(controlled by the left hemisphere). These are the correct
associations. But when asked why he chose these specific
pictures, he replied (and remember that language is localised
to the left hemisphere), ‘Oh, that’s simple. The chicken claw
goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the
chicken shed’ (Gazzaniga 2000:1316). This shows that the left
hemisphere is unaware of what the right hemisphere has
seen and interprets the response in a context that is consistent

with the information available to it. These type of experiments
and results have moved researchers to refer to the left
hemisphere as the ‘interpreter’ (Gazzaniga 2000:1316). It
suggests that ‘[t]he left hemisphere possesses a unique
capacity to interpret behaviour and unconsciously driven
emotional states’ (Gazzaniga 2000:1316). The left hemisphere
will interpret the information available to it and confabulate
stories to make sense of the current context. Gazzaniga
highlights many differences between the two hemispheres
and the different functions they are responsible for. Relating
to our topic at hand, Gazzaniga says (2000):
[E]ven though each cerebral hemisphere has its own set of
capacities, with the left hemisphere specialized for language and
speech and major problem-solving capacities and the right
hemisphere specialized for tasks such as facial recognition and
attentional monitoring, we all have the subjective experience of
feeling totally integrated. Indeed, even though many of these
functions have an automatic quality to them and are carried out by
the brain prior to our conscious awareness of them, our subjective
belief and feeling is that we are in charge of our actions. These
phenomena appear to be related to our left hemisphere’s interpreter,
a device that allows us to construct theories about the relationship
between perceived events, actions and feelings. (p. 1293)

In the case of the ‘alien hand’ syndrome and the split-brain
patients, there seem to be two ‘wills’ in one brain, each
wanting to do something differently, but with the left
hemisphere the only one being able to communicate. So, the
understanding of free will also depends on good left and right
connections between the brain halves (Swaab 2018:343–344).
The idea that we are absolutely free to choose anything is not
only wrong but it has also caused many miseries in the words
of Swaab. In the past, it was generally accepted that our
sexual
orientation,
for
example,
heterosexuality,
homosexuality, bisexuality, intersexuality, etc., would also
be a matter of choice. And that is why a person has been
punished for homosexuality that was viewed wrong
according to most religions until recently. There are still
some countries that punish gay people who practically live
out their sexual orientation. In line with this kind of argument,
homosexuality was considered a disease by medical science.
Only in 1992, according to Swaab, homosexuality was
removed from the International Classification of Diseases.
Prior to that, vain attempts were made to cure homosexuals
of their suspected brain disease by imprisonment and by
horrific interventions, such as aversion therapy. And none of
that helped. In his review of Swaab’s book referred to
previously in this article, Cookson (2014) said that ‘sexual
orientation’ according to Swaab is ‘absolutely fixed in the
womb’ and that Swaab has:
[C]arried out considerable research on the biological origins of
homosexuality. Indeed his work played a significant part in
changing a scientific view, held widely until the 1980s, that
gender identity was determined largely by social influences
during childhood … Precisely what combinations of genes,
hormones and other chemicals induce future homosexuality,
bisexuality or heterosexuality in the embryonic brain – and how
they work – remains mysterious. (n.p.)

Cookson (2014) further stated that ‘whatever the causes’,
Swaab is:
[A]damant that events after birth do not effect sexual orientation.
Children brought up by lesbians are not more likely to be gay;
homosexuality should never be regarded as a ‘lifestyle choice’;
and attempts by some religious groups to ‘cure’ people of
homosexuality are doomed. (n.p.)

In brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis, it has been
repeatedly stated that the will to tackle the disease with a
positive mindset will promote healing. Not only is there no
evidence for this, but in addition, this view means that if the
illness takes a serious turn, the (poor) patient must hear that
he or she has not tried hard enough to overcome and beat the
disease (Swaab 2018:344–345). In light of this, Swaab is
curious to see how long it will take before other behavioural
patterns, such as aggressive and delinquent behaviour,
paedophilia, kleptomania and ‘stalking’, will be understood
and accepted not as a matter of free will but as innate.

Competing interests

Swaab (2018:345) insinuated that an absolute free will is an
illusion. This is not a new idea, for Benedict de Spinoza, as
already referred to, has stated in the Ethica (1677, statement
48): there is no unconditional or free will in the mind.
Determinism reigns supreme. But where does that leave us
with the question of moral responsibility? According to
Swaab (2018:345), if society can accept determinism, that
behaviours are innate, even the inappropriate and immoral
behaviours, that it would have far-reaching consequences
in how we must treat the offenders. We believe that
offenders should still be held morally responsible for their
actions and behaviours. The cause of these actions and
behaviours, in a deterministic sense, can be attributed to the
brain. We want to remind the readers of an earlier quote by
Meuleman and Van Vastuin (2014:2), and we will repeat it
here: ‘at its core, the issue of free will has to do with the real
identity of the human being’. And as Swaab so rightly
points out in the title of his book, we are our brains. Our real
identity is tied up in the complexity of our brains, in the
complex neural wirings inside our skulls. If our brain is the
cause of our behaviour, then we are the cause of our
behaviour and we should be held morally responsible.
However, the way we treat offenders must radically change.
We should not blame and seek punishment for offenders
out of a sense of revenge. Offenders should not be punished
for the sake of punishment. We must rather think of
treatment or rehabilitation. Blaming and punishing can
only be accepted if it will deter future harmful behaviour
and contribute to reforming the offender. If it can reliably
be shown that a person’s paedophilic tendencies are caused
by a brain tumour in his frontal lobes, and that removal of
the tumour will cure him of his immoral behaviour, should
he be punished or should the tumour be removed? Do we
still need to seek vengeance and punish such an individual
after the tumour has been removed and his behaviour
returns to normal and he is no longer a danger to society?
These are the types of questions we are inevitably confronted
with given the denial of free will.

Keywords: quantum physics, indeterminism, quantum superposition, special relativity, superluminal reference frames

Abstract
Dragan and Ekert (New J. Phys. 22 033038) have recently claimed that fundamental properties of
quantum physics (e.g. fundamental indeterminism and the principle of superposition) can be
derived solely from relativistic considerations, if one takes as physically meaningful superluminal
reference frames. In this comment we show that their arguments are flawed and their claims
therefore unwarranted.

1. Introduction
In a recent paper, Dragan and Ekert [1] advanced the hypothesis that some of the signature features of
quantum theory can be derived solely from special relativity, by considering a general derivation of the
Lorentz transformations which includes superluminal terms that are usually discarded on physical grounds.
In particular, their main claim, broadly construed, is that taking superluminal reference frames seriously
would lead to (a) fundamental indeterminism, (b) the superposition principle and—with a few more
mathematical assumptions—(c) the complex probability amplitudes, all key characteristics of quantum
physics.
As recalled in [1], the Galilean principle of relativity allows to derive the two following sets of relativistic
transformations (in 1+1 dimensions), both of which preserve the constancy of the speed of light c: the
standard Lorentz transformations
x′ = √

x − Vt
1 − V 2 /c2

t − Vx/c2
t′ = √
,
1 − V 2 /c2

(1)

which are well behaved for V < c, and a second class of transformations
x′ = ±

V
x − Vt
√
|V| V 2 /c2 − 1

t′ = ±

V t − Vx/c2
√
,
|V| V 2 /c2 − 1

(2)

that holds instead for velocities V > c. Dragan and Ekert’s work aims to investigate the physical consequences
of taking as physically meaningful superluminal reference frames and therefore the transformations given by
equation (2), allegedly showing that these lead to the aforementioned (quantum) properties.
However, in what follows we show that even if one is willing to give serious consideration to
faster-than-light reference frames (and we do not see anything wrong per se with exploring this possibility),
the arguments that purport to derive the above features from the principle of relativity—we will limit our

analysis to the first two points—are either untenable or require additional assumptions, which would be in
need of further independent justification. We therefore conclude that the claims made in [1] are
unwarranted.

2. The arguments and our counterarguments
2.1. Fundamental indeterminism
The first argument put forward in [1] is that of indeterminism. The authors consider a superluminal particle
(tachyon) being emitted at the spacetime point A and absorbed later at a spacelike separated point B, as
′
described within a given inertial reference frame O. In another reference frame O , related via a subluminal
velocity to O, the particle is described as being emitted at point B and absorbed at A. The two descriptions
are represented as spacetime diagrams in figure 1. Let us focus on the frame O and assume that the moment
of emission of the particle is fully determined by the properties of the events contained within its past
light-cone, i.e. that there exists a local and deterministic model of the particle emission. On the other hand,
′
switching to frame O , it seems that the emission of the particle at B is not determined by any events lying in
its corresponding past light-cone: the emission of the particle is thus ‘completely spontaneous and
fundamentally unpredictable’, thereby rendering a local and deterministic account impossible. The authors
finally claim that the only way to preserve the Galilean principle of relativity—and thus avoid introducing a
preferred reference frame—is to conclude that no ‘local and deterministic description of the emission of a
superluminal particle is possible in any inertial frame’ [1]. Moreover, since the transformations (2) allow to
turn a superluminal signal into a subluminal one and vice-versa—as seen by observers in a reference frame
that moves with relative superluminal velocity—the argument for fundamental indeterminism should apply
not only to tachyons but more generally: e.g. there can be no local and deterministic model of a subluminal
particle decaying into two subluminal particles, as pictured in figure 2.
The above argument can be reconstructed as the following entailment of conclusions C1 and C2 by
premises P1–P3:
P1: The Galilean principle of relativity implies that, if a local deterministic model of a physical process
cannot be given in one inertial reference frame, then it cannot be given in any other inertial reference frame.
P2: A physical process consisting in a superluminal particle being emitted and absorbed at two spacelike
separated events (as in figure 1) seems to allow a local deterministic model in reference frame O, but
′
definitely does not allow a local and deterministic model in reference frame O .
P3: Any particle can be regarded to travel superluminally relative to a class of inertial reference frames.
C1: By P1 and P2, the emission of superluminal particles does not allow a local deterministic model and
is thus fundamentally indeterministic.
C2: By C1 and P3, the decay of subluminal particles does not allow a local deterministic model and is
thus fundamentally indeterministic as well4 .
In what follows, we will show that the above argument contains several problems.
Remark. First of all, we want to remark that premise P1 requires further justification and specification. The
Galilean principle of relativity, as usually construed, states that the equations of motion need to retain the
same form in all inertial reference frames, and is thus not explicitly related to the (non)existence of local
deterministic models in various reference frames. The authors should thus state precisely what they mean by
‘the Galilean principle of relativity’ and provide a reason for why it is to be related to the (non)existence of
local deterministic models. While giving such a definition is surely viable, we think there might be problems
with justifying it due to the following reason. Notice that ‘local’ in ‘local deterministic’ refers explicitly to the
standard relativistic definition of locality: an event is explained locally and deterministically if its occurrence is
fully determined by the events lying in its past light-cone. However, we think that there is no physical reason to
give preference to events lying in the past light-cone to those lying outside of it, since we are considering both
subluminal and superluminal reference frames on the same footing. Thus, even though the notion of ‘local
determinism’ is surely well defined in this context, there is no reason for it to figure in the definition (or to be
a consequence) of the Galilean principle of relativity.
2.1.1. Counterargument 1
Furthermore, granted that one accepts P1, one ought to also accept the following premise: ‘If a local
deterministic model of a physical process can be given in one inertial reference frame, then it must be
possible to provide one in all other inertial reference frames.’ Denying the latter would imply an a priori

4 Notice that we added the qualifier seems in premise P2, as the argument would otherwise result in a logical contradiction, i.e. ‘there is a
local deterministic model within reference frame O, and there is no local deterministic model within the reference frame O’.

preference for non-local-deterministic models, whereas a principle of relativity (such as the Galilean one)
should only have a claim on relational features between different frames. One should thus replace P1 with:
‘Either all inertial reference frames allow local deterministic models, or none of them do’.
With the latter in mind, premise P2 turns out suspicious as well: at pains of avoiding a logical
contradiction, we needed to add that it merely seems that there is a local deterministic model in frame O, but
′
that it is definitely the case that there is none in frame O . However, one may turn the story around and claim
that it is definitely the case that there is a local deterministic model in frame O and that it merely seems as if
′
there was none in frame O . Again, there is no positive reason to accept the former rather than the latter. A
staunch proponent of local determinism may indeed argue analogously to the authors that, since per
assumption there exists a local deterministic model in frame O, the Galilean principle of relativity guarantees
′
that there is one in frame O as well (despite the deceiving appearance that there is none, i.e. it may be a
model of hidden variables). Such an argument would again be erroneous, unless its proponent provided an
explicit local deterministic model in reference frame O. All in all, conclusions C1 and C2 are not warranted
due to P1 being incomplete (it prefers non-local-deterministic models) and P2 being unjustified (the
′
non-existence of a local deterministic model in frame O is not argued for).
2.1.2. Counterargument 2
Even if one were to ignore the above problems and to fully accept the reasoning provided by the authors, the
argument leads to untenable consequences. The authors have clearly intended for the argument to apply only
to microscopic phenomena (e.g. particle decays); however, the Galilean principle of relativity, as standardly
construed, can be applied to macroscopic bodies as well. Indeed, there is no positive reason to prevent one
from considering the diagrams in figures 1 and 2 as representations of macroscopic bodies (e.g. billiard balls,
human beings or galaxies) moving and colliding in spacetime. For example, instead of a particle decay,
figure 2 may represent a rock containing a dynamite set to explode exactly 1 min after being prepared,
thereby splitting the rock into two parts: the authors’ argument would lead one to conclude that the
detonation of the rock was fundamentally indeterministic. However, that is obviously not the case, as not
3

New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 128001

F Del Santo and S Horvat

only that physicists can provide faithful local and deterministic models of the dynamite, but engineers can
even use these models to construct the dynamite itself. The point is that the conclusions provided by the
authors are intended to apply exclusively to those phenomena that are adequately modelled by quantum
theory; however, this domain does not coincide with the domain of phenomena to which the Galilean
principle of relativity is applicable. This exhibits a fundamental deficiency in any attempt of deriving features
of quantum theory exclusively from relativistic principles.
2.1.3. Counterargument 3
The authors argue for fundamental indeterminism by attempting to display an inconsistency between local
determinism and Galilean relativity (when extended to superluminal reference frames). However, the
argument can be reiterated by replacing ‘local deterministic models’ with ‘local probabilistic models’ (or
simply ‘local models’), provided that one accepts the following modification of premise P1: ‘Either all inertial
reference frames allow local probabilistic models, or none of them do’. Indeed, there is no reason to accept
the relation between local deterministic models and Galilean relativity without also accepting the relation
between the latter and local probabilistic models5 . According to the authors, from the perspective of
′
reference frame O , ‘the past world-line of the particle B carries no information about the time of the event
B’, implying that ‘the emission at B was completely spontaneous and fundamentally unpredictable’ [1]. This
′
would then imply that also within frame O , the emission at A must have been completely spontaneous and
fundamentally unpredictable. On the other hand, if one were able to provide a local probabilistic model in
one of the reference frames, then one would be able to fix the probability distribution of the emission event,
based on the events lying in its past light-cone, and this distribution may as well sometimes be peaked
around a certain value (indeed, recall that, mathematically speaking, deterministic models can be regarded as
a subclass of probabilistic models, i.e. those that assign probabilities 0 or 1 to all events). Therefore, the
argument put forward by the authors does not lead merely to the negation of local determinism, but to the
negation of any quantitative local explanation whatsoever (be it deterministic or probabilistic). The issue of
(in)determinism is thus irrelevant for this discussion: only locality (as standardly conceived in relativity) is at
stake when considering superluminal reference frames, which is not that surprising.
Incidentally, by putting forward their argument for indeterminism, the authors also seem to be trying to
give a more solid physical ground to their proposal of considering superluminal velocities. In fact, they
maintain that ‘if we had a source of superluminal particles at our disposal, we would not be able to use it to
send any information because we would not be able to control the emission rate using any local operations’
[1]. However, this claim appears to be justified only in the case that the indeterminacy of the source is indeed
maximal, i.e. when there is no possibility even in principle to have any information whatsoever on when or
even if there will be an emission. On the other hand, indeterministic theories that deserve any credit are
usually provided with some measure of likelihood. For instance, quantum mechanics, which is considered
the indeterministic theory par excellence6 , allows to compute the probability of events, such us the decay of a
radioactive nucleus (to whose emitted particles we grant here the possibility in principle to travel faster than
light), which can then be used to signal. It would suffice to agree between two parties that the time window
for detecting a signal is long enough to allow a decay with a probability close to certainty.
2.2. The superposition principle
The second main claim of Dragan and Ekert is that from the principle of relativity, one can retrieve another
property characteristic of quantum theory, namely ‘the fact that a particle that is not observed behaves as if it
was moving along multiple trajectories at once’ [1] (superposition principle).
To support this, they propose the following simple arrangement. In the rest frame of an observer O,
consider a physical object that travels at the speed of light from a source (event A), bounces on a mirror M
and is reflected back to the original position (event B). This object has a well-defined single trajectory, as
shown in the spacetime diagram in figure 3. Dragan and Ekert proceed by noticing that for an infinite
velocity, the transformations (2) reduce to
x ′ = ct
ct ′ = x.

(3)

′

Thus an observer O moving at infinite speed with respect to the reference frame of O, will see the time and
the space axes swapped. In this new frame, the same set-up will look as if the object originated at M and
5 As explained in the previous counterarguments, we would deny both connections.
6 There are, however, further proposals of fundamentally indeterministic theories, including the alternative indeterministic interpretations

of classical physics [2, 3] and of special relativity [4], proposed by one of us.

‘followed two trajectories’ towards the (now spatially separate) locations A and B. The authors then state: ‘If a
detector placed at the path A–M absorbs the photon ( = the object in question), then a similar detector
placed at the path M–B will not register anything, because the photon has been absorbed earlier. Similarly, if
a detector at M–B absorbed the photon, then certainly, the photon could not have been detected at the path
′
A–M’ [1]. Therefore, despite associating two paths M–A and M–B to the object in question, observer O still
regards the process to involve a single object (or particle), since, if she were to introduce two absorbing
detectors in the set-up, then only one of them would click (i.e. register the object), thereby resembling a
quantum particle in spatial superposition. From the latter they conclude that ‘even if we start with an idea of
a classical particle moving along a single path, it is only a matter of a change of the reference frame to arrive
at a scenario involving more than one path’ [1].
The argument may be formulated as follows:
P1: While a classical object (e.g. particle) may follow a well defined spacetime trajectory in one reference
frame, there exist other inertial frames, namely those related to the first one via superluminal velocities,
relative to which multiple trajectories are associated to the same object.
P2: When one places absorbing detectors along the path of the object, one observes anti-correlations
between the detection events.
C: Therefore, a classical object moving along a single trajectory in one reference frame can behave as a
quantum particle in spatial superposition in another reference frame.
We think that this argument is flawed due to the following reasons.
2.2.1. Counterargument 1
Let us start with a criticism of P2 and its relation to C. Namely, the authors invoke explicitly only absorbing
detectors, i.e. those that destroy the object in question upon detecting it. The reason they do so is to introduce
an anti-correlation between the detection events. This is however a very stringent assumption, as there are
surely detectors that do not destroy their pertaining objects upon registering them. Therefore, the argument
seemingly applies exclusively to those objects which are necessarily destroyed upon measurement (i.e. those
objects for which a non-demolishing measurement does not exist). This is why the authors of [1], provide as
the only example that of a photon, which arguably is always destroyed upon measurement. This, however,
jeopardises the strength of their argument, for a photon is a genuinely quantum concept while the aim of the
authors is to retrieve a property of quantum physics starting only from classical relativistic considerations.
At any rate, even if the argument were to be applied to objects necessarily destroyed upon measurement
(like perhaps photons) only, one may simply construct a device that absorbs and re-emits the object in
question (or creates a new one). The argument thus does not hold even for photons, let alone for neutrons or
electrons, which are commonly modelled by quantum mechanics, and for which non-demolishing
measurements do exist.
2.2.2. Counterargument 2
There is a further fundamental problem. Consider a standard quantum particle (e.g. electron) prepared in an
equally weighted spatial superposition of ‘two paths’, and two demolishing detectors placed at the end of
their corresponding paths. Elementary quantum mechanics and experimental practice tell us that each
detector registers the particle with probability 12 , and that if one detector clicks, the other does not. Now
consider again the scenario proposed by Dragan and Ekert in figure 3, and suppose that one places one
detector in the middle of path A–M and another in path M–B. It trivially follows from the left picture that
the detector placed in A–M will click with probability 1, and the second detector will never click (because the
5

New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 128001

F Del Santo and S Horvat

particle is absorbed at the previous detector). In the superluminal reference frame, the following thus holds:
(a) if both detectors are present, only the one in path M–A clicks; (b) if only one detector is present, then it
clicks with probability 1. Therefore, the set-up considered by the authors does not replicate at the empirical
level the behaviour of a quantum particle in spatial superposition.
2.2.3. Counterargument 3
The authors’ argument relies on the fact that a single trajectory is mapped into two trajectories via a
superluminal reference frame transformation. There are two problems with the latter reasoning.
Firstly, the diagram in figure 3(b) does not need to be interpreted as representing two trajectories M–A
and M–B; one may alternatively understand it as still representing a single trajectory that consists of the
particle travelling backwards in time from A to M, and then forwards in time from M to B. A proponent for
the latter interpretation may even provide positive reasons for such a view: (a) it preserves the causal order
between the events, as the particle travels from A towards B with an intermediate bounce at M in all reference
frames, and (b) M still behaves as a mirror in all reference frames. On the other hand, concerning point (b),
Dragan and Ekert’s view arguably implies that we can turn a mirror into a particle source (or into a
beam-splitter) merely by changing our reference frame, which, while not logically inconsistent, leaves one
wanting for further explanation. Anyhow, our aim is not to endorse the above alternative interpretation, but
just to emphasize that more interpretations are possible and that the authors ought to argue why their view is
the most preferable one (without invoking any quantum mechanical principles, as that would just beg the
question).
The second problem is far more serious: there is a whole class of quantum superposition phenomena that
cannot be captured by a mere change of reference frame. For example, consider a standard Mach–Zehnder
experiment that consists in a particle travelling in a ‘superposition of two paths’, both of which meet at the
same spacetime location (at a beamsplitter), thereby closing a spacetime loop. In order to see that such an
experiment cannot be accounted for by the authors’ argument, it is enough to notice that a reference frame
transformation (be it subluminal or superluminal) cannot turn an open trajectory into a closed one. The
same holds for any other phenomenon involving loops. In the paper, the authors actually mention that such
trajectories can be obtained, but do not provide any detailed explanation for it. A further problem is that a
single trajectory traced by a classical particle can be transformed only to those trajectories which can be
bijectively mapped into a real interval (e.g. the interval [0, 1]). Therefore, one could not even account for a
particle entering into a beamsplitter and ‘splitting into two paths’, which would trace a trajectory in the shape
of the letter ‘Y’. This is also the reason that mirror M in figure 3(b) spontaneously produces a particle,
without any object entering into it from the past.
2.2.4. Counterargument 4
A generic comment analogous to Counterargument 2 from the previous section can be made here as well.
The authors intend to use special relativity to infer that microscopic objects follow the quantum
superposition principle; however, relativistic arguments may be applied to a much wider domain of objects.
For instance, one may take figure 3(a) to represent a billiard ball bouncing from the edge of a billiard table,
which would be described within a superluminal reference frame as the billiard ball ‘travelling in
superposition’; however, billiard balls manifestly travel through definite trajectories. One may arguably
model even a billiard ball as a quantum mechanical system; however, the ball would then be represented as
interacting with the table on which it is rolling and with the remaining environment, which would induce
decoherence and highly suppress non-classical effects.

3. Conclusion
In this comment, we have shown that Dragan and Ekert’s claims in [1] are unwarranted. We have provided
detailed counterarguments against their allegation that certain quantum features—fundamental
indeterminism and the principle of superposition—can be derived only by invoking the Galilean principle of
relativity and taking seriously the superluminal class of relativistic transformations that follow from the
latter. We did not deem necessary to discuss here the further claim in [1], according to which, the complex
probability amplitudes which characterize quantum mechanics can be inferred solely from relativistic
considerations, because this is quite logically independent from the line of thought commented in the
previous sections, and does not rely on the generalised transformations (2).
In conclusion, while it is surely desirable to try to derive the peculiar features of quantum theory from
some fundamental principles, it does not seem that the principles of special relativity alone are sufficient for
this programme.

The CMT Model of Free Will

LOUIS VERVOORT and TOMASZ BLUSIEWICZ

University of Tyumen, Russian
Federation

ABSTRACT: We propose a compatibilist theory of free will in the tradition of naturalized
philosophy that attempts to: 1) provide a synthesis of a variety of well-known theories,
capable of addressing problems of the latter; 2) account for the fact that free will
comes in degrees; and 3) interface with neurobiology. We argue that free will comes
in degrees, and that these degrees vary with the agent’s capacity to make assumptions
and use theories. Our model, then, highlights that free-willed actions are consciously
monitored by the agent, through beliefs, assumptions, and ultimately theories —
hence, the CMT model (for Conscious-through-Monitoring-through-Theories).
RÉSUMÉ : Nous proposons une théorie compatibiliste du libre arbitre, dans la tradition
de la philosophie naturalisée, qui tente : 1) de fournir une synthèse de théories bien connues, capable de résoudre certains problèmes de ces dernières; 2) de tenir compte du fait
que le libre arbitre a des degrés; 3) d’établir des liens avec la neurobiologie. Nous
arguons que le libre arbitre d’un agent varie par degrés en fonction de la capacité de
l’agent à faire des hypothèses et à utiliser des théories. Notre modèle met en évidence
que des actions «libres» sont consciemment surveillées par l’agent, à travers des croyances, des hypothèses et ﬁnalement des théories — d’où l’expression «modèle CMT» (pour
Conscious-through-Monitoring-through-Theories).

1. Introduction: Approach Used
The question of whether humans have free will is an all-time classic in philosophy; a staggering number of ‘great minds’ from all disciplines have expressed
their opinions on it. Two typical positions in the debate are hard determinism

and libertarianism.1 Hard determinists reject free will on the hypothesis that all
events, including our choices, are predetermined (ﬁxed) by the laws of nature
and the past; libertarians accept free will as a given and reject determinism.
According to typical hard determinists, free will would largely be an illusion,
fuelled by our obvious feeling of being free, and entertained by our obvious
incapacity to process all factors inﬂuencing us (and thus by our incapacity to
predict in detail what will happen to us). However, many professional
philosophers — perhaps even the majority2 — are compatibilists; according
to compatibilism, determinism and free will are not in contradiction.
The model we elaborate here is compatibilist. We have presented arguments
in favour of determinism elsewhere,3 but our compatibilist view will actually
appear to be independent of whether our universe is deterministic or indeterministic; hence, our model might also appeal to proponents of indeterminism. Our
theory is based on an advanced biophilosophical account of consciousness
developed by Martin Mahner and Mario Bunge.4 We adhere in the following
to a naturalized philosophy, sympathetic to interaction with natural sciences.5
Thus, in the conclusion, we will brieﬂy sketch how our model could be instrumental for some scientiﬁc disciplines, in particular neurobiology and computer
science.
One goal is to construct a ‘minimal’ model in the sense that we aim to identify
the minimal set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to term an act ‘freewilled’ or ‘free.’ In this endeavour, we use classic tools of analytic philosophy.
However, we may be less typical in our attempt to synthesize prominent theories
of free will. With synthesis, we mean the attempt (or its result) to show how different established and efﬁcient theories can be derived from one and the same
uniﬁed model, or, more realistically, how the essential ingredients of different
established models belong to one umbrella model. We believe that, in the free
will debate, millennia old, analytic philosophy has invested such enormous
efforts and has made, especially the last 50 to 60 years, such progress in conceptual clarity, that efforts at synthesis are now well justiﬁed. This is so on the condition, of course, that the resulting synthetic model can solve worries where
isolated accounts remain silent or powerless. Also, let us note that, in natural science, especially physics, synthesis — or ‘uniﬁcation’ as is it is termed there —
of different assumptions and theories is recognized as the key principle for
theory-building; we see no reason that this should not be the case in philosophy.

Thus, we insist that our model should be judged on its results, namely the fact
that it can tackle problems that have been identiﬁed in competing modern theories, as shown in Section 7. Each of the ingredients or components of our
model will appear necessary to address these problems.
Methodologically, our synthetic and ‘naturalized’ approach is inspired
by, and can be compared to, the work of philosopher and neuroscientist
Henrik Walter,6 who proposes a component theory of maximal libertarian
free will: a theory with essentially three requirements that a libertarian would
demand of a ‘free’ act — in short, alternativism, intelligibility, and agency.
Walter has done an extensive literature review to show that his component theory covers a wide spectrum of the most relevant modern theories and issues on
free will — hence, the relevance of benchmarking our model to Walter’s.7
Regarding the content of our model, our most conspicuous inﬂuences come
from A.J. Ayer,8 and, especially, Mahner and Bunge,9 as explained in Sections 4
and 5. These authors develop theories of which essential ideas can be traced
back to such forerunners of the philosophy of free will as Aristotle and
Aquinas. In Section 6, we will show in detail how these models can be combined
into our favourite model, which we propose to term the ‘CMT model of free
will’ (for ‘Conscious-through-Monitoring-through-Theories’).
We will argue that one advantage of this model is that it captures a feature of
free will that we believe is essential, namely that free will comes in degrees. The
variability of free will has been hinted to by neurobiologists,10 and convincingly
analyzed by philosophers11; we will present our own arguments in Section 3,
after explicitly stating our background assumptions in Section 2. Our model suggests, as far as we know for the ﬁrst time, a qualitative ‘measure’ for this variability of free will (Section 6). As said, we will also show that this model can be
related to, and synthetically explain salient properties of, very recent theories,
notably those of Harry Frankfurt, Susan Wolf, John Martin Fischer and Mark

Walter 2001.
Walter himself is not a libertarian; in his book, he tests the three ingredients of libertarian free will against natural science, in particular, neuroscience. He argues that
neuroscience does not really support alternativism (the hypothesis that ‘at the atomic
scale,’ i.e., taking all physical facts into account, a human brain has, at any given
time, real alternatives to choose between — cf. Walter 2001). So, Walter is not in
favour of strong libertarianism but shows that versions of intelligibility and agency
do ﬁnd support in neuroscience. We assume from the start, as compatibilists and
determinists, that alternativism is eliminated.

Ravizza, and Walter.12 Of course, we can here only make a succinct comparison
with these elaborated theories (Section 7).
2. Background Assumptions
Maybe it is useful to explicitly state our background assumptions. We assume
that our mental activity, our thoughts, choices, feelings, etc., have a neurological, and ultimately chemical-physical, basis in the brain: mental states correspond to neural (super)networks, mental acts are brain processes.13 Based on
the famous Libet experiment and other neuroscientiﬁc experiments (showing,
for instance, that ‘free’ choices can be predicted up to eight seconds before
the subject’s conscious action14), many, but certainly not all, neuroscientists
favour a deterministic interpretation in the free will debate. This is an argument
for us to look for a compatibilist model. In physics, the orthodox position is that
at the quantum level nature is probabilistic and therefore indeterministic. But a
detailed scrutiny shows that this assumption is heavily metaphysically tainted
and that the debate is undecided.15 Simply stated, physical determinism is the
assumption that given all physical data of the universe at any given moment
t0, and given the laws of nature, there is only one possible future after t0. In
other words, all events, including all mental events, are determined, caused,
ﬁxed by preceding events. Many determinists conclude from this that we do
not really have robust alternatives (alternativism is false) even if we feel that
we have. This would mean, in particular, that we do not have the ‘ultimate’
kind of free will that a typical libertarian assumes, the free will of a ‘mind’
that could make a real difference, and could make a genuine choice at t0, largely
independently of the events preceding t0. But some important form of free will
may still exist; which form is the object of study of this article.
3. A Preliminary Observation: Free Will Comes in Degrees
Technically speaking, our goal is to construct a deﬁnition of a ‘free-willed’ act
by a human, in the form of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions. Hence, we aim to
identify the conditions C1, C2, C3, … such that ‘person P does act A of his own
free will’ if and only if (IFF) C1, C2, C3, … are satisﬁed. The Ci are all necessary conditions and they are jointly sufﬁcient to imply free will. As stated, and
remembering Occam’s razor, we are looking for the minimal, most economic set
{C1, C2, C3, …}. Finally, we look for conditions that are compatible with determinism. They will also appear to be compatible with indeterminism;

compatibilist models can have this feature. Therefore, our deﬁnition would survive even if the universe were indeterministic.
But, we would also like our model to say something about a feature of free
will that seems important to us, namely its variability. Imagine your favourite
dog is playing in the garden, when suddenly you see your neighbour’s cat
appear. You shout: Aristotle, stay put! For a fraction of a second, Aristotle
remains motionless, throws a guilty glance at you, and then chases after the
cat. Has Aristotle got free will? Could Aristotle have done otherwise? Has he
alternatives? Maybe, but most philosophers agree that free will, and certainly
the free will needed for moral responsibility,16 is essentially a human thing (if
it exists at all). But, granted, one might say that Aristotle, the dog, possesses
an embryonic version of free will. Has a new-born child got free will? A
fetus? No, most would say. When, then, does a child start having free will? If
a normal adult has free will, and if free will is linked to brain activity — a
brain activity that grows continuously more complex when a fetus and new-born
child evolve into an adult — then it seems that one inevitably comes to the conclusion that free will comes in continuous degrees. This is, we believe, a rather
innocuous conclusion, that has been noted by Timothy O’Connor17 and with
which many philosophers could agree, we believe — especially in the naturalized philosophy tradition.18 Since this hypothesis will be highly instrumental in
the following, we term it the ‘degree-thesis.’ Simply put: free will comes in
degrees; in other words, the mental capacity of free will is something that admits
of (continuous) variations or gradations, something that a human (and generally
speaking an animal) can have to greater or lesser extent — moreover, an extent
that can vary with time within an agent, as noted by O’Connor.19 Another way to
understand this variability is to realize that animals have continuously evolved
from bacteria over invertebrates, ﬁsh, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals to
primitive human species to modern Homo sapiens, and that somewhere in
this evolution, parallelling a steady increase in brain complexity, free will
must have appeared, not suddenly, but evolving in the same continuous way

Note that this article is not about moral responsibility. We leave the link between free
will and moral responsibility unspeciﬁed; we minimally declare that we are interested in ‘high level free will,’ typically understood by philosophers as being required
for moral responsibility.
O’Connor 2009.
O’Connor (2009) arrives at the conclusion of variability of free will by an independent route, notably by observing that agents can be, to lesser or greater extent, consciously aware of the factors guiding their choices. As will be seen further, this — in
our view, highly relevant — observation can well be ﬁtted to our ﬁnal model, developed in Sections 6–7.

as the brain did. We will have much more to say on this in a moment. Indeed, we
suggest that there exists a concept that can ‘measure’ this continuous
progression.
4. A Basic Deﬁnition of Free Will (Ayer Model)
Let us now start our main task and look for the simplest non-trivial compatibilist
model of free will; this simplest model, however, cannot solve certain problems
and will have to be completed in a subsequent stage. A considerable part of the
academic debate on free will has turned on the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP).20 According to the PAP, a person P does act A of his own free will
only if P could have acted otherwise than doing A (this ‘only if’ condition is then
a necessary condition for free will). Most libertarians embrace the PAP as a
proof that free will excludes determinism. But it is well known that there are considerable problems with the characterization of free will provided by the PAP.
Notably, Frankfurt has provided counterexamples in which he presents cases
in which P could not have acted otherwise, while he still acts with free will;
hence, the PAP would be false.21 These arguments have been criticized in
turn22; a detailed overview of the most recent developments in this intense
debate has been provided by O’Connor and Christopher Franklin.23 We believe
that it is fair to say that this matter is undecided.
A classic compatibilist attempt to defuse the worries related to the PAP was
made in a well-known article by Ayer.24 The article famously argues that the
capacity to choose as invoked in the PAP may well be guaranteed by the simple
requirement that subject P acts without constraint. In its simplest expression, an
act of free will, for Ayer, is an act that is not under constraint — an idea that
traces back at least to Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics (Book III). In more detail,
we can extract the following analytic deﬁnition of free will from Ayer’s article.
‘P acts of his own free will’ is essentially equivalent to ‘P acts without constraint,’ more precisely:
DEF-A.‘P acts of his own free will’ IFF
i. P is not compelled by other persons;
ii. there is no habitual ascendancy over P by other persons; and
iii. P acts voluntarily.

Ayer leaves the concept of ‘voluntary act,’ again a notion that goes back to
Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, Book III), rather imprecise; therefore, we will
have to come back to it in a moment. But, from the text, it follows that at
least one ingredient of ‘voluntary’ is: not being under constraint of an abnormal
mental condition such as a mania, a neurosis, etc. Can an act that is not constrained and thus ‘free’ according to (i) — (iii) also be free in the sense of the
PAP; in other words, could the unconstrained P also ‘have done otherwise’?
Ayer famously answers in the afﬁrmative; he construes ‘P could have acted otherwise’ as follows: A) P was not constrained in the sense above (no one compelled P and the act was done in a ‘normal’ psychological condition), and B)
P would have acted otherwise if P had so chosen.
Sure, this construal is far from universally accepted,25 but what is essential for
us is that DEF-A can be supplemented in order to address worries of much more
sophisticated recent theories, as argued in Section 7. Therefore, we take DEF-A
as a minimal analytic starting point. (Even if this is not essential at this point, one
could then also adopt Ayer’s construal of ‘could …’ as ‘would … if …’ as plausible, also because it is compatible with determinism. Note that the same holds
for clause A): P can be unconstrained in the quite common sense (i) — (iii) even
if everything is determined. In Ayer’s words, free will should be contrasted with
constraint, not determinism.) For the time being, we retain: there are respectable
arguments that an act of free will can be characterized in terms of absence of
constraint in the sense (i) — (iii), with the proviso that we would like to
know more about what ‘voluntary’ means in (iii).
Still, it is clear for other reasons that DEF-A cannot be the whole story. We
can repeat an argument we already invoked above: ‘real free will’ should be
something more than just ‘unconstrained will that has the ability of choosing
between options,’ because it seems that even animals could have this type of
will — recall Aristotle the playful dog. But, like most philosophers, we ascribe
‘real’ free will only to humans.
What, then, is the feature that distinguishes humans most clearly from animals? There is a long philosophical tradition related to this question, but it is presumably uncontroversial to identify consciousness, the capacity to think, and
rationality as the key elements of distinction. Then, something of this should
enter the deﬁnition of free will. And, indeed, consciousness and/or rationality
seem implicit in Ayer’s concept of voluntariness, as an ingredient of free will,
as also follows from early analyses of the concept of voluntariness by
Aristotle and Aquinas.26 We therefore should ﬁnd a model for this essential
but admittedly somewhat vague concept.

5. Voluntariness and Consciousness (Mahner-Bunge Model)
To analyze voluntariness, the most developed naturalized model of which we are
aware is proposed in the already mentioned work by Mahner and Bunge (MB,
henceforth).27 In their Foundations of Biophilosophy the authors attempt a
penetrating and wide-ranging approach with the aim to provide an axiomatic
theory of key concepts of biology, including psychobiology. Their approach
and methods are eminently science-compatible, and their background
assumptions coincide with ours (cf. Section 2 and below). In Chapter 6, on psychobiology, MB propose an analysis of concepts such as mind, mind-body
interaction, consciousness, self, voluntariness, free will, etc. Here, we will
give a succinct overview of the notions we need for the derivation of our free
will model. Clearly, MB’s axiomatic and formalized approach is only one
possible theoretical framework for the above concepts; but, it seems to us,
their hypotheses and well-structured theory are programmatic and heuristically
powerful, notably for comparison with neurobiology and computer science. We
will only retain the essence, and will occasionally make small changes as
indicated.
MB closely link the mind with the neuronal states and networks in the human
brain; mind and soul are not conceived of as immaterial, spiritual, perhaps
immortal entities. In this theory, the mind of an animal is construed as the
union, the set of all mental processes of its brain.28 More precisely, MB propose
the following deﬁnition, reproduced here literally29:
DEF-MB-1.Let P denote a plastic neuronal supersystem of animal b of species
K. Then the mind of b during the period τ is the union of all the mental processes (speciﬁc functions πs) that components of P, i.e., plastic neuronal systems n, engage in during τ. More precisely,
M(b, t) = <n ps (n, t).

The other key concepts — plastic neuronal (super)system, mental process, mental function — are also deﬁned in MB’s work.30 However simple, this theory
allows one to address some of the old, paradigmatic problems of the philosophy
of mind. One such question is: where is the mind? Strictly speaking, the mind is
nowhere, since it is a set, hence a conceptual object; only brains, whether

Of course, in this context, the notion of set, a concept of formalized logic, is not the
most user-friendly one; at any rate other less formal conceptualizations are also possible. But we do believe the MB-model is the most economic model that can explain
so much. For the moment we just ask the reader to bear with us, and to judge later,
based on the problems that can be addressed.

minding or not, are somewhere. Further, according to this model, there can be
no real mind-body dualism, thus avoiding an old stumbling block of philosophy,
neither mind-body interaction — as opposed to brain-body interaction. MB
explain in following passage32:
[T]here can be no mind-matter interaction because — unlike individual mental processes
and brains — mind and matter are sets, hence conceptual objects. However, it does make
sense to speak of ‘mental-bodily interactions’ provided this expression is taken to
abbreviate “interactions among plastic neuronal systems, on the one hand, and either
committed neuronal systems or bodily systems that are not part of the CNS [Central
Neuronal System] on the other”. Thus, there are interactions between sensory and
motor areas, between ideational neuronal systems and external receptors, between the
cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, between the brain and the endocrine and
immune system, and so on. Because mental events are neural events, and because the
causal relation is deﬁned for pairs of events in concrete systems (recall Sect. 1.9), we have:
COROLLARY 6.5. Mental events can cause nonmental events in the same body, and
conversely.
Consequently, disturbances of nonmental biofunctions may inﬂuence mental states
and, conversely, mental events such as acts of will may inﬂuence nonmental bodily
states. This is what neurochemistry, neurology, psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine,
psychoneuropharmacology, education, and propaganda are all about.

In a similar vein, and building on the above assumptions, one can then deﬁne
consciousness, deemed the highest of all brain functions by MB. First, they
deﬁne (we only slightly modify their phrasing):
DEF-MB-2. A conscious mental process / choice / act (conceived as based on, governed by, a mental process) is a mental process / choice / act that is monitored (recorded,
analyzed, controlled, or kept track of) by some other mental activity in the same brain.

Simply put: for a mental process or act to be conscious, it must be thought about
by a higher part of the brain.33 And further34:

To us, it seems a priori a quite acceptable hypothesis, in the light of neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings showing that the cognitive centre of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, is connected to
large parts of the brain and seems to function as the ‘integrator’ of information embedded in very many other mental processes. This is the neurobiological intuition that lies at
the basis of MB’s intuition that consciousness of X is related to ‘thinking about X by a
higher level part of the brain’ — presumably the prefrontal cortex.

424 Dialogue
DEF-MB-3. The consciousness of an animal b is the set of all the states (or, rather, processes) of the brain of b in which b is conscious of some perception or thought in b itself.

(This is not a circular deﬁnition thanks to DEF-MB-2.) MB explain35:
According to this convention, an animal can only be conscious of some of its own
higher mental processes: not just feeling, sensing, and doing, but also thinking of
what it perceives or thinks. An animal conscious of mental process x (in itself) possibly undergoes (either in parallel or in quick succession) two different mental processes: x — the object mental process or content of its consciousness, and thinking
about x — i.e., being conscious about x.

Using DEF-MB-2, one can now construct a deﬁnition of the voluntary act as
invoked, for instance, by Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayer.36
DEF-MB-4. An animal act is voluntary (or intentional) IFF it is a conscious, purposeful act.

‘Purposeful’ is left undeﬁned, but is self-explaining; and, for that matter, it
seems less essential to us since it seems that a choice or conscious act can always
be associated with a purpose. And, ﬁnally37:
DEF-MB-5. An animal acts of its own free will IFF
i. its action is voluntary; and
ii. it has free choice of its goal(s) — i.e., is under no programmed or external
compulsion to attain the chosen goal.

In essence, we ﬁnd in clause (ii) the absence of constraint that is the essential
condition for Ayer and others. And ‘voluntary’ in clause (i) and in DEF-A
(iii) is now explained by DEF-MB-4: it means ‘conscious’ and ‘purposeful.’
Therefore, to our satisfaction, we ﬁnd that MB and Ayer deﬁne ‘free will’ in
a very similar manner, moreover a manner that can well be related to a majority
of compatibilist theories on free will, as will be shown further. Let us, for the
moment, omit the notion of purpose in voluntary (which seems less essential
and can be seen to be contained in the notion of ‘choice’). Then, we can synthesize Ayer’s and MB’s models as follows.

The CMT Model of Free Will

425

DEF-MBA. Action A by animal b is ‘free-willed’ or ‘free’ (is made of b’s own free
will) IFF
i. the action A is unconstrained (no programmed or external compulsion), and
ii. the action A is conscious in that the action (linked to a mental process) is monitored (recorded, analyzed, controlled, or kept track of) by some other mental
activity in the brain of b.

So, we have speciﬁed, with MB, that no-constraint is essentially absence of constraint by external agents and by externally programmed inﬂuences. We can now
deﬁne ‘free will’ as the capacity to perform free-willed actions in the sense of
DEF-MBA.
It is worth mentioning that DEF-MBA is, luckily, in a long historical lineage.
Notably, it comes close to Aristotle’s view on free will, but it is also meaningfully linked to Kant’s (cf. Section 6). Aristotle conceived of free will as the
capacity to make choices that are unconstrained and not made of ignorance.38
The latter idea can well be linked to clause (ii) of DEF-MBA, as we will detail
in a moment. Thus, we see appearing in this model of free will the component of
consciousness that we intuitively suspected from the start to be an ingredient of
free will — simply by recognizing or assuming that ‘real’ free will cannot be
attributed to lower animals and is typically a human thing.
A second important thesis we started from is that free will comes in degrees.
We posited this degree-thesis essentially by recognizing that there must be a
(continuous) evolution in free will from primitive humans to modern humans,
and from a new-born child to a knowledgeable adult. A logical question to
ask is then: which concepts in DEF-MBA admit of degree? Constraint does,
but more conspicuously the notions of analysis and control in clause (ii).39
6. Elaboration of the MBA-Model: Is There a ‘Measure’ of the
Variability of Free Will?
If free will comes in degrees, a natural question is: can one then deﬁne a measure
of the variability of free will? A related question that brings this matter sharply to
the point is: can we deﬁne a maximal form of free will? — ‘maximal’ in the
sense of optimal, most adequate. Especially the second question seems complex
and touchy; it is largely absent from the modern debate, but it did peek through
in the views on free will of some of the ancients and Kant. We will use the second question as a heuristic even if speculative tool to try to answer the ﬁrst one.

426 Dialogue

To highlight the relevance of this problem, let us look at a case mentioned by
Meghan Grifﬁth.40 Suppose a young girl, Trina, lives in a closed community that
taught her from her early childhood that stealing from people outside the
community is praiseworthy, the thing to do. Suppose that, on her ﬁrst day at
school, Trina happily puts her worldview into practice and steals several objects
from her little schoolmates. Does Trina do these acts of her own free will? As
argued by Grifﬁth, in this case, many people would accept that Trina was brainwashed (to some degree), and that she is not really blameworthy because she did
not know any better. Thus, many would believe that Trina has no real free will.
This is also what the MBA-model says: while stealing, Trina can surely be conscious of it (she may perform some more or less conscious analysis of some of
her deeds, there may be a little voice in her head saying: ‘yes, stealing from these
girls is cool’), but at the same time, there is a programmed constraint acting, in
the sense that she was brainwashed by parents and community. So, it is clause
(i) that implies that her act of stealing is not free-willed. But, again, it seems clear
that the notion of degree of free will is helpful here: one could say that Trina’s
behaviour is free to some degree, but not an optimal one. She is constrained by
some (harsh or mild) form of brainwashing; and, especially, she monitors, analyzes, controls her deeds by a sub-optimal hypothesis or worldview (namely that
stealing is praiseworthy). To make a link with what follows: she does not seem
to use the optimal assumptions or ‘theory’ to monitor, analyze, and control her
deeds.
Now to our question of whether an optimal form of free will can be deﬁned.
As said, this matter is not the main concern of this article; we ponder rather
superﬁcially about this question to ﬁnd inspiration for our initial problem. It
seems that DEF-MBA does hint at a possibility of qualifying ‘adequate’ free
will. Answering this question amounts to construing the maximal forms of analysis and control that consciousness, our brains, can perform when ‘monitoring’
an act, a choice, a decision. Having analyzed cases such as those of Trina and
many others, we believe that the most synthetic concept to identify the maximal
form of analysis and control is that of ‘theory.’ We use ‘theory’ here in a very
broad sense, including scientiﬁc and academic theories (ethical, philosophical,
sociological, political, physical, …) but more generally also belief systems,
including everyday beliefs and assumptions41; (coherent) bodies of information;
worldviews; etc. We introduce the concept of ‘theory*’ to deﬁne theory in this
broad sense. The link with analysis and control is then quite obvious: in a sense,
it seems it may be said that one always analyzes and controls a conscious act,

40
41

Grifﬁth 2013, 33.
Note that the link between ‘theory’ and ‘assumptions’ is extremely intimate: any
real-world theory, say a theory from physics or ethics, is based on assumptions.
Very simply put: a theory is a set of assumptions and of consequences that are logically derived from the former.

choice, or decision with reference to, or within, a theory*. This seems obvious
when making decisions that need the input of expert ‘intellectual’ knowledge,
but even when making a banal choice, say whether to go to the cinema or
visit a friend on an idle Thursday evening, one ‘analyzes’ or ‘contemplates’
both alternatives within certain beliefs, using certain assumptions — for
instance, assumptions about the satisfaction each activity will provide. (Sure,
the analysis may be barely conscious and ultra-rapid in this example, but we
already agreed that being-conscious-of comes in degrees.) But, to identify
‘maximal analysis’ and ‘maximal free will,’ we better look not at banal cases
but at ethically or intellectually demanding ones. And then it seems quite
clear what optimal, most adequate analysis means: namely analysis within the
‘optimal theory’ — the best theory that we have or have not at hand; the
best-informed or most adequate assumptions on which to base our free choice
or decision. Sure, in many cases, it is not clear what the best theory is, but
then, in many cases it is.42 In short, according to the above analysis, maximal
free will is free will using the optimal beliefs, assumptions, theories*, free
will that is based on using the optimal theories and assumptions in our decision
making — in an ethical context, the best moral theories and principles.
Now, as a ﬁrst indication that we might be on the right track, notice that this
conclusion ﬁts rather closely with what Kant thought about free will in his
Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals.43 There, Kant states, notably: “a
free will and a will under moral laws become one and the same.”44 Thus,
for Kant, real free will is, in essence, will under moral law. In our parlance,
it is will in accordance with (monitored, controlled by) adequate moral
assumptions / theories*.
Now, talking about ‘optimal theories’ might frighten some philosophers;
remember though that we are obviously not looking for criteria for optimal or
even valid theories; nor are we assuming that there always exist theories — in
the narrow sense — for a given context. Importantly, one may not believe in
42

43
44

If one wishes, in cases when the ‘optimal theory’ is unknown, one may consider
‘optimal theory’ as an idealized, hypothetical concept, something as a hypothetical
extrapolation of existing provisional theories. In natural science, for instance, it is
current practice to talk about ‘future better theories’; in physics, mathematical theorems are formulated regarding the features of these ‘more optimal’ future theories,
such as Bell’s theorem. In sum, there seems little doubt that this notion of optimal
theory is operationally useful: one can often well know which theory or assumptions
are better than others (for a given end); the optimal theory (in the absolute sense)
corresponds to the extrapolated, hypothetical end product of this progress.
Philosophy and natural science are rife with this idealized concept, even if we will
likely never know the ultimate theories.

the existence of ‘optimal theories’ while accepting the variability of free will, the
point we want to make. Indeed, we were trying, initially, to identify a measure
for the variability of free will — and we used the speculative reasoning above
about what ‘optimal’ assumptions / theories could be merely as a heuristic
tool for ﬁnding an answer to the initial question. We hope that the result is
clear by now: we suggest that what varies in our capacity to perform actions
that are free according to DEF-MBA is the ‘adequacy’ of the theories* we
use to monitor these actions. In other words, the assumptions and belief systems
involved in monitoring a free act are more or less adequate for guiding these acts.
It is in this sense that one can say that Trina (in the above example) does not
seem to use the optimal assumptions or ‘theory’ to monitor, analyze, and control
her deeds.
As said, these are ﬁrst considerations on this topic of the measure of the
variability of free will; in the following, we will no longer discuss and use the
complex notion of optimal free will / optimal theory. Instead, we will adopt
the MBA-model with the extra assumption that, in clause (ii), the monitoring
(analyzing, controlling) of the conscious brain involves theories* (in a wide
sense), and that these theories* have an adequacy that admits of a degree.
Here, we will call our enhanced MBA-model the ‘CMT model of free will’
(free will as the capacity to perform actions that are Conscious-throughMonitoring-through-Theories*, in short). In the following section, our goal is
to show the potential of this model to subsume other, in particular recent,
theories of free will, and solve problems of these other models. We focus on
compatibilist theories, such as ours. As an additional beneﬁt, we will brieﬂy suggest how our naturalized approach can interface with new research questions in
natural science (Section 8).
7. The CMT Model Compared to Other Theories
A ﬁrst famous theory to consider is Frankfurt’s ‘hierarchical mesh theory’ of
free will.45 In a nutshell, according to this theory, an action or choice A is freewilled if it is object of, if it meshes with, a ‘second-order volition’ or desire — a
higher desire about the ﬁrst-order desire to do A. Then, A is really (rationally)
desired, in agreement with one’s real self, with one’s second-order (rational)
desires; in other words, A ﬂows from the ‘will one wants’ — a reﬂective capacity
animals likely do not have. A priori, it seems clear that this model ﬁts well with
the CMT model, at least that it can charitably be interpreted in resonance with
our model, by noting that second-order volitions are part of the general beliefs,
worldviews, etc. that an agent uses to guide and control her life and actions.
Action A meshes with a second-order volition in that it is consciously monitored
by (assessed, analyzed, etc.) with help of a worldview, a belief system, assumptions of life, in other words, theories*. So, there surely is a partial overlap

between both models. However, it is well known that cases such as Trina’s, the
brainwashed child, are a threat to Frankfurt’s theory.46 Trina may well act in
accordance with higher volitions, really believe in what she does, and therefore
be entirely free, according to Frankfurt’s model — a conclusion with which
most people would disagree. The CMT model solves this problem: Trina is
brainwashed and therefore not unconstrained; and she monitors (assesses) her
deeds through questionable, likely inadequate, beliefs. In other words, one
could say that she has a limited form of free will. Next, there is also a wellknown inﬁnite-regress problem threatening Frankfurt’s theory (why stop at
second-order and not include higher-order volitions?). This problem is absent
from our model for obvious reasons.
A next interesting and inﬂuential theory is Wolf’s Reason View of free will.47
Wolf’s is also a mesh theory, but whereas in Frankfurt’s model free will is, in a
sense, a ‘subjective’ matter (an act is free as long as there is a mesh between the
agent’s choices and his personal, subjective, higher-level desires), Wolf adds
that these personal desires should also have a ‘connection with the world outside’ — they should have an objective dimension, they should “connect with
the True and Good.”48 So, in order to have free will, one should have the
right, objective reasons to do things, reasons that connect to the True and
Good. In a sense, this theory comes quite close to ours. In our model, we
would say that an action should be consciously monitored, guided by a (sufﬁciently) adequate theory*, ethical or other. It seems this can be understood in
Wolf’s parlance as expressing that the agent should have adequate reasons
for her or his act, reasons that “connect with the True and Good,” in the sense
that they are involving, embedded in, backed-up by, adequate theories*. In
view of connecting our model with natural science, we believe, however, that
‘adequate theory’ is a more instrumental and precise concept than ‘adequate reasons,’ also to interface with (computer) science, as explained brieﬂy in Section 8
(see notably the discussion on how computer science could at least partly emulate consciousness); and we avoid the somewhat metaphorical “connection with
the True and Good.” Furthermore, it has been objected to Wolf’s theory that
agents can be manipulated or programmed into accessing the True and
Good.49 We avoid this problem since we assume that a free-willed act should
also be free from programmed or external compulsion, via clause (i) in
DEF-MBA. But, as said, in spirit, there is an obvious connection between
Wolf’s theory and ours. It may be that relying on ‘theories’ and ‘consciousness’
as we do, rather than on ‘reasons’ (as Wolf does) or ‘intelligibility / rationality’
as, for instance, Walter does, is in ﬁnal analysis a matter of taste (and logical

construction of the theory). Still, we submit that the variability of free will, our
essential starting assumption, is conceptualized most precisely via the concept
of theory or rather theory*.
One of the most debated and complex recent theories on free will is Fischer
and Ravizza’s ‘Reasons-Responsiveness View,’ putting an emphasis on the
‘guidance-control’ involved in a free act.50 We will here summarize the essence
of this elaborated theory in a sketchy matter, and reserve more detailed comparison for further work. In a nutshell, an agent has free will if her actions and
choices are sensitive to and respond to reasons, where it is emphasized that
this reasons-responsiveness should not rely on luck, and should not be under
compulsion or neurotic disorder. Rather, the agent should be responsive to reasons through a systematic (cognitive) mechanism that ensures guidance-control
over her actions. To make the link with the CMT model, note that the concept of
conscious control is explicitly mentioned in our basic starting model,
DEF-MBA (clause (ii)). The conscious monitoring (analyzing, controlling) of
an act via adequate beliefs and theories thus implies reasons-responsiveness
and guidance-control (or it could be construed to imply this). So, there is a
partial overlap of the theories. However, Fischer and Ravizza’s ReasonsResponsiveness View is subject to the same criticism as Frankfurt’s theory: it
implies that the brainwashed girl, Trina, steals of her own free will, since she
may well act from a practical reasoning mechanism. Our model is immune to
this worry (cf. above). However, the comparison between the theories can be
made in much more detail, as will plan to show elsewhere.
Finally, Walter51 has proposed a 3-component theory of libertarian free will,
based on an extensive literature review, and with the aim to compare the ingredients of the model to the neuroscientiﬁc investigations by his and other teams.
Again, we can only brieﬂy compare our minimal (2-component) model with his
much more elaborate theory — but in view of the similar goals, this theory is a
relevant reference. Each main ingredient mentioned in a summarizing table52
(brieﬂy, alternativism; intelligibility / rationality; and agency / origination)
can be understood according to Walter’s classiﬁcation in a minimal, moderate,
or maximal version. Comparison shows in a straightforward manner that our
CMT model corresponds to Walter’s alternativism in its minimal interpretation,
plus intelligibility in its moderate interpretation. However, there is a difference:
our model does not explicitly include agency. But we deﬁne the free act of an
agent, and therefore agency can be understood as implicit in this notion of
agent and, especially, as made more explicit by our ‘consciousness’ clause
(ii). Genuine agency would then correspond to the capacity of a subject to act
freely in the sense we deﬁne. Clearly, there may still be advantages to make

agency explicit, in order to investigate certain questions (although, it may be that
this move is more relevant for a libertarian stance). But, as said, we wish to present here a minimal model.
8. Conclusion
Before summarizing the results presented in this article, let us succinctly indicate some avenues of research suggested by the CMT model in neuroscience
and computer science. Of course, within the naturalized tradition, we consider
it a merit of a philosophical model if it can interface with natural science. We
conjecture that our model could be instrumental in tackling questions related
to consciousness — considered an essential but at the same time highly elusive
concept in neuroscience.53 Notably, our model allows us to conceptualize some
aspects of consciousness and free will that could have an empirical basis. We
think here in the ﬁrst place of the process of monitoring by a neuronal superstructure, presumably in the prefrontal cortex, that should represent a theory*.
We believe that it would be interesting to search for the neuronal correlates
for ‘assumptions’ in primates: one conjectures that they are related to memorycircuits, or to the ‘mirror neurons’ that have become fashionable lately.54 Next, it
would be interesting to analyze the well-known Libet experiment through the
lens of our model, as we will do elsewhere. In IT and computer science, a
much debated question is: can future computers and robots simulate consciousness and/or free will? If possible at all, our model suggests that one of the key
properties a computer should have to emulate consciousness, or to approximately mimic it, is the capacity to ‘use’ higher-order theories — and this notably
includes the capacity to adequately apply theories to (all) real-world situations
and to act accordingly. Some will conclude that we are very far from this possibility. This suggests the following line of research: can machines learn to
acquire and use theories*, and, if so, which types and how? Interestingly,
very recently computer scientists and cognitive scientists have indeed come to
the conclusion that mastering theories is a key goal for artiﬁcial intelligence.
In the words of Lake et al.55:
We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and
thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what
they learn and how they learn it. Speciﬁcally, we argue that these machines should (1)
build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather
than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive

It is interesting that these mirror neurons are the basis for the ‘theory of mind’ that
neurobiologists have attributed to primates as the cognitive base for recognizing
the ‘self’ and ‘the other.’

theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is
learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire
and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

And 56:
The alternative approach [alternative to pattern recognition] treats models of the world
as primary, where learning is the process of model-building. Cognition is about using
these models to understand the world, to explain what we see, to imagine what could
have happened that didn’t, or what could be true that isn’t, and then planning actions to
make it so. The difference between pattern recognition and model-building, between
prediction and explanation, is central to our view of human intelligence. Just as scientists seek to explain nature, not simply predict it, we see human thought as fundamentally a model-building activity.

Our model, then, based on well-known analytic models and on the systematic
and wide-ranging work on the conceptual foundations of psychobiology by
Mahner and Bunge, stipulates that a free act is unconstrained (no second
agent or programmed manipulation), and consciously monitored through a theory*. It thus highlights the rational aspect of free will. Further, we emphasized
the fact that free will comes in degrees, a hypothesis that seems natural within a
biophilosophical approach. We submitted that the concept that can
most synthetically and precisely address this variability of free will is that of
theory* — or rather the capacity to use theories*.
Our model is compatibilist, and is independent of whether the universe is ultimately deterministic or indeterministic. If our universe would be deterministic (a
hypothesis for which we presented arguments elsewhere57), here is an example
of how to apply the CMT model. According to our compatibilist position, the
following three facts may be true at the same time:
(i) a murder may be committed by an act of free will (in that the act was
unconstrained and accompanied by a conscious reﬂection based on
some beliefs, assumptions, etc.);
(ii) but the free will of the murderer is likely to be of a corrupted type (her
moral theory* is likely inadequate);
(iii) and at the same time the murder had to happen (in a truly deterministic
universe, there are no alternatives ‘on the atomic scale,’ taking all facts
about the universe into account).

The CMT Model of Free Will

433

An ‘ontic CMT compatibilist’ — someone who assumes both determinism and
that humans can have a form of free will as construed by the CMT model — will
stipulate that claims (i) and (ii) should not be adopted without also considering
(iii); that (iii) should seriously be taken into account. Of course, such a compatibilist ontology may have weighty, and all but trivial, implications for our philosophy of, and our living within, society — maybe notably for our legal,
punitive, and educational practices. In other words, how to apply this type of
compatibilist theory seems an extremely complex matter. But one should
remember that there exist already inﬂuential schools of thought that have theorized the values and consequences of this ontology. One of the oldest and bestdeveloped is Spinozism.
Let us also note that the hypothesis of determinism cannot only be juxtaposed
to the hypothesis of free will; it can also be linked more directly to the different
ingredients of the CMT model. Notably, the theories* that accompany conscious actions are, within a deterministic worldview, acquired by determined,
necessary processes; their acquisition, interpretation, application, etc. may, for
instance, be triggered or inﬂuenced by upbringing, social background, and lifechanging encounters — in any particular case by a potentially quasi-inﬁnite
number of particular causes.
And yet, within our model, there is room for agency, notably through the
capacity we have to learn, to improve our beliefs, and our capacity to act accordingly, to adopt more adequate theories, etc. Our view is all but pessimistic or
defeatist (Spinoza’s theory is all but defeatist); rather, we interpret it as giving
directions on how to become ‘freer.’ Namely by making efforts to acquire
beliefs, views, and theories that help us to deal better with this world.

In a recent paper [1] we have analyzed consequences of the Galilean principle of relativity stating that
motion with any constant speed does not change the laws of physics. We derived all possible reference frame
transformations and found that only two families of observers are mathematically allowed: the subluminal
observers characterized by the usual Lorentz transformation:
x − Vt
x = 
,
1 − V 2 /c2
t − Vx/c2
t = 
1 − V 2 /c2

(1)

for V < c and the superluminal ones given by:
x = −

V
x − Vt

,
|V| V 2 /c2 − 1

t = −

V t − Vx/c2

|V| V 2 /c2 − 1

(2)

for V > c. It is usual to discard the mathematically valid solutions (2) as ‘unphysical’, which, to paraphrase
Orwell, is to say that ‘all inertial frames of reference are equal, but some of them are more equal than the
others’. In our work [1] we have shown that taking into account both families of observers on equal footing,
leads to a familiar non-deterministic quantum-mechanical picture of reality involving quantum
superpositions and complex probability amplitudes. We have concluded that basic laws of quantum theory
are a straightforward consequence of Einsteinian relativity extended to superluminal observers.
In a recent paper [2] Grudka and Wójcik question validity of some of our results and propose an
alternative interpretation of the equations. The ﬁrst criticism is based on their claim that the solutions (2)
can be ruled out based on a ‘symmetry’ argument involving frames with reversed space coordinates. We
would like to point out that since both solutions (1) and (2) equally satisfy the Galilean principle of
relativity and equally preserve the constancy of the speed of light, ruling any of them out must involve some
additional limiting assumption. Indeed, in [2] that assumption is present and it is rooted in the
insufﬁciently general intuition taken from subluminal reference frames that ﬂipping the spatial coordinates
of both frames of reference should be a symmetry. This extra assumption is not true for motions with
superluminal speeds, since the superluminal branch (2) is a hyperbolic rotation of spacetime by the angle
larger than π4 . Therefore reversing the space coordinate of the resting observer should be equivalent of
reversing the temporal coordinate of the superluminally moving observer. This is seen in (2) and especially
in the limiting case of motion with inﬁnite speed, for which the spacetime axes are both rotated by π2 and
(2) reduces to x = ct and ct = x.
We agree that the ‘symmetry’ condition seems to be intuitively reasonable, at least at ﬁrst sight. Yet
formally speaking, it is still an additional mathematical condition that limits the set of possible solutions
and it is not logically necessary. This condition rules out the possibility that time and space could be

exchanged, which is precisely our case. In our work we investigate consequences of Galilean principle of
relativity alone without any extra restrictions.
Next, Grudka and Wójcik point out that conclusions of [1] are based on a ‘hidden assumption’ that
there exist superluminal observers. In fact, this assumption is not hidden at all, it is just a part of the
Galilean principle of relativity, which puts no restriction on possible velocities of inertial observers
whatsoever. Quite contrary, it takes an extra assumption to rule out the superluminal solutions from special
relativity as ‘unphysical’ (and it remains a mystery, how is it not contradicting the principle relativity).
Grudka and Wójcik introduce, what they call ‘a more natural interpretation’ of the coordinate system given
by (2), in which they reinterpret ct as the spatial coordinate and x as the temporal coordinate. Contrary to
the suggestion of the authors of [2] this choice is not a mater of interpretation or convention. A temporal
coordinate of any observer, by deﬁnition, must be parallel to the trajectory of that observer, so that she is
resting in her own co-moving frame. Therefore the transformation to the rest frame of the superluminal
observer must be given by (2) with ct being her temporal coordinate and x her spatial coordinate. No room
for interpretation is left here and therefore being superluminal is relative.
Of course if one assumes that frame velocities are restricted by c, which is the case of the orthodox
formulation of special relativity then these frames are impossible by construction, not by any logical
reasoning. As we show in our work (where we investigate what are the consequences if one starts with
considering inertial frames moving with any velocity) presence of superluminal frames does not lead to any
logical inconsistencies, nor contradict any empirical observations, only challenge our intuitions.
Grudka and Wójcik also make an interesting ﬁnal remark concerning the Schwarzschild spacetime.
Schwarzschild coordinates characterizing such a spacetime correspond to stationary observers placed at
ﬁxed distances from the event horizon. Such observers can be subluminal only above the horizon, and
under the horizon they require superluminal motions. The sign ﬂip in the metric therefore signiﬁes the
transition from a subluminal to a superluminal family of stationary observers residing under the event
horizon in a ﬁxed distance from that horizon. Therefore, the Galilean principle of relativity can be castrated
from half of the solutions resulting in conventional relativity, but this is no longer possible in curved
spacetimes.

Abstract
We discuss critical remarks raised by Horodecki (2023 arXiv:2301.07802 [quant-ph]) toward our
work on the connection between superluminal extension of special relativity and fundamental
aspects of quantum theory.

In a recent paper [1], we demonstrated that extending special relativity to superluminal frames of reference
inevitably leads to fundamental indeterminacy known from quantum theory. Furthermore, we argued that
within this extension, motion along multiple paths also becomes inevitable, drawing parallels with quantum
superpositions. Finally, we established that a probabilistic and covariant description of such motions
necessitates the use of complex probability amplitudes.
These claims elicited several concerns by Grudka and Wójcik [2] as well as Del Santo and Horvat [3],
which we have previously addressed [4, 5]. Recent questions and critiques posed by Horodecki [6] are
addressed below.
Horodecki’s main concern questions whether extended special relativity alone can be used to deduce
quantum theory in its entirety, or if the proposed ‘quantum principle of relativity’ remains incomplete in this
regard. Our short answer is that we do not know yet. While we have demonstrated that some of the most
profound properties of quantum theory, such as its inherent randomness and the superposition principle,
can be deduced from extended relativity, this does not imply that all formal aspects of the theory can be
similarly derived. In fact, we have illustrated that the probability amplitudes formalism represents merely the
simplest covariant solution, leaving room for other potential descriptions.
Horodecki references Heisenberg’s classification of possible universes based on the values of physical
constants 1c and ℏ. Specifically, he considers the scenario where 1c = 0 and ℏ ̸= 0, representing a quantum but
not relativistic model of reality, arguing that the Universe could be quantum, without being relativistic.
However, taking a low-energy limit of Dirac’s theory and arriving at the approximate Pauli equation does not
mean that the resulting theory is truly non-relativistic. In our work we have argued that the reason we have
to consider probabilistic description involving superpositions is due to relativity. Since the approximate Pauli
equation relies on the same quantum structure involving indeterministic behavior and quantum
superpositions, it is hard to call Pauli equation truly ‘non-relativistic’. At this stage it is secondary, whether
the dynamical equation is strict, or only approximate. It is best illustrated by the fact that the
‘non-relativistic’ Pauli theory still involves spin with the gyromagnetic factor g = 2 which is truly relativistic.
It is also in principle possible to imagine a Universe, in which the speed of light is infinite. However this does
not invalidate our claims, that quantum effects are a consequence of relativity, either. To show that, let us
draw an analogy. Elliptical trajectories of planets arise from Newton’s law of gravitation. However, it is
conceivable for a Universe to exhibit such trajectories even in the absence of gravity, driven by entirely
different, alternative laws of physics. Obviously, this does not detract from the earlier assertion that Kepler’s
laws directly originate from Newtonian gravity. It is conceivable that in an alternative Universe quantum
theory might have emerged ‘out of the blue’. However, our reasoning suggests that, in our Universe, several
fundamental aspects of quantum theory are a consequence of relativity. This can also lead to a speculation
that fundamental constants may not be entirely independent, in particular limc→∞ ℏ = 0.

Another observation made by Horodecki is that there are fundamentally two types of indeterministic
events in quantum theory: those due to spontaneous decay processes, and those that occur within the process
of measurement. Horodecki writes, ‘We have no convincing evidence that measurement randomness can
always be attributed to the randomness associated with particle decays’. If we interpret ‘particle decays’ more
broadly as particle interactions (considering that for tachyons a decay can be Lorentz-transformed into a
collision), this statement becomes contentious. Presently, our understanding of physics hinges on elementary
interactions within the standard model. Beyond gravity, there are no other known forces that could account
for the emerging laws of physics. For example, photo-avalanche detectors produce unpredictable readings,
initiated with an interaction between a single photon and a single electron, leading to a microscopic electric
current which is then amplified by the detection mechanism. Consequently, there is no reason to reject the
claim that, according to the present understanding of physics, quantum unpredictability can be traced back
to the unpredictability of individual particle interactions. And, as we argued, the unpredictability of the latter
can be understood using relativistic arguments.
The next question raised by Horodecki is whether the laws of physics, such as the Born rule, can remain
consistent in all reference frames, including superluminal ones, in the 1 + 3 dimensional case, when the
former and the latter can be distinguished (not being fully invariant). The ability to differentiate between
conventional (subluminal) reference frames is not a concern when considering non-inertial frames of
reference. For instance, in the Rindler frame, which corresponds to a relativistically uniformly accelerated
observer, the Born rule continues to apply seamlessly. Distinguishability of that frame from inertial frames is
not a problem. Hence, the fact that superluminal inertial observers employ a different metric than their
subluminal counterparts should not present any problem neither. In fact, general covariance, which is the
foundation of general relativity, states that the laws of physics should not be affected by the choice of
coordinates. The quantum principle of relativity that we proposed simply extends this domain of possible
coordinate systems to include superluminal observers.
Horodecki notices that in the derivation of the expressions for complex probability amplitudes we only
employ conventional, subluminal covariance between frames. This is true. However the questions that have
to be answered first are: why do we need to look for a probabilistic description of particle dynamics, and why
do we need to consider motion along multiple paths in the first place? These questions are justified only by
considering superluminal frames of reference. And they provide us with a justification to look for
relativistically invariant probability distributions.
Finally, Horodecki raises a crucial and well-founded critique: does our proposal yield any measurable and
potentially observable effects? The straightforward answer is: if tachyons existed, then this would
undoubtedly be the case. It is worth noting that we have recently demonstrated that a covariant quantum
field theory of tachyons with a positive-definite spectrum and a stable, invariant vacuum can be constructed
[7]. In this study, as well as in our previous work [8], we emphasize that the Higgs mechanism incorporates
tachyonic fields. As a result, our ongoing research opens the way to study fully quantized theory of
spontaneous symmetry breaking. This leaves us with a hope that the answer to the last question posed by
Horodecki is affirmative.

a review of factitious disorders and malingering in the Lancet
and in 2017 [with Dr Yates] a systematic review of the perpetrators of medical child abuse.
The bulk of his medico legal work involves assessment in
cases of persistent pain and ‘functional’ disorders after accidents, and summarised in a recent review in the Journal of
Personal Injury Law, 2021.
Abstract Malingering is an emotive word which is not advisable to use in a medico-legal context or correspondence. It
describes a behavioural strategy, not a mental illness, and glossary definitions are not only unhelpful but misleading. Alternative terms will be suggested for the spectrum of behaviour
subsumed under the term Malingering. Prevalence rates are
estimated to be as high as 30% in settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, but its frequency in clinical practice is unknown.
In this talk I will describe those neurological disorders
where difficulty in determining the degree of symptom exaggeration/amplification is most likely in medico-legal settings.
These include mild traumatic brain injury, functional neurological disorder [FND], and a controversial syndrome called complex regional pain syndrome Type 1.
A thorough and detailed interview is essential. In medicolegal settings this is facilitated by the investigating clinician
being provided with multiple sources of additional information
such as witness statements and employment records. Because a
person’s recollections of their past symptoms, illnesses and
episodes of care are often inconsistent from one enquiry to
the next, establishing a chronology or ‘time-line’ of
The legal concept of Fundamental dishonesty, introduced in
2015 under Section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Courts
Act, will be briefly described, as will recent Court judgements
of relevance to neuropsychiatrists. Case vignettes will be presented to demonstrate examples of symptom exaggeration
leading to the termination of a medicolegal case.
Causal mechanisms will be briefly described, which include
putative organic factors and psychological mechanisms that
showcase the relevance of cognitive dissonance for research on
malingering.
Finally, techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include use of covert surveillance and review of social
medica accounts, and brief mention will be made of these.
Specialised psychological tests based on negative response bias

Abstract Functional neurologic disorder often occur in association with physical trauma or psychologically stressful events.
This means they are commonly a complication of accidents
and as recognition improves they are more commonly encountered ing the setting of personal injury. It is important to recognise that there is nothing new here, similar patients and
presentations have been recognised in the Court over the past

such cases and how one might attempt to integrate current
scientific understanding in a way that helps the Court decide
what has happened and who was to blame.
We will cover diagnosis, exaggeration, onset, risk and triggers and treatment.

its impairment in specific disorders, has implications both for

low levels of interoceptive processing are integrated with
higher-order, metacognitive beliefs about one’s self-efficacy and

Abstract

The commentary encourages supplementing the geological and natural concept of the
Anthropocene with a cultural and political aspect. These two perspectives are not mutually exclusive but are
complementary. This approach can facilitate its transition from the language of academic debate to practical and
necessary actions at the societal level. According to the authors, the slightly abstract and impersonal
Anthropocene should be shown in the context of cultural, economic and political dependencies and choices that
created it and continue to reproduce its logic. This turn also opens up a new area for analyzing the Anthropocene
from the perspective of a critique of political economy (an analysis of the costs of economic policies that
reproduce and accelerate successive stages of the ecological catastrophe) as well as of civic culture (research
“anthropocentric awareness” or “anthropocentric citizenship” in entire societies). Thus, the authors suggest
rejecting the fatalistic determinism of the Anthropocene as a process that, although originally caused by abstract
(devoid of historical, economic and political contexts) humans, is now often treated as a phenomenon beyond
the reach of social action.

Plain Language Summary

Can the concept of the Anthropocene, which originated in the geological
sciences, but is now increasingly used by the media and in public space, be clearly defined from the perspective
of the social sciences? In our opinion, the social understanding of the Anthropocene can facilitate its transition
from the academic debate and the image of the Pop‐Anthropocene disseminated by the media to the creation of a
necessary and practical policy framework. We also suggest treating the Anthropocene not as an abstract idea in
the geological and natural sciences, which is difficult for common people to understand, but as a phenomenon
that brings political and economic consequences in the real social world. What is more, this phenomenon
depends on political and economic forces that have never been anonymous. This turn breaks with the lack of
political responsibility for the ecological consequences of decisions made by political and economic decision‐
makers, as well as for the thoughtless attitudes of all other participants in social life.

1. The Anthropocene Has Many Faces: Between Academic Debate and Social Action
The authors of a very interesting review of the concept and meaning of the term “Anthropocene” in various
scientific disciplines, published in Earth's Future, have concluded:
A situation has arisen where, as a result of different disciplinary perspectives, a widely useful term,
which refers to a time when human forces are predominant in shaping nature, has evolved into
overlapping but distinct concepts (Zalasiewicz et al., 2021).

However, at least the general framework of the term needs to be accepted to conduct an academic debate.
Otherwise, using the same concept, researchers might be talking about something else. Although social sciences
are not the realm of unambiguity—and many of the terms used there penetrate everyday language, while terms
from social sciences find their way into the language of the media and politics—social scientists cannot use
concepts with a specific meaning framework completely freely and arbitrarily. To avoid conceptual confusion, it
is always worth referring to the socio‐historical context in which a given conceptual apparatus occurs (there have
already been such attempts at contextualizing the term “Anthropocene”) (Biermann et al., 2016). On the other
hand, it is worth trying to conceptualize the term for the purposes of specific measurable and verifiable empirical
research, political criticism and policy recommendations. There were similar problems with defining a clear
conceptual framework for terms such as “civil society,” “civil energy,” “just transition,” “democracy,” and
1 of 10

“equality” (Żuk & Żuk, 2022). However, it is worth trying to organize the concept of the Anthropocene and to
facilitate its transfer from the language of academic debate into the sphere of practical social activities. Namely,
this concept, which is becoming increasingly popular in the media, has huge research and political potential. The
term was popularized by atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen, who declared at the International Geosphere‐
Biosphere Program meeting in Cuernavaca, Mexico in February 2000, “We're not in the Holocene any more.
We're in the … Anthropocene!” (Crutzen, 2002).
Crutzen used the term “Anthropocene” not based on stratigraphic studies, but owing to a direct perception and
understanding of the Earth's changing system. From the beginning, his concept of the Anthropocene as a new
geological epoch indicated a crisis and transformation of the relationship between man and existing social systems with the Earth. Can treating the Anthropocene as an entirely human‐made project make it easier to create a
conscious path of departure from the socio‐political model of development that leads nature and human civilization to an inevitable catastrophe? Today, the concept of the Anthropocene which functions at the intersection of
the world of science and the media increasingly takes the form of Popular Anthropocene and resembles neo‐
Malthusian eco‐catastrophism (Moore, 2023) (reducing humanity to a homogeneous population in which there
is no room for a critical analysis of the interdependent influence of various political and political models on the
fate of the Earth, nature, climate and individual social classes). The Anthropocene understood and perceived in
this way may lead to the creation of another category of literature in bookstores or may be another element of
popular culture that inspires the creation of disaster films and books but does not change anything in the real
world.
It can be said that there are currently three types of social actors who raise the issue of the Anthropocene in public
debate. On the one hand, there are academics and local social activists who deeply analyze various aspects of
threats related to the Anthropocene (but they do not agree on whether it is possible to change current trends and
how to turn theory into national and global actions). On the other hand, the simplified image of the Pop‐
Anthropocene that is present in the media does not bring any social effects and can only inspire the production of catastrophic and commercial messages in popular culture. The fact that the concept itself is present in
social circulation does not mean that it is understood and that appropriate actions are taken. The analysis of the
simplified and unclear image of the Anthropocene disseminated by the media leads to the following conclusion:
In fact, it is rather evident that the lack of a consistent discussion of the Anthropocene does not
solely stem from a poor scientific understanding of its ecological drives, but also by the lack of
political awareness and a general unpreparedness to face the socio‐environmental implications of
the Age of Humankind (Zottola & de Majo, 2022).
Politicians are the third type of actors who touch upon the topic of tensions in the relationship between nature and
the prevailing system. However, the vast majority of them, at recurring climate conferences, mainly try to disarm
and neutralize the social anger of movements and civic initiatives that are a response to the effects of the
Anthropocene. In other words, the political class usually tries to depoliticize climate challenges and reduce them
to technical problems that can be solved using appropriate technology, without the need to introduce deep changes
in socio‐political systems.
Each of the three variants of dealing with the Anthropocene is deprived of a political context and is not translated
into the language of public problems covering entire societies. This is a classic situation in which public problems
are reduced to private concerns of individuals or small niche groups. Wondering whether politics could exist at all
in a market and individualized society, Zygmunt Bauman wrote:
The snag is, though, that these days the most common troubles of the individuals‐by‐fate are not
additive. They simply do not sum up into a “common cause.” They are shaped from the beginning
in such a way as to lack the edges or “interfaces” allowing them to be dovetailed with other
people’s troubles. Troubles may be similar …, but unlike the common interest of yore they do not
form a “totality which is greater than the sum of its parts” and acquire no new quality, easier to
handle, by being faced up to and confronted together (Bauman, 2001, p. 48).
This view fits well with the challenges of the Anthropocene.
However without a global political perspective and clearly defined ecological risks posed by specific economic
and political logic, quick decisions and changes going beyond narrow groups of experts will not be possible. In

this commentary, we want to: (a) show that the perspective of the social sciences does not have to be opposed to
that of the natural and geological sciences, but all of them can complement each other well; (b) emphasize the
need for taking a cultural and political perspective in the debate on the Anthropocene and the future fate of the
Earth, its residents (both human and non‐human animals) and the entire natural world; (c) reject the fatalistic
determinism of the Anthropocene as a process that, although originally caused by some abstract and anonymous
humans, is now often treated as a phenomenon beyond the reach of social action; (d) treat the Anthropocene not as
a politically neutral project, but as a phenomenon causally related to specific political and economic forces that
are not and have never been anonymous, and outline the resulting difficulties in developing a critical political
perspective on the Anthropocene. In our opinion, this perspective may accelerate practical actions to save the
climate and avoid an ecological catastrophe on Earth. In this sense, we treat the Anthropocene as it deserves: not
only as an academic idea but also as a practical challenge that not only triggers geological and environmental
consequences but also brings or may bring social, economic and political effects. We recognize that combining
the geological and natural perspective with the cultural and political perspective can take the Anthropocene from
the level of theory and put it into social practice.

2. The Dispute Between Naturalism and Anti‐Naturalism
The different perspectives of the natural sciences and the social sciences in explaining and defining the phenomenon of the Anthropocene come down to the classic dispute between naturalism and anti‐naturalism. The
latter position, which was originally developed by humanistic sociology, rejects the idea that social reality is
simply part of nature, and thus rejects the methodological assumption that the social world should be studied in the
same way as the natural world. If we recognize the Anthropocene as a cultural reality (and not only as geological
and natural processes), then we cannot be bound by the naturalistic formula of experience in our analyses. As
Florian Znaniecki (1992, p. 136) claimed, cultural facts can be reduced “neither to objective natural reality nor to
subjective psychological phenomena.” The Anthropocene has hard natural indicators (temperature increase, the
impact of accelerating global warming on increasingly extreme weather phenomena (Papalexiou & Montanari, 2019), catastrophic fires (Senande‐Rivera et al., 2022) and rising sea levels (Tebaldi et al., 2021)), yet it
causes objective psychological states (“eco‐anxiety” and social anxiety (Verplanken et al., 2020), the anger of
young climatic activists (Svensson & Wahlström, 2023)). However, it is primarily a socio‐cultural construct, not
only a product of human activity and its various systems of production and domination but also a construct
defined and described by and sparking numerous polemics in the socio‐cultural dimension. For modern social
sciences, the Anthropocene is primarily a social product that affects the quality and living conditions of the human
species, all other non‐human animals and the entire natural world. Nevertheless, it cannot be treated as a
manifestation of determinism of impersonal “forces of nature” or anonymous geological and biological processes.
Breaking with the determinism of nature does not mean ignoring the complex and almost dialectic relationship
between society and the natural world: the relationship between them is permanent. All social, cultural and
political models are a response to “objective” natural conditions, but at the same time they transform these
“natural conditions.” In this sense, the human environment is both social and natural. As Berger and Luckmann
wrote in their classic work entitled The Social Construction of Reality, “the developing human being not only
interrelates with a particular natural environment, but with a specific cultural and social order” (Berger &
Luckmann, 1991, p. 68). In other words, “From the moment of birth, man's organismic development, and indeed a
large part of his biological being as such, are subjected to continuing socially determined interference” (Berger &
Luckmann, 1991, p. 68). From this cultural perspective, the Anthropocene should be treated in two ways: as an
objective “natural and geological” state and also as a defined model of “social, cultural and economic” relations,
placed in a specific historical and political context. The relationship between these two dimensions created the
phenomenon of the Anthropocene in the past and continues to affect the further phases and fate of the Anthropocene. Without a perspective in which these two dimensions intertwine and interact, it is impossible to formulate
political postulates and practical strategies of action that, by changing the socio‐political system, can simultaneously affect the natural and geological trajectory, pushing away the vision of a self‐fulfilling catastrophe. Frank
Biermann (2021) is right when he claims that the artificial dichotomy between “nature” and “humans” is not only
indefensible, but it also deemphasizes questions of planetary justice and democracy and may risk political
marginalization of central concerns of human and non‐human survival.
Some contradictions within the discussion on the Anthropocene have already been questioned as they prevent the
debate from developing a cultural and social perspective. As rightly claimed, “in climate change, social relations

determine natural conditions; in Anthropocene thinking, natural scientists extend their world‐views to society”
(Malm & Hornborg, 2014, p. 66). Moreover, negating the artificial division into “natural” and “socio‐cultural”
makes it possible to create the category of not only “common heritage,” but also of “common worlds” or
“common futures” (Harrison, 2015). Now, in the third decade of the 21st century, when climate change has
accelerated even more, it is important to give social analyses and concepts of the Anthropocene a political
perspective. The Anthropocene can be understood as a global political phenomenon not only in the sense of
growing interdependence (Biermann, 2014) but also as the result of political choices and the historic domination
of a specific political power. This perspective allows us to see that the Anthropocene is entangled in power relations and that capital adversely affects the environment and the people's classes. It also creates space for political
demands and facilitates the creation of recovery programmes. This perspective also makes it possible to
democratize the debate about the fate of the Earth, break the dominant narratives that blur responsibility for the
current situation and extend the discussion to circles and environments that have not participated in it so far (e.g.,
those who are more concerned about the cost of living than ecological threats and for whom such considerations
are the entertainment of academic “wise guys” and “green” eco‐business, and the ecological lifestyle itself seems
unattainable without changing the rules of capitalism). This would involve translating the Anthropocene into the
language of everyday life practice and the perspective of the people's classes. In this way, indifference and
ignorance about the future of the Earth are also reduced. Moving the issues of the Anthropocene permanently
from academic halls and discussion boards to the main agenda of political challenges globally and in individual
countries can make the political debate more realistic and, at the same time, reclaim the classic role of the university which is a link between critical diagnosis, new politics and class people.
Even among those who see a new political space for the Anthropocene, there are significant differences as to what
the framework of the Anthropocentric political perspective should be (Lövbrand et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there
is a consensus that the meaning of the social environment is undergoing changes in the new conditions of the
Anthropocene, just like the definitions of geopolitical threats are changing (Dalby, 2017). All this makes it
necessary to redefine the framework of political conflicts.

3. The Political Character of the Anthropocene: A Few Words About the Political
Differentiation of Systems Affecting Natural Processes
Climatic migration is an example of a new political conflict that may symbolize the politicization of the
Anthropocene. The phenomenon of climatic migration (Nukusheva et al., 2021), the full phase of which is still
ahead of us, illustrates the spatial differentiation of areas that are either more or less conducive to the life of the
human species. Is this spatial differentiation only the result of climatic, geographic and natural differentiation? To
a large extent, this is the case, but it is also a manifestation of the diverse socio‐political systems existing on the
Earth in the past. It is a cliché to say that the quality of air, water and climate depends to a large extent on the
economic, political and legal standards in force in a given country. If so, the different phases of the Anthropocene
depend both on the entire Earth and in individual continents, on historical and contemporary political systems. To
emphasize the meaning of this statement, it is worth asking some thought‐provoking questions: Can the
Anthropocene be imagined in a system of production characteristic of a slave system or early Middle Ages?
Would the Anthropocene be possible in an anarchist society or one based on the dominant role of local worker
cooperatives, which are not guided—like contemporary political systems and the elites of state authorities—by
the logic of growth domestic product but, for example, by the complacency of their employees? These questions
boil down to a fundamental question: is the Anthropocene, which was born during the Industrial Revolution, in
fact, the history of capitalism and its impact on social and natural life?
A positive answer to this question, however, still does not exclude the diversity of capitalism itself and its various
models, and thus the different degrees and manners of its impact on both people's lives and the world of nature.
Namely, the dominance of global capitalism in the modern world does not mean that capitalism had the same face
everywhere and exerted the same influence on the environment and the Earth (without extensive analysis, one can
agree that the approach to the environment and ecological legislation were different in the neoliberal model of
capitalism known primarily in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) and the model of “Rhenish
capitalism” during the welfare‐state period and the grassroots ecological movements in Germany of the 1970s.
Hence, there is the concept of the capitalocene, which is understood as a system of power, profit and re/production
in the web of life and also emphasizes the importance of a historical perspective that extends into the past, much
earlier than the 20th century commonly associated with the Anthropocene. According to Jason W. Moore (2017),

capitalist logic was based on the concept of Cheap Nature as a system of domination, appropriation and
exploitation even at the dawn of modernity.
When did the accumulation and absolute domination of the rules of global capitalism associated with the great
acceleration and global change generally considered to be the beginning of the Anthropocene occur? Post‐1950
events have been usually indicated as the cut‐off date for the beginning of the Anthropocene, when energy
consumption, gross domestic product growth, population growth, production growth and global ocean temperatures began to increase rapidly (Syvitski et al., 2020). It is worth emphasizing that these processes occurred along
with the dynamics of capital accumulation and growing social inequalities, which were observed particularly after
the neoliberal counter‐revolution of the 1980s initiated by Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain and Ronald Reagan
in the United States.
However, another question arises: if the Anthropocene is a product of capitalist relations of production and state
political rule, would their change or rejection transform the dynamics of the Anthropocene or even offer a chance
to undo the processes initiated by this epoch in the environment? This perspective has been outlined by John
Bellamy Foster, who emphasizes that creating a new order is not only possible but even necessary to save life on
Earth. How should this be done? Foster does not doubt:
The new, essential ecological civilization, is nothing less than a worldwide ecological and social
revolution against the capitalist mode of production—a revolution that is most likely to emerge
first in the Global South, given the depth of the economic and ecological crises (Foster, 2022).
By rejecting capitalist logic and looking for a global political space to save the Earth, we must also abandon the
nationalist tradition and economic nationalism, which are not only historically related to capitalism (Conversi, 2023) but are also incongruent with the current global environmental and climate challenges (Conversi, 2022a). Industrialization and the development of nation states and nationalist movements historically
coincided. Today, in times of crisis and the fight for dwindling resources, nationalism is once again a response of
and support for capitalist states. This tactical alliance is at odds with the desired policies of the Anthropocene era,
which could be the answer to the planetary crisis (Conversi, 2022b).

4. Challenges for the Political Perspective of the Anthropocene and Obstacles to the
Politicization of Actions to Protect the Earth
Although the challenges of the Anthropocene are global, traditional politics is implemented within the borders of
nation states and is therefore unable to respond to transnational phenomena. Moreover, states also have the
ambition to control and manage the environment under the principle of territorial exclusivity: “Mechanisms used
by governments to tackle global problems are frequently very much about local control, about national sovereignty and border practices” (Dalby, 2020, p. 146). These mechanisms are applied despite the transnational
challenges of climate policy and the Anthropocene. However, it is not only about developing transnational
climate policy, but also about politicizing relations between humans and non‐humans, extending justice and the
sphere of human morality to non‐humans, and initiating a withdrawal from a human‐dominated world that is the
legacy and consequence of capitalist logic (Epstein, 2023). This would require a radical change in social relations
and human/non‐human relations from constant competition and the desire to colonize to mutual cooperation and
care work that is frequently invisible or devalued (Corwin & Gidwani, 2024).
The logic of efficiency and effectiveness that is typical of capitalist instrumental rationality is also an obstacle to
the social and political activity that should be taken in response to the Anthropocene. Namely, instead of thinking
about changing the social order and its relationship with the world of nature, the strategy of “security rationality”
is applied. Thus, the current state power elites continue to maintain a monopoly over “corrective actions” and use
the discourse of security or “emergency situation” to avoid real social changes. Such tactics once again make it
difficult to politicize the Anthropocene: “In the place of social relations, knowledge production practices around
the Anthropocene produce instead security relations” (Fagan, 2023, p. 17).
Among the main problems in politicizing the Anthropocene (understood as the creation of a common macro‐
social strategy that goes beyond the efforts of dispersed, fragmented and isolated stakeholder groups) is that
climate‐related activity is reduced to individual responsibility. While morally this perspective may be based on
real feelings, individualized approaches may limit the collective imagination about the types of changes that are
necessary to address planetary damage (Soneryd & Uggla, 2015). This methodological and cognitive

reductionism means that individual responsibility for environmental problems is placed on an anonymous individual, leaving little room for reflections on the politics of institutions, nature and changes in social power
relations (Maniates, 2001).
This also makes it easier to completely blur political responsibility and reduce the entire strategy of saving the
Earth to the slogan “We are in the same ship” (Arsel, 2023). This approach perpetuates current trends and the
belief that without social conflict and political changes, it is possible to develop sustainable policies that will save
the environment.
On the other hand, some opinions point to the need to combine the individual level of various stakeholders with
the level of systemic changes so that “individualized responsibility and accountability and transformative systemic change can be seen as two sides of a single coin” (Macdonald, 2023). Indeed, the growing individual
concerns about the future of the Earth may be an additional argument for the need to politicize the Anthropocene.
Eco‐anxiety is a form of alienation that is “caught between the feeling of helplessness in the face of inaction on the
climate crisis and a desire for a collective subject that can fundamentally shape the Anthropocene.” This leads to
“the recognition that the planetary crises of the present have been shaped by acts of human sociality and can, in
turn, be reshaped by collective political agents” (Davidson, 2023, p. 12).
Another argument for exceeding the limits of traditional politics in the Anthropocene is the scale of natural
hazards and disaster risk, which, on the one hand, have ceased to be local phenomena and have become global,
and on the other, are part of the system of social inequalities. In this way, social, procedural and spatial inequalities influence the scale of disaster risk (Cutter, 2021). If activists and academics are convinced that changes
in financial, legal, political and governance systems are necessary for sustainable and resilient futures
(McPhearson et al., 2021), this raises the question about the directions of political changes. Regardless of the
diverse and competing suggestions and guidance regarding the future political models that can protect life on
Earth, there is nonetheless a sense of the need to abandon the logic and practice of neoliberal capitalism. Each
time, critical reflections lead to the conclusion that the Anthropocene is less a geological age defined by human
activity as much as the compounding consequences of a relatively small segment of humanity, so too is
neoliberalism traceable to specific people, histories, and institutions (Kingsbury, 2023).
4.1. The Politicization of the Anthropocene, “Dangerous Conflict” and the Radicalization of the Political
Paradigm: Beyond Nation‐State Politics and Market Logic
Although capitalist logic is dominant, there were periods in the history of the 20th century when its influence on
nature was varied and nuanced. An interesting illustration of this spatial and temporal differentiation may be the
fall of communism in the late 1980s in Eastern European countries. Numerous branches of industry were privatized or liquidated (this was the effect of capital accumulation; the economies constituting the core of the global
capitalist system got rid of competition from Eastern Europe and, above all, total production activity largely
decreased at that time) (Vukina et al., 1999), unintentionally deindustrializing the economy. This, in an unplanned
way and somewhat as a side effect, led in the 1990s to a temporary improvement in the quality of water, air and the
general condition of the natural environment in Eastern European countries. A similar effect was observed during
the COVID‐19 pandemic on a global scale in 2020–2021 when air quality improved temporarily (Albayati
et al., 2021). Would these “emergencies” in the global economy change the trajectory of the Anthropocene if they
had lasted longer? If we assume they would, we must consequently recognize that we, as people creating specific
socio‐political and economic systems, can change the pace and phases of the Anthropocene, and perhaps even
eliminate its significance from the natural and geological perspective. If political and economic systems created a
path for human development that moved the human species and the entire natural world into the Anthropocene,
can political and economic systems make another shift to establish greater harmony between the social and the
natural worlds? In this way, another provocative question can be posed: can breaking the rule of state logic (based
on the control of people and resources of the natural world in a given territory) and/or rejecting market logic
(which can commodify every natural resource and turn it into a product for sale with a certain market value)
change the history of the Earth, influence the trajectory of the Anthropocene and stop the Great Acceleration?
(Steffen et al., 2015) If we accept this possibility, new possibilities open up in which man and society can become
the creators of the post‐Anthropocene (“the Communion” as described by John Bellamy Foster) (Foster &
Clark, 2021). From this perspective, both the beginning and end of the Anthropocene cease to be anonymous and
it becomes possible to identify specific social and political forces that can play the role of the environmental

proletariat as the main drive to stop the current catastrophic trends in the social and natural environment. It is not
only about those who potentially form the environmental proletariat, which is “a class in itself,” and a just
transition combining environmental and social issues can be consistent with their interests (indigenous peoples,
ethnic minorities, peasants, rural communities and working‐class families) (Faber et al., 2021), but about those
who are “a class for itself” and are aware that the role of the environmental proletariat is in line with their interests.
Who should play this role in individual countries and on a global scale is of course one of the basic questions for
social research. Either way, there is a return to the language of class in discussions about the politics of the
Anthropocene, which highlights the broader tensions inherent in the relationship between nature, society and
capital (Arsel, 2023). This may be the answer to why the politicization of the Anthropocene, which shows the
structural political‐economic constraints on earth system stability (Albert, 2020), becomes a potentially
“dangerous conflict” from the point of view of political and economic elites. Namely, the demand that capital and
nation states abandon the monopoly on managing the Earth and its resources is an invitation to broad and radical
social changes of a transnational nature (Quinn, 2023).

5. Research and Practical Conclusions for the Socially Defined Anthropocene
Should the geological concept of the Anthropocene be rejected in the context of a social perspective? Definitely
not. But it is worth complementing and strengthening it with cultural and political aspects. The socially produced
description of the effects of human activity has already become a legitimate and objectively existing social fact in
culture. It is described, criticized and discussed as a social fact, not as an abstract idea or poetry. Therefore, the
term “Anthropocene” should not be excluded from the language of the debate, but it should be specified, clearly
defined in the social sciences and supplemented with the cultural, political and economic dimensions omitted
from the “naturalistic concepts.” Social scientists do not have to be experts in biology and geology (just as geologists do not have to be outstanding sociologists or political scientists), but it would be good for these two
perspectives to be complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
If we say A and accept the social context of the Anthropocene, then we must say B and deal with the social and
political implications of this epoch. We indeed have no influence on the time and socio‐historical context in which
we came into the world as humans. However, if we accept the social character of the Anthropocene, it means that
we recognize that the human species and the social system reproduced or changed by people are their product and
a process in which they consciously or unknowingly participate. This means that not only can the Anthropocene
be reproduced, but it can also be transformed by man who creates Social History and influences the History of
Nature. Adopting this assumption opens up huge areas for research and several social policies.
As we have tried to show in this commentary, the socio‐cultural dimension of the Anthropocene also allows us to
put an end to its anonymous and slightly dehumanized character. There is a certain paradox in the original
concepts of the Anthropocene: on the one hand, the human species is pointed out as a force (social, economic,
industrial) influencing the condition of the Earth. On the other hand, the same human species is subjected to the
process of desocialization and treated as passive beings who are not only influenced by the blind forces of nature
and geology but also, and perhaps above all, by the blind and anonymous economic and political forces
responsible for the current state of the Earth. In this way, the prevailing political order is almost equated with
geological determinism and recognized as something “natural” and, at the same time, inevitable. This is what
requires a change in the discussion about the ways and means of reaching the post‐Anthropocene, understood as
both a geological epoch and a social order restoring more harmonious relations between the environment and the
social world.
What elements of the current debates about the Anthropocene are worth developing in this context, and which
ones should be introduced into these discussions?
The global and supranational nature of the Anthropocene certainly weakens nationalist positions and attempts to
enclose environmental challenges within individual nation states. In this sense, it is a useful tool for criticizing all
nationalisms and national particularisms represented particularly by political forces associated with the populist
right and disregarding or undermining environmental policy, climate change and global, cosmopolitan responsibility for the fate of the Earth (Kulin et al., 2021; Żuk, 2023a; Żuk & Szulecki, 2020). For this reason, this
supranational and transnational perspective should be continued, and resource nationalism, which is inconsistent
with climate protection and global environmental challenges, should be abandoned (Conversi, 2020).

However, it is worth talking openly about the economic costs of the Anthropocene in economic activity and
political decisions that reproduce the present state and those that can stop the current trajectory. The critique of the
political economy of the Anthropocene makes it possible to indicate the specific economic value of individual
trajectories of socio‐economic development resulting from additional costs related to climate change (the costs of
fires and additional expenses related to health care and climate migration, the costs of saving endangered plant
species and animals, etc.). This could also start a discussion about what practical actions and instruments need to
be taken in the political economy to stop the dynamics of the Anthropocene. In addition to the revolutionary
perspective, which aims to undermine the foundations of the logic of the Capitalinian Age (defined as the period
of acceleration of global monopoly capitalism in the 1950s, which led to the era of planetary ecological crisis)
(Foster & Clark, 2021), evolutionary actions are also possible. For example, the “anthropocentric tax” can be
charged on the activities of large corporations or the mining industry that have a particular impact on perpetuating
the framework and socio‐ecological effects of the Anthropocene. It can be paid to the “global climate rescue
fund.” This can be called an introduction to the discussion about the anthropocentric critique of political economy.
However, such actions cannot ignore other main dimensions of public life: social policy that will support lower
classes in bearing the costs of the green transition, new tasks for universities, which should combine climate
science with social and cultural perspectives (Naylor & Veron, 2021), critical education that will not exclude and
discourage young people from lower classes from supporting ecological policy (Żuk, 2023b), as well as a new
model of regional development for those who will not benefit from energy transition (residents of coal basins and
employees of the mining industry and the traditional energy sector) (Żuk, 2023c).
On the other hand, on the socio‐cultural level, it is possible to research “anthropocentric awareness” or
“anthropocentric citizenship” (understood as an active attitude on the individual, national and global levels to the
challenges and threats related to the environmental disaster on the Earth, going beyond the current political and
cultural limitations). Emphasizing the importance of the socio‐cultural dimension makes it possible to break the
static and anonymous foundations of anthropocentric processes. This consequently unveils the mask of neutrality
and the lack of political responsibility for the ecological consequences of decisions made by political and economic decision‐makers, as well as for the thoughtless attitudes of all other participants in social life. Both these
shifts—adopting a socio‐cultural perspective and consequently imposing economic costs and emphasizing political responsibility—are insufficient for a radical change in the trajectory of processes taking place on Earth.
However, they are necessary to break the atmosphere of indifference of the political and business establishment,
as well as other social actors and individuals to the fate of the Earth. The slightly abstract and impersonal
Anthropocene should be shown in the context of cultural, economic and political dependencies and choices that
created it and continue to reproduce its logic.

Quantum transition between spaces in a multidimensional Universe
and spatial unconnectivity explain free will and solve the measurement

Abstract: Spacetime is deterministic, but the Universe appears to be stochastic. How to reconcile
free will with the determinism inherent to the Universe? In this essay, we postulate that free will
can only emanate from the existence of multiple additional spatial dimensions constituting the
Universe. As our space displaces through the temporal dimension, we can choose any of the
infinite possibilities defined by the additional spatial dimensions, through a process we refer to as
quantum transition between spaces. Reality would emerge from the specific materialization of this
quantum transition, resulting in a time series of events. This materialization is based on a
fundamental property of any space, independently of its dimensions, which we refer to as spatial
unconnectivity. This property implies the inability of the constituents of a particular space to
observe spaces located in other dimensions. Therefore, the unconnectivity between spaces would
prevent the simultaneous observation of all possible events at a specific time point, as well as past
and future events, resulting in a unique reality. It would be the observers who determine the
temporal trajectory of events, thus providing themselves with free will. In the absence of observers,
all possibilities are feasible, thus explaining the quantum properties of elementary particles when
they are not directly observed. Our model reconciles quantum mechanics with relativistic physics

concilier le libre arbitre avec le determinisme inherent a l’Univers? Dans cet essai, nous postulons
que le libre arbitre ne peut emaner que de l’existence de multiples dimensions spatiales
supplementaires constituant l’Univers. Lorsque notre espace se deplace a travers la dimension
temporelle, nous pouvons choisir l’une des possibilites infinies definies par les dimensions spatiales
supplementaires, par le biais d’un processus appele transition quantique entre les espaces. La
realite emergerait de la materialisation specifique de cette transition quantique, aboutissant a une
serie chronologique d’evenements. Cette materialisation est basee sur une propriete fondamentale
de tout espace, independamment de ses dimensions, que nous appelons inconnectivite spatiale.
Cette propriete implique l’incapacite des composants d’un espace particulier a observer des

d’observateurs, toutes les possibilites sont realisables, expliquant ainsi les proprietes quantiques

planes (or two-dimensional spaces) parallel to each other. By
its own definition, there is no possibility that two points, two
lines, or two planes can establish contact with each other, no
matter how close they are, because between them infinite
points, lines, or planes can be found, respectively. We call
this property unconnectivity between spaces. A corollary of
this property is that a dimensionless entity located within a
point cannot “comprehend” what a straight line is, because
the apposition of points along a direction is outside the
dimensionless space that constitutes that point. For the same
reason, the concept of plane is not “conceivable” for a onedimensional entity located within a line nor the concept of
three-dimensional space for a two-dimensional entity present
within a plane. To “comprehend” these particular spaces, it
would be necessary to move along another dimension. By
transferring these geometric concepts to the physical reality,
we propose that any space, independently of its number of
dimensions, is a self-contained system unable to “visualize”
what resides outside its dimensions. We emphasize this concept because, from a practical point of view, the spatial
unconnectivity makes it impossible to observe extra spatial
dimensions to those that constitute the three-dimensional
space in which we are immersed.
II. QUANTUM TRANSITION BETWEEN SPACES AND
UNCONSCIOUS BREAKDOWN OF UNCONNECTIVITY
AS THE ORIGIN OF MOVEMENT AND TIME

The displacement of a space e along the extra dimensions of another space of greater dimensionality E to become
space e’, when in doing so e acquires inherent properties
defined by the position occupied by e’ in space E, is referred
to as quantum transition between spaces. To understand this
concept, there is nothing better than an example. Suppose
the existence of a grey sphere in a specific region of a threedimensional space. If we were part of a two-dimensional
space (a plane) inserted in the mentioned three-dimensional
space, our displacement through the sphere would be
observed as the sudden appearance of a grey circle that
increases its radius until reaching that of the sphere and then
decreases until disappearing completely (Fig. 1). The quantum displacement of our two-dimensional space across the
sphere results in the appearance of time that arises from what
we call unconscious breakdown of unconnectivity. This
means that we have travelled in a quantum manner from a
two-dimensional space to other two-dimensional spaces present at different positions within the three-dimensional space
from which, a priori, we lack “conscious” access due to the
spatial unconnectivity. This transition implies the appearance
of movement, an epiphenomenon of the quantum transition
from which time arises. In the same example, if our space
had been one-dimensional (a straight line), we would have
observed the appearance of a grey segment that increases its
size to the value of the diameter of the sphere and then
decreases it until it disappears. Again, we would have undergone a time experience caused by the movement observed
within the segment. If we were entities from a dimensionless
Universe (a point), we would have observed a color change
(to grey) that lasts as long as our adimensional space crosses

time.

the grey sphere. In all cases, we could not perceive the
existence of the sphere due to the unconnectivity between
spaces, even though the inhabitants of the three-dimensional
space could observe it. In conclusion, quantum transition
between spaces leads to the unconscious breakdown of the
spatial unconnectivity, which is visualized as movement.
Time would be an epiphenomenon of this quantum
transition.
The example of the grey sphere described above allows
us to easily understand spacetime,1 the simplest multidimensional system. Einstein showed that the observable Universe
must also include a temporal dimension. In our context, this
dimension would be the basis for the quantum transition of
our three-dimensional space along time (Fig. 2). In other
words, spacetime would be constituted by infinite threedimensional spaces arranged along the time dimension, and
the transit along these spaces following the time arrow would
generate the movement we observe in our three-dimensional

FIG. 2. Time arises from the quantum displacement of our threedimensional space, here indicated as a cube, through the infinite
three-dimensional spaces arranged throughout the temporal dimension. This
four-dimensional space can be assimilated to Einstein’s spacetime.

space. Although we are unable to observe the whole fourdimensional spacetime due to the lack of connectivity
between the infinite three-dimensional spaces inserted in it,
we can intuit it by extrapolation of the grey sphere example
mentioned above.
III. FREE WILL

Spacetime is deterministic because it is fixed by the
three-dimensional spaces that are arranged along the temporal dimension, as is the case with the grey sphere. This contrasts with our daily experience, indicating that the
observable Universe is stochastic. We can make free decisions and act accordingly without more restrictions than
those imposed by Society and Culture, and these restrictions
may be overcome on multiple occasions. But then how to
explain free will?
Although the concept of “free will” cannot be used to
explain classical physical phenomena, the idea that our will
could be genuinely free even if the universe is governed by
deterministic laws is getting attention in the physics community.2 Indeed, free will is inherent to classical experimental
settings of quantum mechanics, such as the archetypal Alice
and Bob experiment.3
Therefore, free will might be intrinsically linked to the
counterintuitive phenomena described by this astonishing
branch of physics. We postulate that the quantum transitions
between spaces observed in the spacetime, giving rise to our
experience of time, can be extrapolated to a Universe with
multiple dimensions. As it travels through the temporal
dimension, our three-dimensional space could also move
through the extra dimensions of the Universe, acquiring the
properties of the three-dimensional spaces that it occupies
(Fig. 3). Therefore, all the possible histories of the Universe
would already be defined in the infinite three-dimensional
spaces inserted in a multidimensional space, and the quantum transit between them along the temporal dimension
could explain the emergence of free will. This would lead to
an appearance of free will within a deterministic Universe.
IV. HOW DOES REALITY EMERGE?

According to our model, reality would derive from the
specific properties of the spaces occupied by our threedimensional space as it travels through the temporal dimension. But what determines the quantum trajectory followed
by our space through the multidimensional space in which
we are inserted? One possibility is that the observers determine this trajectory, in accordance with the classical results
of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics states that, in the absence of an
observer, elementary particles can be present simultaneously
in multiple places according to a wave function. When these
particles are observed, the wave function collapses and the
particle occupies a specific place in space.4 This sudden
change is the basis of the famous Schr€odinger’s cat. The cat
can be alive or dead simultaneously, and we only observe its
real state when we open the box where it is contained. This
paradox is easily explained by our Universe model. In our
Universe, elementary particles, not macroscopically

FIG. 3. Simplified example of quantum transition between spaces. Each
small cube is a three-dimensional space (as in Fig. 2) that displaces through
a multidimensional space (big cube englobing small cubes), following the
time dimension (t). For simplicity, we illustrate only 5 spatial dimensions
plus the temporal dimension. x/y, x/t, and y/t projections are shown to facilitate the visualization of the quantum transition represented as the movement
of the spaces containing spheres 1, 2, and 3.

observable, maintain their full quantum potential. This
would be determined by all the possibilities embodied in the
extra spaces distributed throughout the multispatial dimensions of the Universe. When subatomic particles are
observed with sophisticated instruments, then their multiplicity of states materializes in only one of them, just the state of
the particle in the specific space occupied by the observers.
Since all macroscopic objects are observable, their quantum
potentiality disappears. This is easily explained because only
one of the infinite possible states materializes as reality due
to the interaction of the observer.
Under this model, we would perceive reality as unique
due to the lack of connectivity between spaces. The present
time would represent the emanation of the reality at a specific time point. The future would be determined by the successive quantum transitions to be developed. The past, in
contrast, would be materialized by the quantum transitions
already made. Neither the future nor the past could be visualized due to the lack of connectivity between spaces. Other
alternative presents could not be observed either.
As an extension of this interpretation, reality (with associated free will) would emanate from the interference exerted
by “all” observers present in our three-dimensional space on
the infinity of quantum possibilities of the Universe, each
derived from its multiple dimensions. There would be infinite spaces through which we can travel, and common reality
would emerge from the effect of all observers. Each of us
would generate a part of the reality contained in our local
environment. As a simile, the Universe would be like one of
those theater plays with multiple endings in which the public
decides which one of them is finally performed.

V. DISCUSSION

We have reached a similar conclusion to that of Everett
in his well-known Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum
mechanics.5 Nevertheless, while Everett’s model rests on an
a posteriori process since it states that worlds split creating
parallel Universes, our proposal is aprioristic since it postulates that all the “worlds” (i.e., three-dimensional spaces)
exist from the origin of the Universe, as also proposed by
Hall et al.6 and Sebens.7 The splitting of worlds postulated
by Everett and others (see, for instance, Deutsch8) as well as
the worlds proposed by Hall et al.6 and Sebens7 lead to a
multiplicity of histories of the Universe. Our proposal, in
contrast, states that only one of all the possible alternatives is
real, materialized by our interaction with the multidimensional space constituting the Universe, in which we all are
inserted. This multidimensional space might be assimilated
to the Superstring model, which describes the Universe as an
eleven-dimensional space.9 It would be the observation what
leads to a specific quantum trajectory through previously
existing three-dimensional spaces.
Our model reconciles quantum mechanics with relativistic physics, since Relativity is valid in each of the infinite
three-dimensional spaces present in our Universe, which
together with the temporal dimension constitute infinite
spacetimes. Each particle would occupy a specific position
in each spacetime, following the probability defined by the
Schr€
odinger equation,10 thus explaining the paradoxes of
quantum mechanics.
Our proposal solves a number of objections raised by the
Many Worlds interpretation of Everett. First, our model does
not require decoherence11 to occur. Second, our model is not
time asymmetric12 since infinite pasts and infinite futures are
equally possible. Finally, our model does not violate the law
of matter-energy conservation since all the “Everett’s
worlds” already exist in the Universe from its beginning.
A recent study13 is consistent with our model of reality.
This study tested the Wigner’s proposal that two observers
can locally experience different realities,14 in this case the
state of pairs of entangled photons. By using an extended
Wigner’s friend scenario with four observers,15 these authors
concluded that reality depends on the observer. In this experiment, the friend’s record is simulated with a type-I fusion
gate that stores the photon measure, which is obtained

37

through a nondestructive approach. Then, the external
observers measure either the photon state itself or the
friend’s record. If one considers that the fusion gate is actually a measurement device, then what this experiment demonstrates is that free will plays a prominent role in the
measurement problem of quantum mechanics. The same
photon can be differentially observed depending on the
observer’s decision to measure it with one or another device.
Under our model, this discrepancy is easily explained.
Observer’s free will results in the choice of different quantum transitions between spaces depending on the measurement device that is used, and therefore, different states from
the same photon can finally be observed.
We propose the following experiment to test our model
of reality within this experimental framework. Once the
choice of using one or another device has been made and the
measurement is already performed, our model predicts that
the observers would be in a particular space with the photon
state already defined. Therefore, the record stored in the second device should yield the same photon state, in contrast to
the authors’s observation that the first measurement using
either one or another device results in different outcomes.13
If our prediction turns out to be true, it would represent
an important support for our model, which is the easiest way
to explain how reality arises in our observed Universe.

s I write this, I am assuming
that I am making a choice to
write, figuring out what I am
writing about, choosing to think and
integrate what I know to come up with
something that might be interesting and
important enough to write about (lacking either interest or importance would
render this not worthy of my effort), and
taking the time and effort to write this.
All of this seems self-evident and, at
best, mundane (risking being not interesting or important). But all is not what
it seems.
In Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will,1 Robert M. Saplosky makes
a cogent case that, as I write this, it has
nothing to do with my free will to do so.
Instead, my every action (and yours) and
decision is not the product of my desires,
motivations, and choices. Instead, as he

quotes, “It’s turtles all the way down.”
He argues that everything that we do
arises from forces about which we have
no control. Zero. Nada. Our behaviors,
thoughts, actions, reactions, and even the
illusion of choices come from what came
before—including ancestry, culture, biology, environment, upbringing, genes,
and, of course, our brain functioning the
same as the sea snail Aplysia retracting
its mantle when touched.
How can this be? Can’t be true. My
subjective experience is living through
time, making my own choices that were
of my own choosing to get to the goals
that I chose. Not my biology. Me. I did
that. I am doing that now. I am responsible for my choices because I choose
them. And what happens to responsibility if everything we do is determined
by forces out of our control? Sapolsky
gives an example of the changes in society’s attitude about epilepsy. It used
to be thought that the person with epi-

lepsy was bewitched and responsible for
it, prompting what we now think of as
barbaric punishment, including death.
Sapolsky provides all the arguments that
you can think of that would refute his
hypothesis and then demolishes them
one by one. For example, free will as an
emergent property of neurobiology arising out of chaotic processes? Nonsense.
And yet, if Sapolsky is right, how does
one live one’s life if everything we do is
predetermined by so many factors outside of our control?
Sapolosky is fully convinced that we
have no free will. But he confesses that
he lives as if he does. Perhaps all of us
do and it’s a lot of fun (and disturbing) to think about our free will (or lack
thereof ).

Abstract: The aquaculture production sector is one of the suppliers of global food consumption
needs. Countries that have a large amount of water contribute to the needs of aquaculture production,
especially the freshwater fisheries sector. Indonesia is a country that has a large number of large
bodies of water and is the top-five producer of aquaculture production. Technology and engineering
continue to be developed to improve the quality and quantity of aquaculture production. One aspect
that can be observed is how the condition of fish pond water is healthy and supports fish growth.
Various studies have been conducted related to the aquaculture monitoring system, but the problem
is how effective it is in terms of accuracy of the resulting output, implementation, and costs. In
this research, data fusion (DF) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) were implemented in an
aquaculture monitoring system with temperature, turbidity, and pH parameters to produce valid and
accurate output. The stage begins with testing sensor accuracy as part of sensor quality validation,
then integrating sensors with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) so they can be accessed in real time.
The implemented DF is divided into three layers: first, the signal layer consists of WSNs and their
components. Second, the feature layer consists of DRL combined with deep learning (DL). Third, the
decision layer determines the output of the condition of the fish pond in “normal” or “not normal”
conditions. The analysis and testing of this system look at several factors, i.e., (1) the accuracy of the
performance of the sensors used; (2) the performance of the models implemented; (3) the comparison
of DF-DRL-based systems with rule-based algorithm systems; and (4) the cost effectiveness compared
to labor costs. Of these four factors, the DF-DRL-based aquaculture monitoring system has a higher
percentage value and is a low-cost alternative for an accurate aquaculture monitoring system.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a fish-producing country which is ranked in the top five in the world.
Based on data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), it is stated that production in the aquaculture
sector will reach 14 million tons in 2022 [1]. The potential for increased production from the
aquaculture sector will contribute to improving the economy in Indonesia, where in 2022
Indonesia will become an exporter of fish with an achievement of 1.2 million tons [2]. The
main issues in aquaculture, especially freshwater aquaculture, are temperature conditions,
pH levels, dissolved oxygen levels, and turbidity levels of pond water. This influences
optimal fish growth and increases the productivity of fish yields. Aquaculture technology
integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed, such as a water monitoring
system [3], smart aquaculture system [4], AI IoT-based buoy system [5], temperature
water control [6], and others. The IoT system being built is a multi-sensor integration that
reads data from the environment and then processes it into a control application, such

as a microcontroller that drives actuators [7]. From this system model, there are several
weaknesses, including the resulting data that is only a trigger to carry out commands on
the actuator, the information for users is less decisive, and the lack of utilization of the
usability of data to make it valuable.
Data fusion is a new paradigm for integrating multi-sensor devices to produce decisive
and reliable information. Data fusion is a data processing method to improve the accuracy
and quality of the resulting output and reduce data redundancy [8]. The data generated by
sensors in a multi-sensor system are coordinated by data fusion through a special algorithm
to provide quality output [9]. Alam et al. [10] stated that the stages in data fusion consist
of four stages, i.e., signal level, pixel level, feature level, and decision level. Furthermore,
there are two perspectives regarding data fusion related to IoT: the first is a single-hub data
fusion system where sensors interact with only one fusion system. Second is the multi-hub
data fusion sensor, where the multi-sensor system interacts first with the multi-hub sensor,
and then the data are transferred to the fusion system via the multi-hub sensor. Mouli [11]
systematically describes the stages of data fusion, which begin with reading data from the
sensor, signal processing, transferring data to the PC console, feature extraction, fusion
technique, and condition analysis/diagnosis. Methods in data fusion are categorized into
four categories: statistical method, mechanistic method, data-driven method (that has subcategories of Ensemble, Fuzzy Association, and AI), assessment method, and evaluation
of metrics in the analysis of the quality [12]. In aquaculture, IoT through wireless sensor
networks (WSNs) integrate data fusion to maximize accuracy in estimating the temperature
in aquaculture ponds and minimize data redundancy through ISOA-SELM modeling [13].
Meanwhile, Rupok et al. [14] developed a fishery early monitoring system with WSNs
combined with data fusion; the method applied is the Dempster–Shafer theory (DST),
which produces an accuracy of 91.1%.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the recommended method in data fusion so
that it has intelligent system capabilities that can learn continuously [15]. The ability of
agents in DRL to interact with the environment can support the achievement of longterm goals without external motivation or complete knowledge of the environment [16].
DRL is the development of reinforcement learning (RL) combined with deep learning,
which uses a neural network that works as an approximator function and determines
the output, the policy, the action, and the value. Meanwhile, RL focuses on agents who
interact with the environment based on perceiving the state [17]. In the field of aquaculture,
Nicolas [18] employed deep reinforcement learning in fishery management regarding
decision-making by comparing several algorithms. From the results of a comparative
analysis of processing times for the nine algorithms, the TD3 algorithm has demonstrated
the highest performance results.
In the related work, there are several studies related to the fusion technique, including
Leal-Junior et al. [19] who implement a polymer optical fiber (POF) sensor to estimate
the water content of temperature-insensitive emulsions of oil–water. The surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) principle is combined with POF to produce optimal output. The SPR
POF output in the form of temperature is translated into a linear wavelength shift through
analysis of temperature cross-sensitivity as the basis for data fusion performances. The
mean error results with the fusion technique are 6.46 to 7.81%. Abadi et al. [20] employ data
fusion for downscaling and evaluation of the process of evapotranspiration in water balance
estimation. The data are in the form of remotely sensed data, and the fusion technique used
is random forest regression (RFR) and support vector machine (SVR). Model testing was
carried out by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) value. The results of the MAE
RFR and SVR tests were obtained, respectively: 6.13% and 5.71%. Manoharan et al. [21]
employed a fuzzy interface algorithm in a data fusion technique for superfluous pipeline
channel detection. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect superfluous water in five scenarios
with regard to the leakage point, time period of computation, period of upstream and
downstream velocity, sensor performance, and cost of implementation. The final results
show that the implemented data fusion model can be an alternative pattern recognition

2. System Architecture Design
This section describes the system architecture design, which contains an explanation
of the aquaculture monitoring system, wireless sensor networks, deep fusion in the aquaculture monitoring system, deep reinforcement learning that uses deep learning as an
agent, and integration of data fusion and deep reinforcement learning in the aquaculture
monitoring system.
2.1. Conventional Aquaculture Monitoring System
The aquaculture monitoring system in previous studies [26,27] was built with a sensor
device that detects the condition of the fish pond with various parameters: temperature
condition, pH level, and turbidity level. Data are read through sensors, namely the temperature sensor (type RTD PT100), pH sensor (SEN 0161), and turbidity sensor (SEN 0189),
and then sent to the microcontroller connected to the Wi-Fi module. In a conventional
aquaculture monitoring system, there are three layers: the physical layer, the network layer,
and the application layer. The physical layer consists of sensors that are connected to a
microcontroller to process data that is read by sensors from the environment. The network
layer consists of Wi-Fi modules connected to internet services. The Wi-Fi module functions
as an intermediary between the controller and the user via internet services. Meanwhile, the
application layer is a user interface that represents the data generated by reading the device
in real time from the fish pond. The applications contained in the application layer are
Android-based mobile applications, which can be accessed by users anytime and anywhere.
In this monitoring system, the user can only find out the current condition of the fish pond
based on the parameters of temperature, pH, and turbidity. In contrast, the proposed
aquaculture monitoring system not only reads the real-time condition of fish ponds but
also determines whether the current condition of fish ponds is “normal” or5“not

2.2. Wireless Sensor Networks in Aquaculture Monitoring System
WSNs read the basic conditions of fish ponds through temperature, pH, and turbidity
with integrated temperature sensor (RTD PT100), pH sensor (SEN 0161), and turbidity
sensor (SEN 0189) components that are received by the ATmega328-type microcontroller
provided by Arduino Uno R3, then connected to the internet and accessible by the user.
The selection of sensors used in this study considers three aspects, i.e., low cost, precision,
and convenience. The goal of this study is to construct a convenient, accurate, and low-cost
aquaculture monitoring system based on data fusion through deep reinforcement learning.
The microcontroller, as part of it, has an important role in processing data generated from
sensors to become the basis for determining decision parameters.
Figure 4 shows a more detailed architecture, which gives an idea of how WSNs are
implemented. The data that have been processed by the microcontroller are then connected
to the Wi-Fi module to be stored in the Firebase data cloud. The connection mechanism
used is message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT), which connects communications
between IoT machines or devices—in this case, sensors, microcontrollers, and Wi-Fi module
devices—with the cloud gateway in Firebase. Furthermore, the data are stored in Firebase
as real-time data on the current condition of the fish pond. MQTT works as a broker that
receives data from IoT devices as a client that publishes data on the temperature, pH, and
turbidity of fish ponds. MQTT is sending data to the Firebase data cloud as a subscriber
of MQTT [28]. The end user or mobile applications use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) as a protocol that communicates data in real time on Firebase to be received by

The WSN’s network topology in this study is a mesh topology, where all nodes are
interconnected or have multiple nodes. The mesh topology has the advantage in that the
connected nodes complement each other’s data; for example, if the pH sensor does not
work, then the data will be provided by other pH sensors connected to the WSN network.
The n-th node in Figure 5 shows that as many nodes can be interconnected into this mesh
topology as we need [29]. The considerations in this study using a mesh topology are the
aspects of scalability, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and the effectiveness of energy.
2.3. Data Fusion in Aquaculture Monitoring System
In this study, data fusion is implemented to integrate various sensors from a multi-sensor
system. The system data fusion architecture is represented in Figure 6, which consists of
three levels: (1) signal level; (2) feature level; (3) decision level. At the signal level, the
resulting signal output based on sensor readings is integrated for use in the next layer,
where the sensor reads the condition of the fish pond with the parameter’s temperature,
pH, and turbidity. The raw data that are read by the sensors that are integrated with the
microcontroller are then processed and transferred via the WSN as a data control for further
processing, which is transmitted to the feature level. The feature level is the second process,
which is the process of extracting data generated at the signal level to produce features
used as parameters in making decisions or actions to be carried out by the system. A fusion
technique is involved in the inferencing process in this study which uses DRL as a fusion

the resulting signal output based on sensor readings is integrated for use in the next layer,
where the sensor reads the condition of the fish pond with the parameter’s temperature,

microcontroller are then processed and transferred via the WSN as a data control for further processing, which is transmitted to the feature level. The feature level is the second
process, which is the process of extracting data generated at the signal level to produce
features used as parameters in making decisions or actions to be carried out by the system.
A fusion technique is involved in the inferencing process in this study which uses DRL as
a fusion technique for data processing. Technically, the DRL mechanism used in the fusion

is denoted as A: normal, which then triggers the system to give a reward (R) to become
the next condition Rt+1 and St+1 . The action determined by the agent is combined with the
neural network process through the function y = f (w1 x1 + w2 x2 + . . . + wn xn + b) where w
is the weight resulting from the model, x is the input from the neuron, and b is the bias. An
activation function is implemented to produce optimal output which is represented by f.
The following formulation is used in Equation (1):
Agent (St, At ) = Rt+1 + f (w1 x1 + w2 x2 + w3 x3 + . . . + wn xn + b)

(1)

As explained in the Introduction section, the agent that is built is a model-based agent,
which monitors the model of its environment when it is operated. The model becomes the
basis for agents to predict future actions and conditions. This model contains various states
and potential actions, as well as consequences or rewards that will be obtained by agents
in the DRL sequence. The selection of a model-based agent is based on environmental
conditions, that is, the parameters or states contained in the aquaculture monitoring system,
which consist of temperature, turbidity, and pH. Therefore, this allows the agent to make
the correct and accurate decisions based on environmental conditions and the state read
from the environment.
2.5. Deep Learning (DL)

DL is a tool to sharpen the action produced by the agent, with random probability
conditions [33]. In previous research, in the context of DRL, many used traditional supervised learning models such as SVM or random forest [34–36], thus the use of DL in this
study is still relevant in the context of the updated method being implemented. The DL
implementation in this study uses an artificial neural network (ANN), which is defined
by five layers, consisting of one layer as the input layer, three layers as hidden layers, and 10 of 27
Electronics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW
one layer as the output layer. DL, together with the agent, accepts the state conditions, and
then DL performs an algorithmic process to determine the probability of these conditions,
where the input conditions are divided into three parts, namely temperature conditions, pH
conditions,and

16 neurons. Meanwhile, in the output layer, there is one layer in the form of binary classification 0 and 1, which represents “normal” or “not normal” fish pond water conditions.
The input into each neuron is called a vector x = (x1, x2, x3, ... xn), and the output of the
neuron is represented by y. In input processing, each neuron requires not only the input
x but also the weight (w) that contributes to producing a strong output and provides the

which represents “normal” or “not normal” fish pond water conditions. The input into each
neuron is called a vector x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , ... xn ), and the output of the neuron is represented
by y. In input processing, each neuron requires not only the input x but also the weight (w)
that contributes to producing a strong output and provides the direction of the connection
to the next neuron. To carry out x and w processing, an activation function (f ) is needed so
that it produces a non-linear output that will be transferred to the next neurons [37]. In the
formulation Equation (2), output neurons are represented by y, which consists of f, which
is an activation function that processes inputs w1 x1 , w2 x2 , w3 x3 , to wn xn and added by b,
which is a representation of the bias [38].
y = f (w1 x1 + w2 x2 + w3 x3 + . . . + wn xn + b)

(2)

In this study, the activation function formulation used is sigmoid because it has
compatibility with the resulting output in the form of binary classification in the form of 0
and 1 which represent “normal” and “not normal” output conditions. Sigmoid is denoted
by the formula in Equation (3), as follows:
f (x) = 1/(1 + e(−x) )

(3)

x denotes input data in the function, while e denotes a constant value that has a value
of 2.71828 [39]. As previously described, the sigmoid is suitable for binary classification
cases, where the value range of the sigmoid activation function is from 0 to 1 [40]. This
is due to the way the sigmoid activation function works: various input values become a
probability value of 0 to 1. For example, if the output value is greater than 0.5, then the
probability will lead to a value of 1, where in this case the value 1 is defined as a “not
normal” condition, while if the output value is less than 0.5, then the probability will lead
to 0, which is defined as a “normal” condition. Graphical visualization of the sigmoid
activation function is represented in Figure 10:

2.6. Combined Data Fusion and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework

The goal of this study is to combine DF with DRL, in which there is DL to assist agents
in determining the actions to be taken. Inside the DF, there is a signal layer that provides
state conditions (S) to the feature layer as a DRL trigger to determine what action (A)
is performed by the agent. Data processing is done by DL through a neural network
consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The output layer instructs
a reward (R) for the next iteration process, and A is forwarded to the decision layer which
translates A as a “normal” or “not normal” condition of data processing. The next layer is
the application layer where data are represented in a user interface that can be used by end
users. Figure 11 shows a combined DF and DRL visualization:

carried out. The initial process is carried out by validating sensor accuracy to ensure that
the temperature, pH, and turbidity sensor components work properly in order to produce
accurate and valid data. The validation process is carried out by testing the sensor in
several conditions in the fish pond. The process of collecting test data is carried out with a
range of time from morning to evening with eight timeframes beginning from 06.00 am
to 08.00 pm. The results of the test are then compared with the measurement results from
the measuring instrument, then a gap is sought between the sensor measurement results
and the measuring instrument which shows the measurement error range. In this study,
the error tolerance given in testing is a maximum of 5% or a minimum of 95% accuracy. If
the conditions are not met, then the process will be repeated until it reaches a maximum
error of 5%. The system built is a WSN, where the data after being read by the sensor
is then transferred to the Firebase real-time cloud which will later be used as the basic
parameters for the system to process data. The process of data communication between
sensor devices and Firebase is carried out via the message queuing telemetry transport
(MQTT) protocol so that data can be transmitted to Firebase to become real-time data. The
transferred data in the form of temperature, pH, and turbidity parameters are processed by
the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) system through deep learning to produce an action
as the output of the agent. In the next stage, the system interprets the data into a binary
classification to output 1 or 0. In this stage, DRL implementation is carried out, where the
agent provides output based on deep learning modeling that has been embedded in the
system. Then, the system performs the decision layer by translating the binary classification
into “normal” or “not normal” conditions, where in this study output 0 is defined as a

Further explanation in Figure 12 relating to the validation of the sensor accuracy, WSNs,
modeling of deep learning, and deep learning reinforcement algorithms are explained in
detail as follows:
3.1. Validating the Sensor Accuracy
In validating the accuracy of the sensor, it is done by collecting data on the condition
of the fish pond which is divided into eight sampling times in the morning, afternoon, and
evening with a range of every two hours starting at 06.00 to 20.00 (08.00 pm). At the time of
data collection, the environmental conditions were cloudy with occasional light rain, and
the air temperature ranged from 25 ◦ C to 30 ◦ C. Table 1 shows a detailed description of the
test data collection, which is divided into eight timeframes:

3.2. The Implementation of WSNs
As described in the previous section, the WSNs in this study integrate sensors to be
able to communicate with Firebase cloud data. The process of transmitting sensor data
through WSNs is carried out with the pseudocode as shown in Table 2 to indicate cite
Table 2:

END

The implementation of WSNs for transmitting data from sensors to the cloud can be
seen in Table 3, where there is real-time data on the results of environment readings on the
pH, temperature, and turbidity parameters.

classification feature consisting of “normal” and “not normal” labels. The three feature
parameters are states, which will later become knowledge for agents in deep reinforcement
learning to understand actual environmental conditions so that the agent can decide which
action to take under various conditions and at random. As a parameter reference, Table 4
shows the range of normal conditions of the fish pond environment:

The classification label refers to the parameter conditions in Table 4. For conditions
outside of these parameters, the classification label becomes “not normal.” The number of
dataset records used in modeling is 1000, consisting of 500 dataset records with a “normal”
classification label and 500 dataset records with a “not normal” classification label. Table 5
shows the sample dataset used in the study regarding the “normal” class referred to in
Table 4. For example, in ID 1, where the temperature is 27, the turbidity is 15, and the pH is
8, these conditions correspond to the parameter range in Table 4 as “normal” conditions. In
contrast, in ID 3, it was found that the temperature was 20, and since it is not included in the
parameter range of Table 4, the condition is included in the “not normal” class. Likewise,
for ID 7, the value of the temperature is 10, turbidity is 30, and pH is 10. Referring to
Table 4, the temperature does not enter “normal” conditions, which are in the range of
25–30 ◦ C, and the pH also does not enter “normal” conditions, which is in the pH range
of 6–9. Thus, ID 7 enters the “not normal” classification. In the “class” column in ID 3

Electronics 2023, 12, 2032

and ID 7, both have class conditions of “not normal”, but come from different parameter
conditions, where in ID 3, temperature (t1) does not meet “normal” conditions, while in
ID 7, temperature (t1) and pH (ph) do not meet “normal” conditions. To facilitate modeling,
a classification label is transformed into binary, where “normal” conditions are represented
by 0, while “not normal” conditions are represented by 1. The class after transformation is
shown in column 6 in gray in Table 5:

The sample data are sufficient for the deep learning algorithm used in the study
because the data have gone through the process of data preparation and transformation so
that the algorithm has well-balanced data and has no significant noise, especially in this
case, which is a binary classification (the condition of the fish pond water is “normal” or
“not normal”) also using three clear input parameters i.e., turbidity, pH, and temperature.
As described in the previous section, the architecture model uses a deep neural network
consisting of five layers. The hidden layer consists of layers, with each neuron having
32 neurons, 16 neurons, and 16 neurons. Furthermore, for the modeling process, dataset
training is carried out by dividing the dataset into train data of 80% of the total dataset and
test data of 20%. The learning rate used in modeling is 0.01 because this value is generally
widely used in various frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow; it also has a balanced
value in the sense that it is neither too small nor too big. Specifically, the parameters used
in the training model are listed in Table 6 below:

Visually, data exploration from modeling can be seen in Figure 15, where data values
0 and 1 are shown in yellow and green, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that the
data are divided into two groups, but there are anomalous data that are indicated by red
and orange colors.
From the results of the model training, an evaluation of the model is carried out using
accuracy and the F1 score. There are several outputs generated by modeling: true positive
(TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). Table 7 shows the
confusion matrix showing TP, TN, FP, and FN:

In Table 15, the actual value is shown by the “expected value” column, which is the
reference for the condition of the fish pond. In the DF-DRL column, out of the 20 scenario
conditions tested, there is one condition (which is indicated with red font) that does
not match the expected value, so that the total value that corresponds is 19 conditions.
Furthermore, the cause of this anomaly condition occurs because it is predicted due to two
factors: first, the temperature and turbidity level are almost close to the threshold, so the
model is confused about whether the condition is “normal” or “not normal”, and second,
the MAPE tolerance on the sensor is 3.8% so that the sensor reading when testing the
DF-DRL is close to the condition “not normal” and the system detects the condition as “not
normal”. Then, from the 19 true conditions, divide by the number of 20 scenarios to produce
95% accuracy. Meanwhile, in the rule-based algorithm column, there are 17 conditions that
have appropriate values and 3 conditions that do not match; this case can also be caused by
the condition values that are close to the threshold. Therefore, the rule-based algorithm
produces a percentage accuracy of 85%; a brief comparison of the two methods is shown in
Table 16:

4.4. Analysis of DF-DRL Implemented in Aquaculture Monitoring System
The implementation of DF-DRL in the aquaculture monitoring system has a significant
impact on fish cultivators and provides efficiency and ease in managing low-cost aquaculture. The analysis was carried out by comparing the aquaculture monitoring system
based on DF-DRL technology with the labor force. Calculations are made by looking at
conditions in Indonesia, where electricity costs are charged at IDR 1352 per kWh, or IDR
1.352 per Wh. The maximum power usage for the DF-DRL device is 20 watts with daily
use for 24 h. Meanwhile, the daily labor force fee is IDR 50,000 with duration of 3 to 5 h.
Table 17 shows a comparative analysis of the cost burden between DF-DRL technology and
the labor force in the aquaculture monitoring system.

In Table 17, it can be seen that there is a significant comparison between DF-DRL
technology and labor costs in the aquaculture monitoring system. In the daily cost column,
the use of DF-DRL for 24 h is IDR 648.960; if accumulated within 1 month (30 days) it will
result in a cost of IDR 19,468.8. Meanwhile, the labor cost for a month is IDR 1,500,000.
Maintenance costs are an additional parameter for DF-DRL technology of IDR 50,000.
Consequently, the total cost incurred each month for DF-DRL technology is IDR 69,468.8
or USD 4.63 per month. Meanwhile, the total labor cost is IDR 1,500,000 or USD 100
per month. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the implementation of DF-DRL
technology in aquaculture monitoring systems provides low-cost benefits and added value
for fish cultivators.
5. Conclusions
DF-DRL technology in the aquaculture monitoring system provides efficiency in the
accuracy of the data generated by the system and the reliability of data that can be accessed

in real time. The stage is carried out by testing the quality of sensor accuracy on WSNs,
where it is obtained with an average error in MAPE of 3.80% or an accuracy of 96.2%.
From the aspect of deep learning modeling, a comparative analysis has been carried out
with traditional machine learning consisting of a support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest
neighbor (kNN), and naïve Bayes classifier (NBC), with an average accuracy of 94.31%,
while the results of deep learning modeling accuracy implemented in this study are 96.30%.
Meanwhile, the effectiveness of DF-DRL performance with a rule-based algorithm with
testing of 20 scenarios resulted in 95% and 85% accuracy, respectively. DF-DRL technology
has 10% higher performance than rule-based algorithms.
While the DF-DRL analysis in terms of cost effectiveness is compared to labor cost
through the monthly cost parameter, it is found that DF-DRL technology is far superior
to labor cost, which is USD 4.63 for DF-DRL technology and USD 100 for labor cost in
monthly cost. DF-DRL technology is an alternative in a low-cost aquaculture monitoring
system with technology that produces significant data accuracy and validity. In future
development, the system can be integrated with various sensors, such as hungry fish
detectors, monitoring cameras integrated with image processing, actuators that provide
automatic feeding, and various other sensors and actuators that are adaptive to various
environmental conditions.

Abstract: Quantum uncertainty has a tremendous explanatory power. Coherent superposition,
quantum equations of motion, entanglement, nonlocal correlations, dynamical nonlocality, contextuality,
discord, counterfactual protocols, weak measurements, quantization itself, and even preservation of
causality can be traced back to quantum uncertainty. We revisit and extend our previous works, as
well as some other works of the community, in order to account for the above claims. Special emphasis
is given to the connection between uncertainty and nonlocality, two notions which evolved quite
independently and may seem distinct but, in fact, are tightly related. Indeterminism, or more precisely,
locally consistent indeterminism, should be understood as the enabler of most quantum phenomena
(and possibly all of them).
Keywords: quantum mechanics; uncertainty; indeterminism; quantum nonlocality; entanglement;
contextuality

1. Introduction
Classical mechanics and classical field theories (including electromagnetism) are deterministic. Full
specification of the initial conditions allows, in principle, the determination of the state of the system at
any later moment. It is also possible to sharply measure all the physical variables of the system at will.
Quantum indeterminism may, therefore, appear as a severe limitation of quantum mechanics. Perhaps
we would have liked to know simultaneously all physical variables of a microscopic quantum system,
but alas we cannot. Is that a curse? No, it is actually a blessing. As ironically indicated by George
Orwell, “ignorance is strength”, or at least it is in quantum mechanics.
How is this so? That is exactly the question we wish to answer here, based on a substantial
amount of evidence provided in our previous works and in the works of additional authors.
Before we do that, we need to define better what we mean by indeterminism. We would like to have
an empirical notion which is not bounded to a specific theoretical model. Following Ref. [1], we shall
henceforth ascribe the property of indeterminism to any system having at least two physical variables
which cannot be jointly measured with absolute precision. In other words, within our framework
indeterminism amounts to the existence of random variables A0 , A1 and a non-zero complex number
r, such that ∆2A1 ∆2A0 ≥ |r|2 . The variance ∆2A = E[ A2i ] − E[ Ai ]2 can be measured in a sequence
i
of experiments, given that the average converges to the expected value (denoted here by E). In the
following, it will be constructive to encode the above inequality in a positive semi-definiteness condition:

In quantum mechanics, the physical variables Ai correspond to Hermitian operators Âi , the
expected value becomes the quantum expectation value which can be theoretically calculated using
the wavefunction, and so on, but the above definition is a general one. Moreover, Equation (1)
straightforwardly entails known uncertainty relations within quantum mechanics: choosing
r = h[ Â0 , Â1 ]i/2 (i.e., half of the commutator) leads to the Robertson uncertainty relation ∆2Â ∆2Â ≥

|h[ Â0 , Â1 ]i|2 /4, while choosing r = h Â1 Â0 i − h Â1 ih Â0 i (i.e., the covariance) leads to the Schrödinger

The former choice of r is the reason we will identify below quantum uncertainty with non-zero
commutation relations, while later we will use the latter choice to connect more generally the notion of
uncertainty (or indeterminism) with local correlations (and often we would divide the covariance by
the product of standard deviations resulting in the Pearson correlation coefficient).
It should be noted that, here, we chose what we believe to be the simplest notion of uncertainty in
quantum mechanics and more general theories, i.e., a bound on the product of variances, but other
inequalities exist involving the sum of the variances [2–4] or the entropy (entropic uncertainty
relations) [5–12].
In what follows, we will begin with simple, yet deep, manifestations of quantum uncertainty,
and then we shall discuss more recent ones, including a few novel implications of uncertainty for
various quantum phenomena, and mainly nonlocality [13–16]. The latter results may be found in
Section 4.
2. Immediate Observations
A quantum particle goes through a double slit. At first, the inability to retrieve both which-path
information and interference may seem glooming, but in fact the uncertain position of the particle
within the double slit is utterly necessary for observing later the interference pattern. Coherent
superposition and all its fundamental consequences, like the wave-particle duality [17], as well as
its practical consequences, e.g., quantum key distribution [18,19] and quantum computation [20,21],
result from uncertainty. For instance, the Hadamard gate H1 , so valuable in quantum computation,
is meaningful because it does not commute with the projectors |0ih0| and |1ih1| on the computational
basis elements. Delayed choice [22] or eraser variants thereof [23–25] similarly depend on the uncertainty
for reviving the which-path information.
The above relation between interference and uncertainty has clearly motivated the treatment of
quantum particles as waves, which is familiar from the Schrödinger picture, but was also shown to
take place within the particle-based, operator-oriented Heisenberg picture [26–28].
Obviously, the Heisenberg equation for the time evolution of an operator A, i.e.,
i

depends on the commutator of A and the Hamiltonain H. The commutator, in return, determines
the extent of uncertainty via, e.g., the Schrödinger-Robertson uncertainty relations, along with the
anti-commutator.
Similarly, the von Neumann equation
∂

(4)

crucially involves the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the density matrix ρ. The same is true
of course for the dynamics of open quantum systems, relativistic particles and fields, etc., in which
equations of motion, too, depend on non-trivial commutation relations.

Still within the Heisenberg picture, qualitative uncertainty relations were shown in Ref. [28]
to prevent nonlocal equations of motion of modular operators from violating causality. We have
demonstrated that the dynamics of quantum operators is markedly different from the classical dynamics
of their classical counterpart in that certain quantities depend on potentials acting elsewhere. That
could have led to violations of causality, but quantum uncertainty was able to mask this effect [28].
In addition to coherent superposition and quantum equations of motion, uncertainty relations
are also responsible for quantization (see, e.g., Ref. [29]). It is customary to begin the quantization of
the classical harmonic oscillator with the quantum commutation relation [ a, a† ] = 1 of the creation
and annihilation operators resulting from the canonical commutation relation [ x, p] = ih̄ between the
position and momentum operators. The latter commutation relation is arguably the most fundamental
difference between classical and quantum mechanics. And indeed, the same methodology carries over
to the quantization of fields, most notably the electromagnetic ones. Hence, the algebraic structure of
quantum mechanics depending on the commutator, rather than the Poisson bracket, makes it utterly
different. For a more thorough mathematical analysis see [30]. Despite the above, we note the smooth
transition between quantum and classical mechanics through the group contraction h̄ → 0.
3. Additional Observations
In many cases, uncertainty acts as a sea to which little droplets can be poured without being
noticed [31,32]. This, for example, is the case with weak measurements [33]: A pointer is coupled to the
system of interest in order to measure it. If the coupling is weak enough, or short enough in duration,
so that the eventual shift of the pointer is much smaller than its uncertainty, then the measurement can
be considered weak. Uncertainty can also mask the dependency of the weak value of any operator
hφ| A|ψi
A, i.e., Aw = hφ|ψi , on the postselected state |φi, even when the weak value is anomalous [34–39]
(i.e., lying outside the spectrum of A). This shielding of the future boundary condition is crucial of
course for preventing causality violations.
This idea of “asymmetric” interaction (in terms of the involved uncertainties) is captured by
“quantum oblivion” [31], where one particle seems to contain a record of a past interaction with another
particle which remains oblivious of that. Quantum oblivion was shown to underlie interaction-free
measurement [40], the quantum Zeno effect [41], the Aharonov-Bohm effect [42], and other quantum
peculiarities.
We have also shown that, in the case of quantum hidden variables, lack of knowledge prevents
them from signaling in time [43]; hence, they must remain unknown. Here, too, it was clear that full
knowledge is not a bliss; better if certain physical variables remain hidden forever [44].
Although less obvious, the spin-statistics theorem can be also derived solely based on commutation
and anti-commutation relations [45].
We shall now turn to the main topic of this paper, namely examining more closely the relations
between nonlocality and uncertainty even beyond quantum mechanics. However, we hope that the
above concise examples have helped clarifying the more general depth and significance of uncertainty
in quantum mechanics.
4. Uncertainty and Nonlocality: A Quantum Intimacy
In the 1980s, Shimony [46,47] and Aharonov [48] conjectured independently that quantum
mechanics is as nonlocal as it is, without violating causality, thanks to the existence of uncertainty
(Aharonov further claimed that uncertainty relations are vital for preserving temporal causality (see,
e.g., [49,50])). Recently, we rigorously quantified this claim [1], with related approaches reported
in Reference [51–55]. Some of the important features of our approach are: (1) A completely general
framework, external to the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics, relying only on a well
defined statistics of empirical outcomes. (2) The Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relations is found
as a special case. (3) Not only the Tsirelson bound is found but also the Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes
(TLM) bound [56–58], as well as new, hitherto unnoticed bounds. (4) It has already proved useful in
deriving new outcomes [59–61].

Rather than the general construction outlined in Ref. [1], we wish to begin with an interesting
relation between uncertainty and nonlocality within the Hilbert space structure. For this purpose, let us
examine the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) scenario with Alice measuring
either A0 or A1 and Bob measuring either B0 and B1 (all variables are assumed to take ±1 values).
In quantum mechanics, the above variables are described as operators, and we may define the CHSH
operator as S = A0 B0 + A0 B1 + A1 B0 − A1 B1 . The variance of this operator must be non-negative, i.e.,
hS2 i ≥ hSi2 . In other words:
|hSi| ≤

q

4 + 2h A0 B0 A1 B0 − A0 B1 A1 B1 + A0 B0 A0 B1 − A1 B0 A1 B1 + A0 B0 A1 B1 − A0 B1 A1 B0 i.

(5)

This can be seen as a generalized Tsirelson bound. In quantum mechanics, the A operator commute
with the B operators; hence, the first two differences are zero, and we are left with the following
tighter-than-Tsirelson bound including only the last pair of expectation values:
|h A0 B0 i + h A0 B1 i + h A1 B0 i − h A1 B1 i| ≤

q

4 + 2(h A0 B0 A1 B1 i − h A0 B1 A1 B0 i).

(6)

From this inequality, we easily deduce that stronger-than-classical correlations are possible only
when B0 and B1 do not commute. Maximal violation of the CHSH inequality corresponds to a maximal
difference between h A0 B0 A1 B1 i and h A0 B1 A1 B0 i, i.e., maximal uncertainty on Bob’s side (and the same
claims are true of course for Alice’s operators A0 and A1 ). But there is another lesson to be learned here:
The commutativity of Alice’s and Bob’s operator was the one countering the potentiality of reaching
stronger-than-quantum correlations implied by Equation (5). Hence, local commutation relations
discriminate classical from quantum correlations and nonlocal commutation relations discriminate
quantum from strong-than-quantum correlations. This perfectly accords with the conclusions of [1,55].
It should be noted that the difference between A0 B0 A1 B1 and A0 B1 A1 B0 also lies at the heart of
the Peres-Mermin magic square [62,63]. In that case, we see a discrepancy between σ1x σ2y σ1y σ2x and
σ1x σ2x σ1y σ2y . Nonlocality and contextuality, therefore, agree on the difference between products of some
operators, but nonlocality is richer in that it also requires equality between other products of operators.
This equality was shown in [1,55] to be crucial. For us, it stands for a subtle form of relativistic causality.
Importantly, the above reasoning does not depend on the Hilbert space structure. We have
proposed in [1] a way to generalize this necessary locality of uncertainty relations in a way which
would be applicable to any well-defined statistical theory. Below we revisit this approach.
4.1. Nonlocality and Uncertainty in General
Nonlocal correlations are fundamentally bounded by the parties’ uncertainty relations. This fact
was shown to be a characteristic of any physical theory where nonlocal correlations are consistent with
relativistic causality [1]. As an example, consider again the Bell-CHSH scenario. The Hilbert-space
structure of quantum mechanics affords a statistical covariance matrix for the Alice-Bob observables,
a generalization of the covariance matrix from probability theory. The quantum covariance matrix of
A0 , A1 , and Bj is expressed as
h B2j i − h Bj i2

C ( A0 , A1 , Bj ) = h A0 ⊗ Bj i − h A0 ih Bj i
h A1 ⊗ Bj i − h A1 ih Bj i


(7)

which is a self-adjoint positive semi-definite matrix . It is sometimes convenient to normalize the rows
and columns of C ( A0 , A1 , Bj ) by the respective standard deviations of Ai and Bj so as to obtain the
quantum analog of a correlation matrix,


by the Schur complement condition for positive semi-definiteness. The correlation matrix on the left,
Corr( A0 , A1 ), is the 2 × 2 lower submatrix in Corr( A0 , A1 , Bj ). Its non-negativity is equivalent to the
Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, which follows from the non-negativity of its determinant,
1 − |$( A0 , A1 )|2 ≥ 0. Here, however, it may be recognized that Alice’s uncertainty relations become
tighter due to the presence of Bob – the (matrix) lower bound on Corr( A0 , A1 ) is no longer zero.
Alternatively, the above matrix inequality can be viewed as Alice’s local bound (Corr( A0 , A1 )) on the
nonlocal Alice-Bob correlations ($( Ai ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ Bj )). Clearly, the roles of Alice and Bob can be switched
to get a similar bound on nonlocal correlations, this time with Bob’s local uncertainty relations,
Corr( B0 , B1 ).
We have shown in Ref. [1] that similar matrix inequalities lead to known, as well as new,
characterizations of the set of bipartite quantum correlations. Apart from the well-known Tsirelson’s
bound, other characterizations may involve nonlinear functions of the underlying correlations. To get
a more intuitive expression relating the Bell-CHSH parameter and the local uncertainties of Alice
and Bob, let us assume the correlations are isotropic, $( Ai ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ Bj ) = (−1)ij c, for some c ∈ [−1, 1].
The Bell-CHSH parameter in this case is, S = ∑i,j∈{0,1} (−1)ij $( Ai ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ Bj ) = 4c. Plugging these
correlations into the matrix inequality above reads
"

which is equivalent to the non-negativity of the determinant of the matrix obtained by subtracting the
right side from the left side above,
2c2 + |$( A0 , A1 )|2 − (−1) j c2 ($( A0 , A1 ) + $( A1 , A0 )) ≤ 1.

(12)

Adding together the inequalities for j = 0, 1 and recalling that c = S/4 leads to

(14)

These show that quantum nonlocality, as measured by the Bell-CHSH parameter, is bounded by
Alice’s and Bob’s local uncertainties, as quantified by determinants of √
the respective (local) correlation
matrices. It can also be noticed that Tsirelson’s bound in that case, the 2 2, is attained for the maximum
uncertainty on both sides, when det (Corr( A0 , A1 )) = det (Corr( B0 , B1 )) = 1.
Similar relations apply to multiple-input-multiple-output, multipartite scenarios [1,55]. Moreover,
this approach can be extended through the use of “complex correlations” to non-Hermitian, signaling
operators [60] and to continuous variables [61]. Finally, our approach has given rise to multiplicative
Bell inequalities and their Tsirelson bounds [59], as well as several other results currently underway.
For some related (and very interesting) analyses see [51,53,54].

Entropy 2020, 22, 302

In all these cases, we have seen that, although uncertainty relations enable correlations beyond
quantum mechanics, local consistency (i.e., the independence of uncertainty relations and local
correlations on the choices of remote parties) constrains the nonlocal correlations to lie within the
boundaries of quantum mechanics.
4.2. Uncertainty as an Axiom
Violations of Bell inequalities are experimental fact and hence make part of the predictions of
any physical theory which may someday replace quantum mechanics. On the other hand, violations
of relativistic causality have never been witnessed and are believed to lead to grievous paradoxes.
Nevertheless, taking nonlocality as one of the axioms of a physical theory and relativistic causality
as the other has proved futile in characterizing the set of quantum correlations—relativistic causality
does not limit the strength of nonlocality whatsoever [64]. Partial characterizations of this set have
been derived using reasonable, though not always physical, arguments [51,65–72].
However, it was recently shown that, once uncertainty relations, broadly understood, are taken as
a starting point, relativistic causality, manifested by the locality of uncertainty relations, completely
characterizes the set of quantum correlations in a bipartite binary measurement setting [1]. Uncertainty
relations in the sense used here refer to the existence of an empirical covariance matrix, which is far less
than assuming the Hilbert-space structure of quantum mechanics. Such a covariance may be written
for any number of experimenters, with any number of measurement devices, and for both discrete and
continuous variables. Further assuming locality of uncertainty relations—that experimenters cannot
tamper with the uncertainty relations of their peers—restricts the set of nonlocal correlations.
4.3. Uncertainty, Randomness, and Nonlocality
The amount of nonlocality present in a multipartite quantum mechanical system is related both
to the local uncertainty relations and to the predictability of measurement outcomes. For ±1-valued
observables, A and B, we may take h Ai and h Bi as indicators of the randomness inherent to Alice’s
and Bob’s measurements—both expected values vanish for completely random outcomes. Assume
for simplicity that the expected values of Alice/Bob observables are the same. We can now prove the
following bound on the Bell-CHSH parameter,

q

B1 )|, with the larger providing a tighter bound. This shows
where η equals either |$( A0 , A1 )| or |$( B0 , p
that both quantities, the local uncertainty 1 − η 2 , and measurement predictability, as quantified by
the right-hand side term in the square root, dictate the amount of nonlocality. We have previously
shown [55] that this relation can be alternatively quantified via the Tsallis entropy [73] of parameter
q = 1/2. Moreover, the above relation between local and nonlocal correlations, as well as the
aforementioned ones, can be tested in the lab using sequential weak measurements [74] performed on
each of the photons within a Bell test setup (also see [55,60]).
It is worth noting that other manifestations of quantum nonlocality, such as discord [75–77] and
reactivity [78], are known to depend on local uncertainty relations [78–80].
5. Discussion
We have briefly discussed the immense explanatory power of local uncertainty relations in
quantum mechanics, especially the quantitative characterization of quantum nonlocality. We leave the
following as open questions:
1.
2.
3.

Does any local uncertainty relation (including, e.g., entropic uncertainty relations) correspond to
a meaningful bound on nonlocal correlations?
Is there a finite pathway for deriving tight bounds on quantum correlations?
How would dynamical nonlocality seem in theories beyond quantum mechanics?

Are there quantum phenomena which cannot be traced back to quantum uncertainty?
Are uncertainty and causality the fundamental axioms to begin with (similarly to our analysis in
Ref. [1]), or is there a conceptually superior set of axioms?

Abstract: The idea of agent causation—that a system such as a living organism can be a cause of
things in the world—is often seen as mysterious and deemed to be at odds with the physicalist
thesis that is now commonly embraced in science and philosophy. Instead, the causal power of
organisms is attributed to mechanistic components within the system or derived from the causal
activity at the lowest level of physical description. In either case, the ‘agent’ itself (i.e., the system
as a whole) is left out of the picture entirely, and agent causation is explained away. We argue
that this is not the right way to think about causation in biology or in systems more generally. We
present a framework of eight criteria that we argue, collectively, describe a system that overcomes the
challenges concerning agent causality in an entirely naturalistic and non-mysterious way. They are:
(1) thermodynamic autonomy, (2) persistence, (3) endogenous activity, (4) holistic integration, (5) lowlevel indeterminacy, (6) multiple realisability, (7) historicity, (8) agent-level normativity. Each criterion
is taken to be dimensional rather than categorical, and thus we conclude with a short discussion on
how researchers working on quantifying agency may use this multidimensional framework to situate
and guide their research.

1. Introduction

doi.org/10.3390/e24040472

When an organism acts in the world, is it right to say that the organism caused the
effect? Or is that simply a useful metaphor or a convenient level of description? Perhaps
the more accurate statement is that some biochemical pathway or neural activity within
the organism caused the effect. In other words, is it right to think of organisms as agents
capable of action? Or are they simply loci of complicated happenings that give the illusion
of concerted, autonomous agency? Are there things that happen in the world that are
rightly said to be “up to” organisms, things that they do as agents, or are such happenings,
in fact, reducible to the physical evolution of the components that constitute the organism?
These are the questions posed by the concept of agent causality.
Introduced by Thomas Reid in 1863, “agent causation” is the claim that agents themselves can be the cause of events [1]. That is, organisms or systems as a whole can have
causal power that is not entirely reducible to the causal power of their component parts
or determined by the states of the environment [2–5]. Therefore, it mirrors a much older
concept, framed by Aristotle and Epicurus in the context of human beings, of some things
being “up to us”.
To justify agent causation, then, systems need to exhibit a causal power that irreducibly
inheres at the level of the whole system (i.e., it is nonreductive) while still maintaining
that the causal power is instantiated in, or realised by, the system’s physical constituents
(i.e., it obeys physicalism). Timothy O’Connor describes this as an “ontologically primitive
causal power” that is “at once causally dependent on microphysically-based structural
states and yet ontologically primitive” [5] (p. 195)—where ‘primitive’ refers to this notion
of irreducibility, rather than its meaning in evolutionary terms. For many philosophers,

this is logically incoherent, and so agent causation is deemed to be conceptually and
metaphysically impossible or at least highly problematic [6–8]. To see why, one needs to
consider a number of different but overlapping ontological and methodological arguments
that each appears to refute the concept from slightly different angles.
The first is the idea of vertical reductionism and the associated causal fundamentalism
that typically comes with it. Vertical reductionism is the idea that for every macroscale
description of a phenomenon, there is a microscale description that fixes it. In philosophy,
this is often referred to as a supervenience relation: the macroscale supervenes on the
microscale if a change in the microscale is necessary for a change in the macroscale to
occur. Consider, for example, the relation between an individual molecule and the atoms
that underlie or fix it. The properties of the molecule do not change without change at
the atomic scale. If the microscale fixes the macroscale, then there is a sense in which the
macroscale can always be derived from, or explained in terms of, the microscale. That is,
any larger scale description of a phenomenon can be reduced to a description that uses
smaller scales.
The logical endpoint of this vertical reductionism is that everything is describable in
terms of the smallest possible physical elements in the universe—quantum fields, perhaps—
and the interactions between them. This poses a threat to agent causation because the
natural instinct is to infer that, because everything at a larger scale of description, including
agents, is derivable from the properties of and interactions between quantum fields, what
causal work is there left to do at the macroscale? Or as philosopher Jaegwon Kim puts it:
“If an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M as
a cause of any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining
why any alleged effect of M occurred?” [7] (p. 558).
If all causation is fixed by microphysical happenings, then agents must be epiphenomenal. There is simply no room in the universe for macroscale phenomena to have the kind
of ‘irreducible’ causal power needed for agent causation [6,9,10].
The second challenge to agent causation comes from what we could call horizontal
reductionism. Here, the threat to agent causation stems from claims that it is not the system,
as a whole, that has causal power. Instead, causation is attributed to a specific subset
of components within the system—it is a particular ‘part’ (or set of parts) that causally
determines the action of the ‘whole’. Thus, the whole does not have any causal power in
virtue of being a whole because causation is entirely localised to (a set of) components with
smaller spatial and temporal dimensions than the whole.
The important difference between vertical reductionism and horizontal reductionism,
then, is that, in the former, the macro- vs. micro-distinction (what is being reduced to what)
is between scales of description. However, crucially, at whatever scale you are using, the
description is always of the entire system, that is, pitched at the spatiotemporal dimensions
of the whole. Whereas, in horizontal reductionism, the macro- vs. micro- distinction refers
to what is being described. The important causal elements in the system are reduced
to a subsystem, or set of parts, that is spatiotemporally smaller than the system itself.
Importantly, this can be carried out using any description scale. For instance, if the system
in question is a brain, you could describe it in terms of all the atoms that constitute the brain
and then causally reduce that to a localised subset of those atoms, or you could describe
the brain in terms of its neuronal connectome and then causally reduce that to a localised
subset of neural states.
The traditional alternative to agent causation, event causation, is one form of horizontal
reductionism. It claims that an organism’s actions are caused by states and events that
simply involve the organism [11,12]. Event-causalists tend to cite a particular psychological
state (e.g., a belief) as the sufficient cause of a given action, with these states, themselves,
having previously been caused by antecedent states or events. By horizontally reducing the
locus of causality to events and states inside the organism, this view leaves the ‘agent’ out of
the picture entirely. Agents are not identical with a particular belief or desire or goal, so if
these psychological states wholly determine the system’s behaviour, then there is no sense

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

in which the ‘agent’ can be said to have caused its effects in the world. This is sometimes
referred to as the ‘problem of the disappearing agent’ [3,13,14].
Eliminative materialism goes one step further than event causation, claiming that certain
psychological states such as beliefs and desires do not exist and, thus, we should only appeal
to neuroscientific explanations when identifying the cause of an organism’s action [15,16].
This position is, therefore, both vertically and horizontally reductive; in that it (vertically)
reduces psychological states to neural states and (horizontally) reduces the whole system
to a subset of neural states within the system. One issue worth noting is that it is not clear
why eliminative materialism does not lead to the causal fundamentalism that typically
comes with embracing vertical reductionism. In other words, what makes neural states the
right scale of description at which to identify causation? If a reduction from psychological
states to neural states is permissible, why not reduce further to a causal explanation at
the scale of cellular components, electrical ions, or the subatomic particles and quantum
fields that compose those neural states? As we have seen, once the door to vertical (causal)
reductionism is opened, it is hard to see how one could resist the fundamentalist pull to
only identify causation at the smallest scale of physical description.
The third and final threat to agent causation is from external determinism. If systems
are determinately ‘pushed around’ by states and events in the environment, then to what
extent can the system be meaningfully considered the cause of its actions? Instead, agents
need to be causally autonomous from their environment, in that they have “the ability to do
what one does independently, without being forced to do so by some outside power” [17]
(p. 305). In this sense, external determinism parallels, and, in fact, overlaps with, the
horizontal reductionist challenge to agent causation, since both threaten to ‘explain away’
the agent by localising causal power to somewhere that is not the system as a whole. In
horizontal reductionism, it is events and states within the system that wholly determine
the system’s actions. In external determinism, it is events and states in the environment
that wholly determine the system’s actions.
These three lines of argument, vertical reductionism, horizontal reductionism, and
external determinism, appear to underlie the general consensus among philosophers that
agent causation is not tenable. Our primary goal in this paper is to demystify and revive
the concept of agent causation by presenting a set of conditions that, in principle, would
enable a theoretical system to overcome all three of those arguments if met. In other words,
our aim is to propose a set of general criteria that may collectively justify ascribing agent
causation to a system of study. These are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

Thermodynamic autonomy;
Persistence;
Endogenous activity;
Holistic integration;
Low-Level indeterminacy;
Multiple realisability;
Historicity;
Agent-Level normativity.

Our intention is not necessarily to argue that these criteria are complete and definitive
but rather to demonstrate a plausible way in which agent causality can be conceptualised
and realised in systems without violating the thesis of physicalism. In doing so, the
secondary aim of this paper is to investigate and argue that living systems satisfy at least
some of these conditions. Note that we do not consider the criteria as bright lines but
rather as dimensions along which different organisms may vary. Moreover, though we
highlight each condition separately for the purposes of this paper, they do, in fact, overlap
and co-depend to quite a considerable degree. While each is a necessary condition in its
own right, the full sense in which the eight criteria may justify agent causation comes from
understanding how they fit together as a collective.
We should also note that we take agent causation to be necessary but not sufficient
for ‘free will’. The criteria presented here are intended to provide a naturalised account

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

of how a system may exhibit agent causation, but we do not assume that such a system
would necessarily have free will (where the former is loosely understood as ‘doing what
you want’ or ‘acting for your own reasons’, while the latter also includes the meta-capacity
to ‘want what you want’ or ‘reason about your own reasons’ [18]).
In short, we hope to (i) convince readers that agent causality is a plausible and
appropriate way to think about causation in biological systems, and (ii) set out a conceptual
framework for a more productive and empirically grounded investigation into the concept
of agency within biology.
2. Criteria for Agent Causation
2.1. Thermodynamic Autonomy
One presumably uncontroversial condition for agent causality is that the system in
question is thermodynamically distinct from its environment (known, technically, as being
out of equilibrium with the environment). Indeed, this is necessary to be an organism or an
entity at all—let alone be an agent or a cause of events in the world. Systems, first, have to
be an identifiable thing, with a physical boundary that legitimately separates them from
the rest of the universe [19–21]. As Keith Farnsworth explains:
“If there were no physical boundary between an agent and its surroundings,
then any external force would act unaltered throughout the agent, and any force
initiated by the agent would act equally on the internal and external environment,
so no distinction in action could be made between the agent and its surroundings.
If no distinction can be made, then no measurement could be made to tell us
whether an action arose from within or beyond the agent” [22] (p. 12).
Living systems achieve this separation from the environment via a cell membrane or
an outer skin in more complex organisms. These physical barriers define the system as an
entity, with a discernible inside and an outside, and, at the same time, enable the system
to do work to remain out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the environment. The
physical barrier also grants the organism a degree of causal insulation from the external
milieu. Instead of being exposed to every flow of physical and chemical causation that
comes its way, the system is sheltered from that storm and able to buffer its internal
dynamics. This is a crucial first step toward agent causation because it means that
events in the environment are not determinately pushing the system around. External
forces may impinge on the system without leading to a change in its behavior; thus,
creating space for other (agent-level) factors to have a causal influence. In this sense,
a physical barrier lays the groundwork for systems to overcome the threat posed by
external determinism (see Section 2.3).
Moreover, the system’s barrier opens up the possibility of a new form of causation,
dependent on information. Rather than letting (potentially noxious) chemicals from the
environment into the system, specialised receptor molecules can sit in (e.g.,) a cell’s membrane. These receptors have both external and internal components, such that when the
external end binds a chemical, it causes the entire molecule to change its conformation,
which, in turn, can impact the dynamics inside the cell. No matter or energy passes through
the barrier. Rather, the receptor transmits a signal that carries information about something out in the environment, namely, the presence of chemical X. The information is
what causally impacts the system’s internal processes and—as we explore below—this
new form of informational causation can be heavily influenced by the current state of the
cell (see Sections 2.3 and 2.4) and its historicity (see Section 2.7); such that the behaviour
of the system is not wholly explainable in terms of environmental causes alone (contra
external determinism), nor wholly understandable in terms of sublocalisable, instantaneous
physical states (contra horizontal and vertical reductionism). Thus, the requirement for
agents to be thermodynamically autonomous systems sets the foundation upon which
most, if not all, of the other agent causation criteria, are built.

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

2.2. Persistence
Another straightforward and foundational requirement for agenthood is that the system in question persists through time. While the duration necessary to satisfy this condition
is an open (and probably unproductive) question, at least some degree of persistence is
needed in order to be around long enough to cause an effect. Moreover, as we will discuss
in Sections 2.7 and 2.8, persistence on phylogenetic and ontogenetic timescales are both
required for systems to exhibit the type of temporally extended causation that, we argue, is
needed to overcome the threat of eliminative materialism.
Living systems clearly satisfy the condition of persistence. Indeed, life is often characterised as the ability to (locally) resist the second law of thermodynamics and survive for
extended periods of time [19]. Unlike rocks which persist passively, due simply to physical
hardness and chemical inertness (i.e., through stasis and inertia), biological persistence
is dynamic in nature. Organisms obtain stability out of a constant internal flux of recursive chemical reactions and self-sustaining causal loops, where component parts do work
to constrain one another within the bounds necessary to keep the whole system going.
Living organisms thus persist as dynamic, holistic patterns that constantly regenerate the
constraints required to keep themselves organised [23–26]
There are two important consequences of the organism’s method of persistence. First,
the system needs the energy to fuel the self-sustaining cycles of constraints. Organisms
must therefore remain open to the environment in a controlled way, locating food and
converting it into energy that can be used to maintain the ongoing internal dynamics.
Second, life is a pattern. What persists through time is the organisational pattern of selfmaintaining, dynamical processes, not the physical material that realises that pattern at any
one moment. In fact, the atoms that constitute the system are regularly being replaced, yet
the dynamical pattern persists, and we take this to be the organism persisting.
This property immediately undermines horizontal reductionism since it is not clear
how one could isolate causation to a subset of specific elements within the pattern when
holistic integration is the system’s defining characteristic (see Section 2.4).
2.3. Endogenous Activity
Non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems that persist through time can stand apart
from the physical world long enough to be a causal factor in it. However, to justify agent
causality and meaningfully be labelled the cause of their effects, systems also need to
sidestep the challenge of external determinism. Their actions cannot simply be determined
by events in the environment, such that one could predict the behaviour of the system from
external states alone. In other words, agents need to have some degree of causal autonomy
from the outside world.
As we saw in Section 2.1, a physical barrier is a good start: it insulates the system
from external perturbations so that not every change in the environment causes a change
in the system. However, it does not follow from this that every change in the system
is not caused by a change in the environment. Thus, a physical barrier is not sufficient
for causal autonomy since it is still the case that the forces that do causally impact the
behaviour of the system could do so in a deterministic, linear fashion (as suggested by
external determinism).
We propose that a condition for agent causality is not just persistence but active
persistence. Systems need to internally initiate their actions, to some degree, so as to
avoid being mere stimulus-response machines that are passively pushed around by the
environment. In this way, external factors can influence but not determinately cause the
system’s behaviour in a manner that would be incompatible with agent-level causation
(due to external determinism).
As we outlined in Section 2.2, a defining feature of living organisms is their dynamic,
internal activity. They are constantly doing thermodynamic work internally to self-organise
and maintain the pattern of processes that define their existence. To this end, organisms are
better understood as actively monitoring and adjusting to information about conditions in

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

6 of 18

the environment rather than being pushed around by these conditions. External inputs are
assimilated into ongoing patterns of biochemical and/or neural activity rather than driving
that activity itself.
Evidence of this sort of endogenous activity comes from all areas of biology. Central
pattern generators [27], for example, which spontaneously generate rhythmic oscillatory
patterns in the brain, are found in almost all vertebrates and invertebrates and play
an important causal role in organism-level behaviours such as walking, swimming,
and flying [28]. In humans, our internal activity in the absence of external stimuli is
abundantly clear whenever we introspect or sit alone with our thoughts. This has been
shown experimentally through reports of visual hallucination in sensory-deprivation
contexts [29–31]. The brain’s constant activity is also evident in brain-imaging studies:
fMRI research showed that task-specific neural activity typically amounts to just 1–2%
of background brain activity in relevant areas and, thus, energy-consumption at rest
is almost the same as during a demanding task [32] (see [33] for a full overview of the
brain as an endogenously active organ).
Taken together, this evidence presents a clear picture of organisms as endogenously
active systems. Even when they appear from the outside to be at rest, they are not static
internally [34]. They are constantly doing work to readjust their internal configuration so
as to keep the whole dynamic, self-maintaining process alive and persisting. This equips
the system with a degree of causal autonomy from the environment: external stimuli
can influence the system’s behaviour, but only within the context of its current internal
dynamics. That is, the system’s actions in the world are ultimately generated from within,
with information from the environment used to guide these dynamics as needed [35].
Another point to note here is that the information that organisms receive from their
environments is very rarely sufficient for them to unambiguously determine an appropriate
course of action. Often, external inputs are simply not rich enough for external determinism
to hold. Instead, organisms actively probe the environment, gathering information, making
inferences about what is out in the world, and trying out new problem-solving techniques.
Thereby providing clear instances of endogenous action that is not determinately driven
from the outside [36]. In this sense, even perception might be understood as a form of
internally initiated action [37].
Therefore, living systems provide a model for conceptualising how systems, in general,
can overcome the challenge posed by external determinism and, thus, move us one step
closer to agent causality. In the rest of this paper, we will consider how a system might
overcome the reductionist threat, starting with horizontal reductionism in the next section.
2.4. Holistic Integration
The horizontal reductionist challenge to agent causation paints a picture of systems
as machine-like, made up of isolatable mechanisms, each of which performs its own
specialised function, which are then combined in a serial, linear, additive fashion to create
the system (or cause it to come into being). This sort of explanation is “analogous to a recipe
for producing a phenomenon starting from a list of ingredients, where the ingredients are
mechanistic entities and their properties, and the recipe amounts to the organization and
sequence of activities these entities perform” [38] (p. 105). This perspective leads to the
‘agent’ being left out of any causal explanation for its own behaviour because, for any given
action, there is an identifiable mechanism, or linear cause-effect pathway, within the system
that can be pointed to as the cause of that action. Thus, while the system may have escaped
being deterministically pushed around by external events, it is now being deterministically
pushed around by some of its own component parts instead. There is no room left for a
causal power that inheres at the level of the whole system (i.e., agent-level causation).
However, we contend that not all systems can be coherently decomposed into separable parts in this machine-like manner. As we saw above, living organisms are dynamic,
holistically integrated systems whose parts constantly act in concert, influencing and constraining one another in order to maintain the holistic pattern. Even the simplest organisms

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

7 of 18

show substantial degrees of integration. For example, bacterial chemotaxis, when a bacterium locomotes up or down a chemical gradient in its environment, is one of the simplest
and most well-studied behaviours in biology. There exists a well-understood pathway
in the bacterium that links a transmembrane receptor for detecting food substances, via
an internal signal transduction cascade, to a flagellum that controls its motion [39]. The
temptation is thus to explain bacterial chemotaxis in terms of a simple linear chain of
fully determining causes and effects, starting with the detection of a chemical stimulus
and then sequentially moving through each part of the chemotactic pathway until a locomotion behaviour is performed. However, the apparent discreteness and linearity of
this pathway, as suggested by highly controlled (and thus, highly artificial) experiments,
is somewhat illusory. In fact, contextual information about the current metabolic state of
the cell constantly integrates with and modulates the chemotactic pathway [40] in a way
that is highly nonlinear and that challenges any suggestion that the pathway determinately
causes chemotaxis. If changes in the metabolic state of the cell can change how the action
is executed, despite the same individual stimulus being present, then it does not seem
accurate to isolate the chemotactic pathway and identify it as the cause of the action. Such
an interpretation only arises when one holds the metabolic state of the cell constant while
studying how bacterial chemotaxis works. As we have seen, this would afford only a partial
understanding of the mechanism because it misses the system’s holistically integrated and
relational structure, as well as the endogenous activity of the system.
Bacteria can also integrate a number of different environmental cues simultaneously,
including pH levels, temperature, and osmolarity, and use information from the past to
inform and influence action [41]. It was even shown in E. coli that crosstalk between one
signaling pathway (heat shock) could modulate the activity of a significantly different
pathway (respiration) [42,43]. Moreover, the direction of bacterial chemotaxis itself relies on
temporal integration. The bacterium does not act based on absolute levels, but according
to information it gathers about concentration changes as it moves. The resultant picture
is one in which, even in this very simple organism, “sensory, regulatory, and metabolic
networks must all drive environmental perception and corresponding action” in a strikingly
holistic and integrated fashion [44] (p. 364). The argument that the bacterium’s behaviour
is determined by any identifiable ‘part’ or even an isolatable pathway is thus difficult to
maintain when the whole organism is clearly involved in the regulation and execution of
this behaviour.
We see increasing degrees of holistic design as we scale up to more complex organisms
with brains and nervous systems. Fuelled by recent technological advances that allow
researchers to record neural activity on a much larger scale than ever before, we are
now learning that brain areas we once understood as single-mindedly carrying out their
work in relative isolation are, in fact, highly sensitive to the activity in other brain areas.
Visual cortex activity, for example, as well as processing visual information, is substantially
modulated by an organism’s movements; with evidence coming from running and hindlimb
flexions, all the way down to small orofacial movements and pupil dilations [45–47].
Indeed, information about actions, goals, diverse sensory percepts, internal states, and
other parameters is much more widely distributed than previously thought, meaning that
all local signaling is modulated by the context of global brain states [48,49].
Similarly, the brain regions, circuits, and processes that mediate decision-making
and action selection are highly distributed, involving ongoing signaling between multiple
subsystems across the brain, working in parallel in recursive, interlocking cycles over some
duration of time [48,50–52]. The result is a dynamic, system-wide interaction, in which
parts are continuously modulating and constraining each other until they all collectively
settle into a new state. To decompose this process into a set of functionally independent
(machine-like) ‘parts’ carrying out their work in isolation, and then combining to cause the
system’s next state, is to entirely miss the essentially dynamic and holistic nature of it.
Therefore, the evidence suggests that biological systems are too holistic, too integrated,
and too relational to submit to a machine-like analysis. Instead, they are more akin to

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

8 of 18

Stuart Kauffman’s concept of a ‘Kantian Whole’ (which, as the name suggests, derives
from the work of Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgement). Kauffman depicts a system
in which “the parts exist for and by means of the whole, and the whole exists for and
by means of the parts” [53] (p. 609). That is, a system so deeply interconnected that it
does not make sense to decompose it into its component parts because the true essence of
the system exists in the relations between those parts [54]. In this sense, organisms offer
us a way to conceptualise a system that does not fall prey to the horizontal reductionist
challenge. If a system is so holistically integrated that to understand any given part, you
must also understand the whole, then causal power will meaningfully inhere at the level of
the whole. You cannot horizontally reduce such a system to identify a particular part (or
set of parts) that is determining the system’s next state because the activity of that part is,
itself, determined by all the other parts in the whole. Therefore, we suggest that holistic
integration is a necessary condition for agent causality.
In the final section of this paper, we consider where the instinct towards horizontal
reductive thinking comes from in the practice of science and philosophy. Below, we explore
the properties of organisms that argue against vertical reductionism.
2.5. Low-Level Indeterminacy
If the arguments above deflate horizontal reductionist claims, it could still perhaps be
argued that the real causation inheres at the lowest level, in the physical interactions of the
components, even if they have to be considered as a single, unified dynamical system (no
matter how complex those interactions might be). Under this vertically reductionist view,
the state of the entire physical system at time t (which may need to include the state of its
environment), plus the low-level laws of physics, fully determine the state of the system
at some subsequent time, t + 1. Logically, this would extend to t + 2, t + 3 . . . t + n, and
on to infinity. This Laplacian view (of complete determinism from the dawn to the end of
time) is encompassed in Kim’s argument that ‘every physical effect has a sufficient physical
cause’, with the implication that those causes are necessarily located at the lowest levels
(or smallest scales of description) [6,55]. This argument thus asserts both physical predeterminism and causal reductionism. If the laws determining the interactions of particles
or the evolution of quantum fields are causally comprehensive, then no higher-order causes
can be admitted.
However, the evolution of quantum fields is not fully predetermined in this way.
Though the Schrödinger equation gives a definite solution for how quantum fields comprising any system will evolve, this solution is a distribution of probabilities [56]. As soon as
some interaction occurs of the type necessary to actually observe the state of the system
(but not actually relying on an observer, per se), some particular set of these probabilities
will be realised. What determines what set becomes realised (within the probability parameters as defined) seems to be truly random—unpredictable in principle, not just in practice,
consistent with the Heisenberg Uncertainty (or Indeterminacy) Principle. Though there are
very different interpretations of what this means for the underlying nature of reality [56],
the upshot is that the totally defined microscopic state of a complete system, together with
the fundamental equations that comprehensively describe the evolution of quantum fields,
as an empirical fact, do not deterministically predict the next state of the system [57,58].
This thereby brings into doubt the causal fundamentalist urge to identify all causal power
at the system’s lowest level of description.
This fundamental indeterminacy is, therefore, a necessary but not sufficient condition
for the emergence of some kind of higher-order causation [4,59,60]. Many physical systems
will evolve simply according to the partly random realisation of these underlying probabilities. However, others may come to be structured in such a way that constrains their
evolution according to some kind of higher-order, functional criteria. This is exactly what
happens in living organisms, due, in the first instance, to the iterative, ratchet-like action of
natural selection and, second, to the ongoing learning that individual organisms engage in
over their lifetimes. Both of these processes select for structures that physically embody

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

9 of 18

criteria for action (see Section 2.6), enabling organisms to accumulate causal power and act
in ways that promote their own persistence (see Section 2.7).
This goal-directedness of living organisms means that higher-order states can have
meaning and value (normativity) for the organism (see (Section 2.8). The system can
be configured in such a way that it represents and operates on information—physical
states that are about something and which inform the actions of the agent. This kind of
informational causation thus enables agents to do things for reasons. However, if this view
is to be defended, the causation must depend on the meaning of higher-order patterns,
which, though it must be realised in some low-level state at any moment, cannot be reduced
to low-level details. Here, the concept of multiple realisability is crucial.
2.6. Multiple Realisability
A key feature of agency is doing things for reasons. The lowest-level details of a system,
e.g., the neurons in a brain or the atoms and molecules that constitute them, do not have
reasons; certainly not reasons for system-level action, at least. Therefore, a system cannot
justify agent causality if it is being entirely driven around by the constituents at its lowest
level of description. Instead, higher levels need to have some degree of causal autonomy
from the lowest-level parts, such that changes at the lowest level do not necessarily cause
changes at the higher level in a simple feedforward or bottom-up fashion. This is a crucial
step toward agent causality because it means that at least some of the system’s causal
power must inhere at the higher levels of organisation, where it might start to make sense
to talk about agent-level reasons.
The structuring of criteria in living organisms, which determine the flow of information and interpretation of different patterns of activity, embodies exactly this kind of
higher-order causation [61]. This is particularly elaborated in neural signaling, where
communication from one neuron to another, or one population of neurons to another,
depends on distinct macroscopic patterns, which each can be instantiated or realised in
many different microscopic arrangements (i.e., multiple realisability).
Take the communication between neurons, for example. Neuron A receives inputs
from Neuron B via neurotransmitter molecules that are released when B fires. These
molecules can be bound by neurotransmitter receptors on Neuron A, which open, allowing
sodium ions to rush into the post-synaptic structure. This generates a change in the electrical
potential gradient between the inside and the outside of the cell. However, this charge is
rapidly buffered unless the total increase over some short time period pushes the potential
above a threshold, which triggers an explosive amplifying event—the action potential or
firing of the neuron, transmitting an electrical signal to the other neurons it has synaptic
connections with (also known as a spike). If the threshold is not reached, the neuron will
not fire, and the electrical potential will peter out, in effect wiping any record of neuron B’s
original spike.
Neuron communication is, therefore, generally not designed to be a faithful or exact
transmission of information but rather an interpretation of it. Some spikes will be completely ignored and for those that are not, details such as the timing of a spike are still often
ignored, i.e., the specific details of exactly when the spike occurred simply do not matter
(outside of some specialised systems such as auditory neurons). Instead, neuron A is only
interested in whether the number of spikes that come its way within a given time frame
is sufficient to satisfy its threshold, or, as neuroscientist Peter Tse frames it, sufficient to
meet the criteria neuron A places on its inputs [61]. The process is thus highly nonlinear;
in particular, many changes in the input do not lead to changes in the output. Individual
neurons are configured so that they monitor their inputs in different ways; some act as temporal filters, waiting for strong bursts of inputs over a limited time window before firing,
others act as coincidence detectors, where near-synchronous spikes from multiple input
neurons are needed to meet their conditions for action. The low-level details thus often
do not matter, and they are often lost in this coarse-graining process. As a consequence,
two patterns of input spikes with different arrangements may effectively prompt the same

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

10 of 18

activity in the downstream neuron. In effect, they mean the same thing to that neuron, and
it is the meaning of the pattern that has causal efficacy.
The same principle applies at the level of populations of neurons [62,63]. Because of the
network of excitatory and inhibitory connections among any local population of neurons,
the possible patterns of activity that groups of neurons can exhibit is constrained [63–65].
Neuronal populations within a brain region consequently tend to occupy a particular set
of patterns, or ‘attractor states’, far more often than any of the other patterns they could
conceivably occupy. This means that the potentially high-dimensional state space that the
population could occupy is constrained to a much lower-dimensional manifold. Brains
are shown to capitalise on the occurrence of these population-level attractor states to, once
again, use higher-order information to drive the system, rather than rely on the low-level
details (in this case, the states of the individual neurons). A given population can exhibit
a number of neural modes or subspaces of the possible multidimensional activity space,
only a subset of which may be efficacious in driving activity in downstream areas [66].
Perhaps a more helpful way to frame this relationship is that the second population of
neurons is configured to monitor activity in the first region and selectively activate when
certain patterns appear while effectively ignoring others [67]. A different downstream
population may only activate when it detects a different set of patterns, depending on what
information it is “interested in”.
These functional criteria can be prewired by evolution or crafted through learning. In
either case, they are aligned to the goals of the organism, better enabling the organism to
do the causal work required for its own persistence. Moreover, they can also be modulated
on the fly by processes of attention or top-down selection, realised through rapid synaptic
reweighting [61]. The functional criteria that direct each neuron’s or each population’s
interpretation of any given inputs are thus not fixed or isolatable but depend holistically
on global context (thus, also contra horizontal reductionism).
Multiple realisability of this sort undermines claims that the causality really rests in the
details of the lower level. The vertically reductive argument is that even if some low-level
pattern becomes coarse-grained in transfer to the next neuron or population, since the
macrostate must, at any moment, or over some defined duration, be instantiated in some
particular microstate or sequence of microstates (i.e., it supervenes on the microstates), then
any particular microstate will necessarily fix the macrostate. Therefore, the causality that
we had attributed to the macrostate A (under the relationship: if A, then X) could really
be completely inherent in the corresponding microstate, A0 , which would also entail X.
However, there is a reciprocal relationship that is usually implied in this kind of causal
relationship. If A is supposed to be the cause of X, then it is usually understood that the
counterfactual NOT A would imply NOT X.
Under multiple realisability, that counterfactual applies to the macrostate but not
necessarily to every microstate. If the microstate is changed from A0 to B0 , corresponding to
macrostate B, rather than A, then you may obtain a different outcome, Y. However, if the
microstate is changed from A0 to A00 or A000 , all of which still corresponds to macrostate
A, then you would not see a change in the outcome; X would still occur. The effect, X, is
therefore ‘sensitive’ to the multiply-realisable macrostate, A, rather than the microstate that
physically realises it (i.e., A0 , A00 or A000 ) [68]. The causal information, under this kind of
counterfactual reasoning, is thus rightly said to inhere at the level of the macrostate, i.e., in
the higher-order pattern, rather than the low-level details.
Taken together, low-level indeterminacy and multiple realisability appear to bypass
the vertical (causal) reductionist challenge to agent causality. Low-level indeterminacy
shows that the lowest level of description is not deterministically fixing the next state of any
system, while multiple realisability represents a way in which some systems can capitalise
on this indeterminacy in order to exert a form of higher-order causation. In the sections
below, we argue that these multiply-realisable, higher-order patterns have causal efficacy
in the brain by virtue of what they mean for the organism. This provides a framework for
naturalising reasons in systems more generally.

2.7. Historicity
Above, we described how low-level indeterminacy creates some causal slack in the
system that can enable the emergence of non-reductive (or higher-order) causation. But
does this actually get us any closer to agent causation? Even though it is higher-order
patterns of information that push the system around and not the lowest-level physical
happenings, it is still not obvious how the causal power in the system could sensibly be
understood in terms of agent-level reasons. Is the whole not still being ‘pushed around’ by
its parts? It is just being carried out by patterns of neural activity now. In this case, there is
still no sense that the ‘agent’ is causing its effects in the world.
To bring the agent into the picture, we need to reflect on our framework for understanding causation in contemporary science. Mostly, we limit our causal explanations to
‘how’ questions: we ask ‘how did X cause Y?’ Scientists then try to get to grips with the
mechanisms that underwrite X’s behaviour, and we explain the causal relation between X
and Y in those terms. However, an equally valid question to ask is: ‘why does X behave in
that way?’ [69]. In the case of rocks or atoms or billiard balls, this is a somewhat uninteresting and unenlightening question, with the answer simply being the physical characteristics
of the entity in question. However, in systems that run on information, it is a very fruitful
line of questioning, precisely because these systems exhibit higher-order causation.
Consider, again, the neural population. An activation pattern among the neurons
in this population is only causally efficacious (within the system) if there is a receiver or
interpreter monitoring the population and activating in some way when the pattern appears [67]. That is, the pattern is only informational if there is something that is sufficiently
configured to notice it. Therefore, it is relevant to ask why the interpreter is set up to detect
the particular pattern it does (and subsequently activate in the way that it does) if we are
to obtain a full causal understanding of the system. The answer, we suggest, is because
of what the pattern means, not in any kind of immaterial or mystical sense, but in a way
that is grounded in the system’s interactions with the world, shaped by its history, and
instantiated in its physical structures.
In biology, natural selection infuses organisms with the purpose to persist. If organism
A is set up such that it out-persists organism B, then future populations are going to
look more like A than B. Over time, the set of surviving organisms is going to be the one
that is best set up to persist; that is, the set of organisms whose value-system, what is
seen as ‘good’ and what is seen as ‘bad’, is most optimally conducive to each organism’s
persistence, given its historical environment (compared with all the other possible ways in
which that value-system could be set up). In other words, a lineage’s successful persistence
over evolutionary timescales cashes out as meaning or normativity in the individual. For
example, the food chemical means something good to the bacterium because it was adaptive
in the past to move toward it, and so it is set up to do so again. The noxious chemical means
something bad because it similarly was adaptive to locomote away from it in the past, and
so it is disposed to do so. This meaning is grounded in its ancestors’ previous interactions
with the world and defined relative to their persistence; such that what the stimulus means
to an organism is often well-aligned with the effect that stimulus is going to have on its
chances of survival (based on the actual effect it had on previous generations).
In simple systems, the meaning of a signal can be pragmatically embodied through
direct coupling to some historically adaptive action. The first nervous systems, presumably
similar to the simple nerve nets observed in extant creatures such as Hydra and jellyfish,
may have co-evolved with muscles to allow coordinated movement of the various parts of
multicellular creatures. Linking these to sensory receptors could then allow appropriate
responses to be selected based on information about the external world in the context of
the animal’s own movements [70–72]. As organisms increased in complexity, perception
and action became decoupled, with the addition of intervening layers now operating on
internalised ‘representations’. These internal, representational patterns are still grounded
by links to the periphery in both directions (from perception and to action); that is, they

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

12 of 18

stand in exploitable relation to things in the world and adaptively inform action but they
can now be integrated and operated on in more complex ways [73–75].
Returning to the neural population, we now see that the interpreter is set up to
recognise and act in response to a given pattern because it is meaningful. If the pattern
co-varies with a state of affairs in the world that can be used to enhance survival, then
being configured to detect that pattern and use it to guide appropriate action in the world
is adaptive. In many cases, the particular neural pattern that comes to represent or “be
attached to” some referent is arbitrary, selected from a set of preconfigured endogenous
neural ensembles that happen to be active at the time of some experience [35]. The semiotic
relationships in the nervous system are thus not driven from the outside or determined
by physical properties [76]. Yet, treating the pattern as meaningful and turning it into
information that causally influences the next state of the system is going to lead to increased
persistence, and thus, over time, lead to a higher percentage of the population being
configured, not only to treat the pattern as meaningful, but for it to mean something
relevant to action and survival.
In effect, for systems that run on informational causation and emerge from an evolutionlike selection process that rewards persistence, it is meaning that drives the system and, thus,
informs behaviour. Moreover, the meaning inheres not just in the higher-order pattern itself
but also in the recognition and response to that pattern. This view thus undercuts vertically
reductive, eliminative claims that behaviour can be reduced to the flow of patterns of
neural activity, with the mental content or meaning of the encoded states being effectively
epiphenomenal. In fact, it inverts that logic. Neural patterns have causal power in the
system solely by virtue of what they mean to the organism as a whole.
Any attempt to understand or explain the causes of an organism’s behaviour is thus
doomed to fail if it takes a purely instantaneous view of the physical system. It is not
enough to account for how an organism behaves upon detecting some external stimulus
or physiological state of affairs—the ‘triggering cause’. We must also understand why
the system is configured such that it behaves in that way—the ‘structuring causes’ [69].
The actual causal influences are diachronic; that is, they extend through time. What gives
organisms causal power is the evaluative record of their past experiences and those of all
their ancestors (as well as, in a negative sense, all those unfortunate individuals who did
not leave offspring). This causal power is hard-earned. Both natural selection and learning
do causal design work, they configure the system in such a way that it embodies pragmatic
knowledge about the world and itself that can be used to direct adaptive action. Living
organisms thereby accrete causal power and come to act as causal agents in the world.
Crucially, agents do not just learn how to respond to things in the world and then
sit waiting for those stimuli. They adapt their endogenously generated patterns of active
behaviour to their environment and circumstances, learning what to learn from, what
information to seek out, and what active tactics and strategies to use to best pursue their
goals, crafting their own environments as they do so [77].
If we consider nervous systems as control systems, then we can broadly characterise
the meaning of various neural states as representing beliefs (about things in the world or
the state of the organism itself), desires (usually with short-term goals nested within a
framework of longer-term goals), and intentions (possible actions that may be considered,
evaluated, and ultimately selected for execution or not). Together with the foregoing
discussion, this seems to yield a naturalised account of how a system can do something
for its own reasons. Note that these reasons do not have to be conscious in order to justify
agent causation (and mostly, they will not be). We contend that to be a system in which
meaning is the causal driving force just is what it is to have reasons in the manner
necessary for agenthood.
However, there is, a remaining challenge from some theories of event causation.

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

2.8. Agent-Level Normativity
In complex organisms with nervous systems, what determines the flow of brain
activity from state to state is the meaning of the neural patterns. The idea that what an
organism does can be reduced to the neural patterns themselves is therefore not tenable;
the system is configured such that those patterns only have causal power by virtue of what
they mean, i.e., the psychological states that they correspond to (conscious or subconscious).
However, even if that inability to reduce decision-making to neural states is accepted, some
proponents of event-causation argue that psychological states, beliefs, desires, and intentions,
can do the necessary causal work. Under this view, the collection of such states at any given
moment constitutes the ‘events’ that determine what happens next; the agent is simply the
arena in which such states arise [12,78,79], (see [14] for an attempt to reduce the ‘agent’ to
the event).
We argue here that this view is incoherent. Beliefs, desires, and intentions are things
that only an agent can have. Neurons do not have beliefs; neural circuits do not have
desires; brains do not have intentions. Moreover, an intention is not a thing (either a
substance or an event) that can either exist or have causal power by itself. It is the agent
having the intention that has causal relevance to what happens. When the entire set of
such psychological states is taken into account at any moment, holistically integrated, as
described in Section 2.4, and freighted with historically grounded meaning as described in
Section 2.7, we contend that this just is agent causation.
The agent itself is the locus of meaning. That is, meaning inheres at the level of the
whole system, as an entity persisting through time, interacting with its environment and
being judged on its behaviour. Percepts, drives, actions, and their consequences mean
something for the whole agent, not for its parts. This derives from the fact that, from an
evolutionary perspective, the whole organism is the locus of fitness, not its parts. Natural
selection thus crafts the control systems of living organisms to detect, characterize, and
operate on signals as they are relevant for the survival of the whole organism. The chemotactic
system of E. coli, for example, is configured in the way that it is because it has been adaptive
for millions of preceding generations to move up a concentration gradient of a food source.
The value and meaning in that relationship are grounded relative to the purpose of the
entire system, which is to persist as a unified whole.
In the transition from unicellular to multicellular life, the locus of fitness shifted from
single cells to the multicellular whole. This transition involved a progressive division
of labour within clonal organisms, first in transiently aggregating colonies and then in
obligate multicellular creatures. In particular, the division of soma and germline means
that individual somatic cells give up any chance of reproducing directly. However, their
genetic material can be reproduced indirectly because it is shared with the germline cells.
Natural selection thus ceases to care about the fate of individual cells in the multicellular
organism; all that matters is that the organism as a whole survives and reproduces [80,81],
and the functional roles of all cells are directed towards that end.
In animals with nervous systems, cumulative feedback from natural selection configures the nervous system to enable the organisms to detect stimuli and action possibilities
in the environment that are most salient for the survival and reproduction of the whole
organism. Perception is egocentric, action-oriented, and laden with value from the get-go.
The goal is to create a map of objects out in the world that represent potential threats and
opportunities for the whole organism. In parallel, the action selection systems are fundamentally configured around actions of the whole organism—approach, avoidance, exploitation,
exploration—and whether those actions tend to be good or bad for the whole organism.
On both evolutionary and individual timescales, the agent is thus the locus of fitness.
It thereby becomes both the locus of meaning and also the locus of control that is informed
by and evaluated relative to that meaning. Of course, natural selection has not just given
animals hard-wired instincts. It has endowed them with systems to learn from their
experience, in particular systems of reinforcement learning that will up- or down-weight
action choices based on the outcomes of prior behaviour. Again, the value of these outcomes,

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

14 of 18

the thing that grounds the meaning of possible actions, is relative to and inheres at the level
of the whole organism. Individual neurons do not feel rewards or punishments; the agent
does, and it is the agent that is guided by these signals.
3. Summary
To summarise, we argued that the eight criteria outlined above constitute a completely
naturalistic way for systems to, in theory, exhibit agent causation. To recap, systems can
be agents if they are self-organising and causally insulated enough to persist through
time, out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the environment. To avoid external determinism, they need to be intrinsically active, treating external inputs more as helpful
information than determinate, causal forces. The proactive self-organising activity of these
systems entails a holistically integrated structure, in which parts are too interconnected
and context-dependent to be understood in a machine-like, decomposable, linear fashion
(contra horizontal reductionism). On top of this, these systems can be driven by meaning
and reasons because higher-order organisational patterns are able to coarse-grain over
microphysical happenings by virtue of the existence of some degree of indeterminacy at
lower levels. This meaning derives from temporally extended causal processes that shape
the physical structures of the system to reflect and respond to information about the world
that is relevant to it. The meaning of higher-order states is thus grounded in historical
interaction with the environment and attuned to given selection criteria (e.g., in natural
selection, the criteria is persistence and reproduction). We contend that a system whose
activity is informed by this kind of higher-order meaning just is a system that is acting for
reasons (contra vertical reductionism). Additionally, these reasons are rightfully understood
as inhering at the level of the whole system because that is where the locus of fitness is
that selects for them, that level is what those reasons are about, and so that is where the
appropriate locus of meaning and causality lies (contra event causation).
This set of conditions, if collectively met, avoid all three of the arguments set out in the
introduction—external determinism, vertical (causal) reductionism, and horizontal reductionism (including event-based causation). Moreover, it does so in a perfectly naturalistic
way, without the supposed mysticism or dualism that accounts of agent causation have
often been accused of. Perhaps most notably, it meets the challenge of Kim by showing that
the causation in the system is not wholly inherent in or captured by the low-level details of
all the physical components at any given moment. As living organisms demonstrate, any
such picture of the instantaneous state of an agential system misses the extended history of
causal influences that imbue the states with meaning relative to the goals of the system as a
whole, meaning on which the agent selects its actions. Thus, it would be wrong to reduce
causation to the system’s lowest level of description.
In setting out these criteria for the justification of agent causation in principle, we
simultaneously argued that biological organisms, in practice, may satisfy most, if not all, of
them. To reiterate, while we used living systems as model examples to help conceptualise
how each condition could conceivably be met, we did not intend to imply that living
organisms are necessarily the only things that could qualify as agents. The primary purpose
of the paper was to set out a plausible way in which agent causation could be realised
or naturalised in any theoretical system and in doing so, lay the groundwork for future
research that uses the framework to evaluate the agency of individual organisms or systems.
Indeed, we take the criteria presented here to be dimensional, as opposed to categorical. We would therefore expect that agents vary considerably in how they satisfy each
condition, with different systems perhaps performing strongly on some criteria but not
on others. In this sense, existing mathematical methods and formalisms for measuring
agency, and other related parameters such as autonomy, integration and consciousness,
are well-suited to quantifying the sort of multidimensional agency we have outlined here.
Different information-theoretic formalisms of causal emergence, for example, may be applied
to measuring higher-order causation within a system [82–85]. Similarly, attempts to formalise notions of individuality [81,86] and autonomy [87,88] can be used to measure how

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

15 of 18

endogenously active and free from determinate external forces a system is, by quantifying
the degree to which it may be more “interested in itself rather than the world outside” [89]
(p. 3). Finally, the criteria of holistic integration and informational causation more generally
fits neatly with the long-standing measures associated with Integrated Information Theory
(IIT) [90–92]. In sum, then, the framework presented here should help researchers working
on measuring agency to situate their findings within the context of agent causation. If the
analysis offered above is accurate, then agency is a multidimensional, multiply-realisable
concept that cannot be quantified in terms of a single parameter such as thermodynamic
autonomy, system-wide integration or emergent information. It is a composite concept,
with systems likely exhibiting different ‘agency profiles’ to one another and possibly even
differences across an individual’s lifespan.
4. Addendum: The Reductive Instinct
The idea that organisms can be causal agents, that they can act in the world, is entirely
in keeping with common thinking. Even very young children naturally attribute agency
to objects that appear to be moving under their own power and acting in an intentional
manner [93,94]. The framework we outline above provides a naturalistic way to think
about how such causal agency could emerge over phylogeny and ontogeny. Moreover, this
view of agents, adopting the ‘intentional stance’, is invaluable and arguably indispensable
in building explanatory theories of organismal behaviour [4,95,96]. Why then is this view
seen as problematic in philosophical circles, and why do so many scientists tend to fall
into a more reductive, mechanistic way of thinking that seems to eliminate agents from
the picture?
Part of the reason may be a slippage from methodological into theoretical reductionism. Biologists investigating the processes of life naturally try to isolate single processes
from the ongoing dynamics of the cell or organism and, further, try to isolate individual
components of those processes to understand their functional roles and, ultimately, the logic
of the entire process. To this end, they employ experimental techniques that powerfully
manipulate individual components and measure some specific outcomes while attempting
to hold as much of the background activity of the system constant. This horizontally
reductive approach is (apparently at least) extremely powerful, for example, in delineating
biochemical pathways or neural circuits mediating diverse cellular or organismal functions
and in assigning roles to the many components of such subsystems.
This approach naturally lends itself to thinking that an organism’s components truly
act in isolation from each other. Even in philosophy, there is a tendency to build logical
propositions, normative frameworks, or tightly constrained thought experiments that
consider properties or events in isolation when trying to understand the causal logic of a
system or tease out individual causal determinants in absolutist terms [97].
However, just because it is possible and often useful to experimentally or conceptually
isolate components or pathways or processes or properties, and to consider them separately,
while holding everything else constant, does not mean that these elements actually “work”
separately or have truly isolatable causal efficacy in the normal course of things. Even the
use of a term such as “working” may give an overly mechanistic framing [98]. Reductive
approaches foster an illusion of linear pathways with dedicated components. However, any
such picture relies on a forced perspective. Adopting different experimental or conceptual
perspectives usually reveals that the cellular components or neural circuits are functionally
involved in many different functions, that they have more promiscuous interactions than
revealed from a single angle, and that both their activity and the consequences of their
activity are highly context-dependent, integrated with the activity of other components
and subsystems.
The challenges in translating basic research findings obtained using these kinds of
reductive approaches to the clinic [99], in areas from cancer to psychiatry to neurodegenerative disorders, highlight the degree of hubris in thinking that complex dynamical systems
can truly be decomposed and that manipulations performed under controlled conditions in

Entropy 2022, 24, 472

the lab will have equally predictable and controllable outcomes “in the wild”. The apparent
successes of the reductive methodological approach thus need not, and we argue, should
not entail a commitment to theoretical reductionism.

Abstract: Can free agency be compatible with determinism? Compatibilists argue that the answer is
yes, and it has been suggested that the computer science principle of “computational irreducibility”
sheds light on this compatibility. It implies that there cannot, in general, be shortcuts to predict
the behavior of agents, explaining why deterministic agents often appear to act freely. In this
paper, we introduce a variant of computational irreducibility that intends to capture more accurately
aspects of actual (as opposed to apparent) free agency, including computational sourcehood, i.e.,
the phenomenon that the successful prediction of a process’ behavior must typically involve an
almost-exact representation of the relevant features of that process, regardless of the time it takes
to arrive at the prediction. We argue that this can be understood as saying that the process itself is
the source of its actions, and we conjecture that many computational processes have this property.
The main contribution of this paper is technical, in that we analyze whether and how a sensible
formal definition of computational sourcehood is possible. While we do not answer the question
completely, we show how it is related to finding a particular simulation preorder on Turing machines,
we uncover concrete stumbling blocks towards constructing such a definition, and demonstrate that
structure-preserving (as opposed to merely simple or efficient) functions between levels of simulation
play a crucial role.

1. Introduction
Do humans, animals, some machines, or other systems or processes have some sort
of control over their actions that deserves to be called “free will”? This question has been
discussed in various forms in the philosophical literature over the last two millenia (see,
e.g., Ref. [1] for an introduction). At first sight, the fact that agents are subject to the same
laws of nature as stones and atoms seems to be in tension with an intuitive understanding
of free will; after all, when an agent has taken a decision, they will fundamentally never
have had the “freedom to do otherwise”. Moreover, one might be inclined to think that
it is not the agent, but rather the laws of nature (and initial conditions) that represents
the “source” of the agent’s actions. While quantum theory suggests that the fundamental
laws of nature are best understood as probabilistic rather than deterministic, it has been
convincingly argued [2–4] that decisions are not free simply because they are random.
Therefore, the question of compatibility of determinism and free will remains relevant
even in the face of indeterminism (for the complementary question of compatibility of free
agency and indeterminism, see, e.g., [5]).

Among the various positions in the debate, compatibilism [3,6] amounts to the claim of
a positive answer to this question. Compatibilists have argued against the incompatibility
of free will and determinism in a variety of ways, such as by rejecting the idea that the
freedom to do otherwise is necessary for free will; by claiming that the freedom to do
otherwise is compatible with determinism; or by formulating ways in which sourcehood
can be ascribed to an agent even in a deterministic world (for an overview, see Ref. [7]).
In a complementary development, there have been proposals to analyze the relation
between determinism and free will via theoretical computer science. After all, we do not
live in an arbitrary deterministic (or probabilistic) world, but in a world that seems to
comply with physical versions of the Church–Turing thesis [8,9]. This suggests to treat
decision-making systems (including agents) and predictors as algorithms in some sense,
and to contemplate aspects of free will with information-theoretic notions and methods.
Two such approaches (described in more detail in Section 2 below) offer an explanation
for why some physical systems (in particular human agents) appear to have free will. One
approach, computational irreducibility [10–13], demonstrates that the behavior of many
physical systems cannot be predicted without simulating every single step of their time
evolution in full detail. Another approach, based on time complexity arguments [14], shows
that it takes typically more time to predict an agent’s actions than it takes the agent to come
to its decision by itself. In a nutshell, decision making systems do not in general admit shortcuts.
However, as already noted by Bringsjord [15], this insight in itself may explain some of
the phenomenology of free will, but it does not have much to say about whether agents are
actually free.
In this paper, we suggest to study a variant of computational irreducibility that is
intended to formalize an aspect of actual free will more directly, a computational notion of
sourcehood. In a nutshell, we ascribe computational sourcehood to a computable process P
if attempts to reproduce its outputs can typically only succeed by running an almost-exact
step-by-step simulation that contains all functionally relevant aspects of P. In contrast to
computational irreducibility, we do not focus on the time it takes to perform the simulation,
i.e., computational sourcehood claims that such “cloning” of the simulated process is also
necessary if the simulation takes an arbitrarily long time. Thus, if we regard the collection
of all relevant abstract information-theoretic elements of P as (part of) an agent, then it is
always this agent that is invoked when P’s behavior is generated, reproduced or predicted.
We conjecture that this kind of sourcehood is indeed “typical”, i.e., that it can be attributed
to a large variety of computational processes.
We will follow a careful terminology choice also made by Müller and Briegel [5]: we
will mostly avoid talking about “free will” (unless when we follow other authors), and use
the notion of “free agency” instead, in order to avoid arousing associations with specifically
human aspects of this notion. As Müller and Briegel put it, “In philosophy, free will is mostly
tied to specifically human traits, such as being the proper subject of moral praise and blame, or a
capacity for conscious deliberation or for the linguistic expression of self-reflective thought.” These
traits are irrelevant for the purpose of this paper, since we will concentrate on a single
specific notion, that of sourcehood, and the question of whether a technical, formal definition
of it can be found. It is clear that the specifically human notions mentioned above can play
no role in such a definition.
For similar reasons, details of the human decision-making process (as described, for
example, by neuroscience or biology) will play no role in our analysis, and so will questions
of semantics as discussed in general theories of information [16]. Similarly to Lloyd’s, our
analysis will operate on a more abstract level, and the in-principle applicability of our
results to physical systems, including humans, can be motivated by the simple observation
that “[. . .] because the known laws of physics can be simulated on a computer, the dynamics of the
brain can be simulated by a computer in principle—it is not necessary that we know how to simulate
the operation of the brain in practice.” [14]. A different motivation for our approach (and those
by Lloyd and Wolfram) may come from versions of the computational theory of mind [17].

The purpose of our paper is not to argue for any of those views, but to consider a specific
technical question about algorithms that can be motivated by them.
Our article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief summary of previous
“no-shortcut” approaches to apparent free agency, including computational irreducibility
and time complexity arguments. We introduce the idea of computational sourcehood and
its difference to computational irreducibility with a thought experiment (“John the cook”)
in Section 3 and more formally in Section 4. Section 5 contains the technical results of
this paper, including successively improved attempts at formally defining a version of
computational sourcehood that is non-trivial, meaningful, and has the chance to lead to a
sensible formulation of our main conjecture (that many processes are the computational
sources of their behaviors). Finally, we conclude in Section 6.
2. No-Shortcut Approaches to Apparent Free Agency
In this section, we briefly summarize two approaches intended to explain the phenomenology of free agency using a computational perspective. Both approaches have in
common that they identify the huge effort necessary to predict an agent’s decisions as an
account of apparent freedom. As we will see, the approaches differ in how they expose the
difficulty of agent predictions. While the first approach (which is closely related to ours)
focuses on the non-existence of shortcuts and simplifications in the prediction process, the
second approach focuses on computation time and uncomputability.
2.1. Computational Irreducibility
One concept in computer science that has been suggested to shed new light on the
relation between free agency and determinism is computational irreducibility, proposed by S.
Wolfram [10].
To explain this concept, let us consider the success of scientific predictions. Most
physical systems are extremely complex objects constructed from a vast number of smaller
parts. Nonetheless, often the behavior of crucial properties of such complex systems can
be described with a few equations. For example, in mechanics, many of the considered
physical systems are extended objects. Such systems consist of countless atoms, which
themselves are built from smaller particles. However, as we know from our mechanics
lectures, predicting the evolution of the mechanical properties of these systems often does
not require a simulation of all the individual parts. e.g., in astronomy, the orbits of gas
planets can be well approximated via Kepler’s laws, without the need to consider all the
gas molecules involved in the movement of the planet.
These considerations teach us that the behavior of some important properties of complex physical systems can be predicted without having to model all their microscopic
features. This implies that these predictions are possible because the simulation allows for
massive shortcuts and simplifications. Now, Wolfram’s concept of computational irreducibility refers to the observation that not all physical properties and complex systems allow
for such shortcuts and simplifications. In other words, there exist physical questions that
require a near-perfect simulation of all the details involved to be answered. While Wolfram
formulates this notion for computable processes, he follows a strong intuition that our
physical world does indeed correspond to a computation of some sort. Physical versions of
the Church–Turing thesis aim to substantiate such intuitions in different possible ways [8,9].
In their book [10], Wolfram suggests the possibility that agents, including humans,
show behavior that is computationally irreducible, even if the agent is deterministic. In
other words, answering some questions about the future of an agent might require full simulation of all functionally relevant details of the agent’s thought process and environment.
Wolfram argues that this might be the origin of apparent free will:
“And it is this, I believe, that is the ultimate origin of the apparent freedom of human
will. For even though all the components of our brains presumably follow definite laws, I
strongly suspect that their overall behavior corresponds to an irreducible computation
whose outcome can never in effect be found by reasonable laws.”

This explanation of free will was criticized by S. Bringsjord [15] as being “epistemologically correct”, but “metaphysically wrong”, in particular:
“If someone’s will is apparently free, it hardly follows that that will is in fact free.
Nowhere in ANKS [his book] does Wolfram even intimate that he maintains that our
decisions are in fact free.”
We will reconsider this distinction, and the role of computational notions in its analysis, in Section 4, where we take it as an inspiration to introduce a modified version of
computational irreducibility.
While Wolfram discusses the phenomenology and implications of computational
irreducibility and provides examples in terms of cellular automata, he does not give an
exact formalization of this notion in Ref. [10]. Such a formal definition has been proposed
via Turing machines by H. Zwirn and J.-P. Delahaye [11,12]. In a nutshell, they call a
function f : N → N computationally irreducible if all efficient Turing machines computing
f (n) will essentially also have to compute f (1), . . . , f (n − 1). While this corresponds
to a straightforward implementation of the main properties of Wolfram’s examples (in
particular if f (n) encodes the nth row of a cellular automaton), it is not clear whether this
formulation is the most suitable one for the study of free agency. Additionally, since many
choices of detail have to be made in the construction of the definition, it is not clear how
many functions actually satisfy it.
2.2. Lloyd’s Time Complexity Argument
Secondly, we consider S. Lloyd’s [14] idealization of agents as Turing machines, more
specifically as computable deciders. Such deciders are Turing machines that map a description of a decision problem to a yes/no answer, or fail to come to a conclusion. More
formally, a (computable) decider d is identified with a Turing machine that receives an input
string k, and outputs d(k) ∈ {0, 1} or fails to halt, i.e., d(k ) undefined. Lloyd considers a
function f (d, k) that is supposed to predict the answers of all such deciders d for all inputs
k. By adapting the proof of the halting problem, Lloyd argues that such a function must
be uncomputable:
“The unpredictability of the decision-making process does not arise from any lack of
determinism—the Turing machines involved could be deterministic, or could possess
a probabilistic guessing module, or could be quantum mechanical. In all cases, the
unpredictability arises because of uncomputability.”
Nonetheless, as Lloyd points out, decisions in real environments usually have to
be made within a limited amount of time. Therefore, he considers time-limited deciders
and argues that for such time-limited deciders a program predicting all decisions is computable. However:
“In summary, applying the Hartmanis–Stearns diagonalization procedure shows that
any general method for answering the question ‘Does decider d make a decision in time T,
and what is that decision?’ must for some decisions take strictly longer than T to come up
with an answer. That is, any general method for determining d’s decision must sometimes
take longer than it takes d actually to make the decision.”
Using the diagonalization argument to discuss self-reference of universal deciders,
Lloyd arrives at the following conclusion about free will:
“Now we see why most people regard themselves as possessing free will. Even if the world
and their decision-making process is completely mechanistic—even deterministic—no
decider can know in general what her decision will be without going through a process at
least as involved as the decider’s own decision-making process. In particular, the decider
herself cannot know beforehand what her decision will be without effectively simulating
the entire decision-making process. However, simulating the decision-making process
takes at least as much effort as the decision-making process itself.”

3. John the Cook: A Thought Experiment
To set the stage, consider the following thought experiment. Suppose that John Smith is
a very talented (and emotional) cook. Every morning, he decides what kind of breakfast to
prepare, but their repertoire of meals is very large. On some mornings, he might remember
their late Canadian wife and then prepare a particular omelette with cranberries and maple
syrup. On other mornings, he might prepare a Pho soup in memory of their travels to
Vietnam. The number of different breakfasts he might cook extends into the thousands.
Suppose we would like to predict what John is going to eat tomorrow morning.
Furthermore, suppose that our prediction task is made particularly easy by assuming that
physics is perfectly deterministic, and, in fact, computable and discrete at some microscopic
scale. Since we know that John is going to spend the evening and night in their apartment,
we are going to build a huge machine around their house; it scans the apartment to perfect
accuracy, and then simulates their apartment (including John’s brain and body) on an
extremely powerful computer. We would like our simulation to tell us John’s choice
of breakfast well before dawn; it is certainly more fun to make a prediction before the
predicted event has happened. To set the stage, consider the following thought experiment
(illustrated in Figure 1).

Figure 1. A universal computer (in the safe, on the right) reproduces the outputs of another process,
i.e., its observable actions (John preparing breakfast, on the left). Computational sourcehood means
that this prediction cannot typically be successfully performed without representing all relevant
elements (here: thoughts, emotions) of that process in the simulation.

However, we are familiar with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility and
are thus warned that the simulation may have to be really detailed in order to succeed.
Furthermore, Lloyd’s arguments [14] apply, so we should be prepared that our simulation
finishes only after John has arrived at their decision. Therefore, we take precautions; directly
after scanning John and their apartment, before starting the simulation, we put the scan
data and the computer into an immensely secure safe.
If the simulation finishes before breakfast, we can directly confront John with our
successful prediction. Otherwise, we can invite John to our laboratory and let them witness
how we open the safe and obtain the delayed prediction. In both cases, we might then be
inclined to say (unjustifiably, as we argue below):
“See, John? You think that you and your emotions were irreducibly involved in
the decision to prepare the Canadian omelette, but what happened in the safe was only
determined by your (and your apartment’s) physical state yesterday night. Your thoughts
and emotions this morning had no impact on the decision whatsoever!”
However, would this denial of free agency indeed by justified? We argue that the
answer to this question does not depend on any possible time delay in this thought experiment. The crux of the situation—that reproducing the decision seems in principle possible
without an element that John regards as a crucial aspect of their free will—is the same
regardless of the simulation time. However, this suggests that questions of efficiency should
ultimately be irrelevant for the problem of free agency.
We argue that the relevant question is a different one. An important aspect of John’s
impression to make a free, autonomous choice is that the particular class of emotions and

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

6 of 22

thoughts in their mind are in some meaningful sense the source of the decision, the choice of
breakfast. That is, not only have they been involved in the causal chain of physical events
leading to a particular decision, but their presence seems indispensable to ultimately arrive at
the decision. This motivates us to ask a specific question about the simulation in the safe:
did the simulation necessarily contain correlates of these emotions and thoughts? In other words,
did the simulation—and does every successful simulation—also have to “think about John’s
late wife” in some sense?
If the answer is “no” and such simulations can typically predict the decision by
completely unrelated means—say, either by a drastic shortcut or by a completely different
method—then John may rightly be worried. On the other hand, a positive answer to this
question opens up the possibility to ascribe John sourcehood for their decisions. As is
standard for some compatibilist positions [7], we can do so by interpreting these thoughts
and emotions as parts of John’s identity. In other words, if we identify John the agent not
with the particular matter that encompasses their brain in the apartment, but with the
collection of functionally relevant structures represented in their brain, then this agent is the source
of its decisions; the simulated process in the safe has simply contained another representation
of John.
It is not the purpose of this paper to make these conceptual ideas and arguments
philosophically fully rigorous. Instead, the above merely serves as a motivation to consider
a specific technical question in computer science: can we find a formal definition of a notion
of “computational sourcehood” which expresses the property above in a sensible way? That
is, if an algorithm simulates the behavior of another one, does it typically have to reproduce
its features exactly? We argue that the possibility of formalization of this idea is a necessary
condition for even considering any philosophically advanced and detailed instantiation
of these ideas; the impossibility of formalization is often an important indicator that the
motivating ideas cannot hold water.
4. Computational Sourcehood
Let us begin by rephrasing some aspects of the “John the cook” thought experiments
in computer science terminology. Think of John as a Turing machine (TM) T, with the
configuration of John’s apartment and the content of their brain yesterday night as the
input, and think of the computer in the safe as a universal TM U. (Here we focus on
TMs only because it is the most well-known model of computation, and we think that our
results are independent of the choice of model that is used to implement computations.)
John’s observable actions (in particular, their choice of breakfast) are to be found among
T’s outputs, and U is able to reproduce these outputs exactly. Does this tell us anything
about the way how U arrives at these outputs?
Intuitively, universal TMs simulate other TMs T exactly and step by step; as we will
explain below, this is certainly true for all universal TMs that are described in standard textbooks. Now, if this is true for the computer in the safe, then the answer to the above question
is positive: yes, the computer has reproduced copies of the neural correlates (representations) of
John’s thoughts and emotions. However, is this so by necessity?
Universal TMs U can be fed a description of another TM T together with some input
x, and they can use this to compute the output of T on input x. It seems extremely hard to
imagine that there would be any other way for U to do so rather than by simulating T step
by step—with perhaps some rare exceptions (some TMs T may have obvious inefficiencies
that can easily be shortcut by U). Thus, it is natural to conjecture that there is a large class of
Turing machines T such that all universal TMs have to resort to some form of step-by-step
simulation to simulate them on most inputs:
Informal Conjecture. There is a large class of Turing machines T that are “the source of
their own actions” in the following sense. Consider any TM U that is universal, i.e., that can
emulate every other TM T; that is,
U ( pT , x) = T (x)

(1)

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

7 of 22

for every TM T and every input x on which T halts, where T 7→ p T is an effective description
of the TM T. Then, for all T ∈ T, the universal TM U will generate the output U ( p T , x ) for
most inputs x in such a way that it contains during its simulation, in suitable form and at
suitable time steps, exact copies of the subsequent states that the machine T takes during
its computation on input x.
We may then speak of either T, or a given pair ( T, x ), as an instance of “computational sourcehood”.
Establishing a formal version of this conjecture would allow us to reason that John can be
viewed in a specific sense as the “source of their own actions”, assuming that the Turing
machine T he implements is contained in the set T. However, regardless of the problem of
free agency, establishing or disproving formal versions of the above might yield interesting
insights into the nature of universal computation.
Clearly, this notion of computational sourcehood is closely related to computational
irreducibility, as both concepts claim that an exact representation is necessary for prediction. However, computational irreducibility focuses more on the impossibility to speed
up a computation, whereas computational sourcehood claims more generally that every
successful prediction of the results of a computation must involve an exact image of the
original, even slow ones. This implies, in particular, that no essential speed-ups are possible,
but it makes additional claims about the structure of simulations, including those that take
substantially longer time.
5. Towards a Rigorous Formulation of the Conjecture
This section assumes familiarity with some basic notions of computer science, such
as Turing machines, prefix codes, and computability; for an introduction, see, e.g., [18–21].
To fix some notation, we will denote the set of natural numbers by N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}
(which includes zero), and the set of finite binary strings by

{0, 1}∗ = {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, . . .},
where ε is the empty string. The length of a string s ∈ {0, 1}∗ will be denoted `(s), with
`(ε) = 0. In general, if Σ is any finite alphabet, the set of finite words over Σ will be
denoted Σ∗ .
5.1. Textbook Universal Turing Machines Behave as Conjectured
It is a straightforward yet cumbersome exercise to formally construct a universal TM
in a rigorous way. We will now sketch a construction given in the textbook by Hennie [18];
for another choice, see, e.g., Hopcroft et al. [19].
TMs come in different versions. What all definitions have in common is a finite set Q
of internal states of the machine, including an identified initial state q0 (and sometimes a
final state q f 6= q0 ). Every TM has a finite number n of tapes, such that each tape has a set of
cells that is either indexed by the natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, . . .} (a “one-way infinite”
tape) or by the integers Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} (a “two-way infinite” tape). Every
tape cell contains one symbol of a finite alphabet Σ, and there is a special “blank symbol”
# ∈ Σ that is carried by all but finitely many tape cells. For every tape, the TM has a tape
head that moves along that tape and points at a particular cell at any given time.
Single steps of operation are determined by a (perhaps partial) transition function,
which we may write as
δ : (q,~σ ) 7→ (q0 ,~σ0 , d~).
We interpret this as follows. At every time step, if the TM is in internal state q and reads the
symbols ~σ = (σ1 , . . . , σn ) on its n tapes (the content of the cells where the tape heads are
pointing), then it replaces the tape contents by ~σ0 = (σ10 , . . . , σn0 ), transitions into the new
internal state q0 , and moves the head on tape i either to the left (if di = L), to the right (if
di = R), or not at all (if di = N).

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

The initial state of the TM—in particular, the way that the input is supplied to the
tapes—depends on the convention of choice, except that the initial internal state is always
assumed to be q0 . For our purpose, we assume that all but a finite number of tape cells
must initially carry the blank symbol #, so that the input is finite in this sense. If, at any time
step, the TM reaches the state q f , then it “halts”, and the content of one or all of the tapes
is—according to some choice of convention—interpreted as the TM’s output. Depending on
the choice of convention, there may also be other events that are interpreted as “halting”
(in particular, if the TM is not assumed to have a distinguished state q f ∈ Q); for example,
trying to turn left from cell 0 of a one-way infinite tape, or having δ undefined on the
current combination of q and ~σ.
Hennie [18] makes a particular choice of convention for defining TMs and for constructing a universal TM. He considers TMs that have a single (n = 1) one-way infinite tape,
no final state q f , and a finite alphabet Σ = {0, 1, . . . , k }, where 0 denotes the blank symbol.
The set of internal states is denoted Q = {0, 1, . . . , m}, where q0 := 0 is the initial state. The
tape head direction can be either left (L = 0) or right (R = 1), but the head cannot stay at
its current position. The TM is assumed to halt if it either runs off the tape (to the left of
cell 0), or if it lands in a combination of internal state q and tape symbol σ, such that δ(q, σ )
is undefined. Hennie is not particularly explicit in defining what the “input” or “output”
of the TM computation shall be (some function of the initial resp. final tape pattern): the
choice of convention for how to do so can be adapted to the desired context.
Values of the transition function like
δ(q, σ ) = (q0 , σ0 , d)
are represented via quintuples

(q, σ, σ0 , d, q0 ).

Hence, every TM T can be represented as a finite list of such quintuples. We will consider
this list to be ordered, and by convention to start with a quintuple that begins with the
starting state q0 . We now obtain the first step of Hennie’s construction of a universal TM,
the choice of description p T of a TM T. The description p T will be a binary string, namely
a unary representation of the quintuples that define T. This is best explained by one of
Hennie’s examples. Consider the TM described by the quintuples

(q0 , 1, 0, R, g1 ),
(q2 , 0, 0, L, q3 ),

(q1 , 0, 1, R, q2 ), (q1 , 1, 1, R, q1 ),
(q3 , 0, 0, R, q0 ), (q3 , 1, 1, L, q3 ).

Recalling that internal states and directions are also integers, we obtain the equivalent (but
less readable) form

(0, 1, 0, 1, 1),
(2, 0, 0, 0, 3),

(1, 0, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
(3, 0, 0, 1, 0), (3, 1, 1, 0, 3).

Denoting k consecutive 1’s by 1k , the unary representation of a quintuple is

( a, b, c, d, e) 7→ 1a+1 01b+1 01c+1 01d+1 01e+1 ,
and we will describe a sequence of quintuples by concatenating the descriptions of each
quintuple, separated by pairs of blank symbols (zeros). That is, our representation of the
example TM becomes
1011010110110011010110110111001101101101101100
111010101011110011110101011010011110110110101111.

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

In addition to the description p T of the TM T, we also have to supply our universal TM U
with the tape content x of TM T. Formally,
U ( p T , x ) = U (h p T , x i),
where h p T , x i is the initial tape content of U that by definition encodes the pair p T and x.
Note that we cannot simply define h p T , x i to be the concatenation of p T and x; first, the
machine needs to know where p T ends and x starts; and second, the alphabet ΣU of U will,
in general, be different from the alphabet Σ T of T (potentially containing fewer elements),
so that x cannot in general be directly copied from T’s tape to that of U.
Hennie chooses the following construction. Given the initial tape content x =
x1 x2 x3 . . . of T (with xi ∈ Σ T ), consider the unary encoding
xu := 1x1 +1 01x2 +1 01x3 +1 . . .
By construction, the TM U shall contain three distinguished “marking symbols” A, B, C ∈
ΣU \ {0, 1}. Then, the full encoding is defined as

h p T , x i = A0|QT |+|ΣT |+2 Bp T 000Cxu .
In summary, the cells between A and B represent a buffer region that is large enough to
contain a unary representation of T’s current internal state q and currently scanned tape
symbol σ. The region between B and C contains the description of T, and the rest of the
tape contains a description of T’s initial tape content.
In essence, the TM U is constructed to work as follows. It copies the current description
of T’s internal state q (which is what succeeds the B marker) and the current description
of T’s scanned tape cell σ (succeeding the C marker) into the buffer region. Then, U scans
the p T region to find the quintuple beginning with the combination (q, σ ) inscribed in
the buffer region (if no such quintuple is found then U halts) and moves the B marker in
front of that quintuple. Finally, U reads the direction d ∈ { L, R} and new tape symbol
description σ0 ∈ Σ T , updates T’s tape description accordingly, and moves the C marker
either left or right (if it moves left then it checks whether this would imply that simulated
T runs off the tape; if so U halts). Then it restarts this cycle.
For a more detailed description of U, see [18] (Sec. 2.3). In principle, to define U, one
would have to give the detailed definition of its transition function δU (or, equivalently,
its long list of defining quintuples). This would be extremely cumbersome. Hence, what
is done instead is to argue that subroutines such as “copying” or “searching” can be
incorporated into the definition of U by effectively using other TMs as “submachines”. This
is explained in [18] (Sec. 2.1).
More generally, in the rest of the paper, we will often simply describe in words how
a TM is supposed to work on the contents of its tapes, and assume that this can in fact
be implemented in the definition of the TM in some way. In addition to the possibility of
checking the validity formally for each single case, such reasoning is standardly justified
via the Church–Turing thesis.
To formulate in (semi-formal) detail how Hennie’s construction satisfies our conjecture,
let us introduce one additional piece of notation. Given any TM T, input x, and time t ∈ N,
denote by
C T ( x, t)
the configuration of T after having computed for t steps on input x. With “configuration”,
we mean a complete description of the content of its tapes, of its internal state q, and of the
location of its tape head(s). The (countable) set of all possible configurations of TM T will
be denoted C T . The countable set of all configurations that any Turing machine of this sort
S
can hold is denoted C := T TM C T ; this is the set of all configurations where the control
is in some integer state, the tape head points somewhere, and finitely many tape cells are

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

filled by integers (and the rest with blanks). This allows us to formulate the following
observation.
Observation 1. Hennie’s universal TM U has the following property. There exists a “simple”
function ϕ : CU → C and, for every TM T, an increasing function τT : N → N, such that

CT ( x, t) = ϕ CU (h p T , x i, τT (t)) .
In other words, the time evolution of T on input x can “easily be read off” from the time evolution of
U on inputs p T and x, with a possible slowdown t 7→ τT (t).
Moreover, the function τT has a simple characterization in the following way. If we follow the
step-by-step evolution of U ( p T , x ) for times τ = 1, 2, 3, . . ., then we can directly observe whether
τ = τT (t) for some t or not. Namely, if U has returned to the beginning of its simulation cycle at
time τ, then this is the case, and otherwise not. We can determine t by starting at t = 0, and by
increasing t by one whenever U’s computation restarts its cycle.
In other words, Hennie’s universal TM works exactly as described in our Informal Conjecture; it simulates every TM T step by step, and reproduces exact images of the computational state of T at suitable time steps.
In most textbooks, emphasis is placed on the fact that the simulation of T by U leads to
a slowdown that is at most polynomial; in our notation, this means that the function t 7→ τt
grows at most polynomially. However, for our purpose, this fact is not particularly relevant;
as discussed earlier, we are not interested in the time it takes to arrive at a prediction, but
in the information that is involved in generating the prediction.
The function ϕ is essentially an extended “snapshot function” of the simulated TM [20].
It can easily be described in words: the obtain T’s internal state q at time t, just look at
the buffer region to the right of symbol A at time τt . To see the position of the tape head,
simply search for the marker C and count groups of ones; to determine the content of type
cell i, count i groups of ones right of the left-most 000 and translate the corresponding 1xi +1
into xi . This is a very “simple” function; yet, in what sense a general definition of “simple”
should apply to all universal computers is a non-trivial question that we will address next.
5.2. A Simulation Preorder on TMs
Do all universal TMs satisfy a version of Observation 1, as Hennie’s universal TM
does? To address this question, we first need to give a general definition of a universal
TM U. In Section 4, we have intuitively thought of universal TMs as those that satisfy
Equation (1). Note, however, that Hennie’s universal TM does not satisfy that equation,
but rather
T ( x ) = ψ(U ( p T , x )),
(2)
where ψ is another “simple function” that extracts T’s final tape content from that of U.
Namely, U does not exactly end with the same output as T, but with a certain unary
encoding of its output, preceding by a a buffer region, a description of T, and three markers.
This is necessary because the tape alphabets of T and U need not be identical. The map ψ
implements the corresponding decoding.
Note that Equation (2) cannot be used as a definition of the notion of universal
TM, unless the map ψ is carefully restricted. In particular, if we only demand that ψ is
computable, then the “identity machine” that simply outputs the input (i.e., that “does
nothing”) would count as universal:
U ( p T , x ) ≡ U (h p T , x i) := h p T , x i.
This is because we can define ψ to be the computable partial function ψ(h p T , x i) := T ( x ).
In this way, we can shift the full computation completely into the process of “reading the
output”. This is certainly not intended.
Thus, we will here use a TM definition which avoids the “output decoding” issue:

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

Definition 1 (Turing machine (TM)). In the remainder of this paper, unless mentioned otherwise,
a TM T is always assumed to conform to the following requirements. The TM has a set of internal
states Q = {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} with k ∈ N, where q0 := 0 is the initial state and q f := k − 1
the final state. The TM has two bidirectional tapes (input and work tape), and one unidirectional
tape (the output tape). The input tape is read-only, i.e., its content cannot be modified during the
computation. The finite alphabet for all tapes is Σ = {0, 1, #}. The input is a finite binary string
x ∈ {0, 1}∗ that is initially written on the cells 0, 1, . . . , `( x ) − 1 of the input tape. All other cells
of all tapes are initially blank (#). All tape heads start in position zero. At each step of operation, the
input and work tape heads can independently either move to the left or to the right. Furthermore,
the machine may write a bit (0 or 1) at the current cell of the output tape and move its output tape
head one position to the right (but not to the left), or it leaves the output tape as it is. If the machine
halts, i.e., enters the distinguished internal state q f , then the TM’s output, y, is the finite binary
string that has so far been written onto the output tape. If this happens, then we write T ( x ) = y.
This defines a partial function from the finite binary strings to the finite binary strings.
A configuration of a TM is a description of some internal state q ∈ Q, of the number | Q| of
internal states, of some positions of the tape heads, and some finite information content of the tapes
(all but finitely many cells are blank). The countable set of all possible configurations will be denoted
by C .
By uni/bidirectional, we mean that the head can be moved in only one/both of the
directions. The notions of input and output are perfectly clear for such a TM. Moreover, a
TM of this kind resembles our idea of “John preparing breakfast” from Section 1; we can
observe the machine creating its output bits one after the other. No output bit will ever
be erased; the output is complete once the machine has halted. In some sense, the output
tape resembles “John’s subsequently observable actions”, and the work tape resembles
“John’s brain”.
We can now define a notion of universal TM in the following way.
Definition 2 (Universal TM). A TM U is universal if it satisfies the following conditions. There
exists a decidable prefix code { p T } T , where T labels the Turing machines, such that p T ∈ {0, 1}∗ is
a computable description of the TM T; that is, there is an algorithm that extracts the set of internal
states Q and the transition function δ from p T . Furthermore,
U ( p T x ) = T ( x ) for all x ∈ {0, 1}∗ ;

(3)

in particular, U ( p T x ) is undefined if, and only if, T ( x ) is undefined (corresponding to the fact the
the TM T does not halt on input x). Here, p T x denotes the binary string obtained from concatenating
p T and x.
That is, a universal TM U takes the description of a TM T as input, and then imitates its
output behavior on the rest of the input. Note that this definition is strictly stronger than the
usual definition of a universal TM as used in algorithmic information theory [22,23]; there,
it is only demanded that for every TM T there is some p T ∈ {0, 1}∗ , such that Equation (3)
holds, but it is not explicitly demanded that a description of T can be reconstructed
from p T . Decidability of the prefix code { p T } means that there is a computable function
f : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1} with f (s) = 1 if, and only if, s ∈ { p T }—i.e., there exists an algorithm
that decides for every given string whether that string is a valid encoding of a TM or not.
Do all universal TMs behave in a way that is similar to Hennie’s, i.e., as described in
Observation 1? To address this question, we will need a formal definition of a suitable set of
“simple functions” that extract the configuration of the simulated TM from the configuration
of the universal TM. Instead of trying to settle right away how this set S of simple functions
should be defined, let us begin with some basic properties that are immediately clear
given our goals. Every ϕ ∈ S is a function ϕ : C 0 → C 0 , where C 0 := C ∪ {∅} is the
set of TM configurations, supplemented by an additional element ∅ 6∈ C which we can
interpret as denoting “not a valid configuration”. We demand that ϕ(∅) = ∅ for all ϕ ∈ S .

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

12 of 22

Furthermore, we assume that S is closed under composition, i.e., if ϕ, ψ ∈ S then ϕ ◦ ψ ∈ S ,
and that the identity map is in S . We also assume that the functions in S are computable
and total.
Now consider the sequence of configurations CU ( p T x, t) for t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The idea is
that for some t0 , the universal TM U has just completed another simulated step of operation
of T. If we denote the number of simulated time steps by t (such that t ≤ t0 ), then we would
like our simple function ϕ to yield

CT ( x, t) = ϕ CU ( p T x, t0 ) .
Otherwise, the right-hand side will simply yield ∅. On the one hand, this means that
we obtain
C T ( x, t) = ϕ(CU ( p T x, τT (t)))
exactly as in Observation 1, for some increasing set of integers t 7→ τT (t). On the other
hand, if T halts on input x at time t H , this allows us to obtain the sequence

CT ( x, 0), CT ( x, 1), . . . , CT ( x, t H )
by parsing the sequence

CU ( p T x, 0), CU ( p T x, 1), . . . , CU ( p T x, t0H )
via application of ϕ to each entry, discarding those where ϕ takes the value ∅. This
motivates the following definition.
Definition 3 (Simulation preorder). Let T and T 0 be TMs. Suppose that, relative to our choice
of simple functions S , there is some ϕ ∈ S such that for every input x ∈ {0, 1}∗ , the sequence
of configurations
CT ( x, 0), CT ( x, 1), . . . , CT ( x, t H ),
where t H is the halting time if T halts on input x, and ∞ otherwise, can be obtained by processing
the sequence of configurations

CT 0 ( x, 0), CT 0 ( x, 1), CT 0 ( x, 2), . . . , CT 0 ( x, t0H ),
where t0H is the halting time of T 0 on input x, and ∞ otherwise, in the following way. One after the
other, apply ϕ to the C T 0 ( x, •), and if the result is not ∅, then append the result to the list. In this
case, we will say that T 0 simulates T and write
T S T 0 .
Note that this implies that t H ≤ t0H .
Since the identity function is in S , we have T S T for all TMs T. Furthermore, T S T 0
and T 0 S T 00 implies T S T 00 , since simple functions can be composed. This implies that
S is a preorder on the TMs.
The notion of a simulation preorder is well-known in the literature. However, all
definitions that we are aware of, including Milner’s seminal work [24], define a notion of
simulation that is too strict for our purpose. To the best of our knowledge, these definitions
postulate that some machine S simulates another machine T if there is an injection of T’s
states into those of S, such that each single state transition of T corresponds to a single state
transition of S. These definitions are very natural for finite automata [25]; however, for
TMs, we need a looser definition of simulation that allows S to simulate a single step of T
within more than one time step.
When we compare the computation of T with its simulation by U, we have an additional prefix p T on the input, as explained above. The behavior sketched above will

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

then be abbreviated by writing T S U ( p T •). We use this notation for our first attempt to
formalize our conjecture:
Conjecture (1st attempt). For every universal TM U, we have
T S U ( p T •) for every TM T.

(4)

At first sight this seems plausible: universal TMs operate by taking the description p T of
any other TM T, and by then simulating T step by step.
However, it is easy to see that this conjecture cannot literally hold true. Consider a
Turing machine T0 that operates as follows. On input x, it begins by computing the 2`( x) th
prime number in binary on its work tape. After that, it halts unconditionally. This Turing
machine T will output the empty string on every input, i.e., T0 ( x ) = ε for all x ∈ {0, 1}∗ ,
and it will do so extremely inefficiently. In fact, let us consider an infinite sequence of
modifications of this inefficient machine, labelled by Ti . All the Ti are identical to T0 , but they
have i additional internal states that are all irrelevant for all their computations. That is, the
transition functions of all Ti are that of T0 , and if Q0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} is the set of internal
states of T0 , then the set of internal states of Ti is Qi := {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1, k, . . . , k − 1 + i }.
Consider now some standard textbook universal TM U, but modify it such that it does
the following. In the very beginning, U will examine the p T -part of the input, and check
whether p T is a description of any of the Ti , i.e., whether p T = p Ti for some i. If not, then U
will proceed like the textbook machine; otherwise, it will refrain from simulating Ti , and
instead halt (and output ε) immediately and unconditionally.
In this case, there will be infinitely many counterexamples to Equation (4), namely all
the T = Ti will violate it.
Indeed, we have already formulated our Informal Conjecture in a more careful way;
not all TMs T, but only those that lie in a large set T are conjectured to represent instances
of computational sourcehood. Intuitively, T contains all TMs that operate neither in a trivial
nor in an extremely inefficient way on all inputs. This leads us to the second attempt at
formalization of our Information Conjecture:
Conjecture (2nd attempt). For every universal TM U, we have
T S U ( p T •) for every TM T ∈ T,
where T is a large set of TMs yet to be formalized but intuitively described above. Moreover,
if we denote the simple function that implements the simulation decoding of T by ϕ T , then
the map p T 7→ ϕ T is computable.
We have added another desideratum to the conjecture. Given T’s description p T , a
finite algorithm can actually determine an effective description of the simple function ϕ T
which reads out T’s simulated configuration from U’s. We assume that this algorithm
yields some valid ϕ T for all p T , but the result must only be correct for T ∈ T. This demand
is very natural; not only would we like T’s computation to be in principle determinable
from U’s, but it should generally be known how to actually do so.
If the set of simple functions S is closed under certain operations, we can equivalently
demand that the decoding function is independent of T, i.e., “one simple function reads
them all”:
Lemma 1. Suppose that the set of simple functions S has the following prefix closure property:
for every decidable prefix code { p} labelling a subset of the simple functions { ϕ p } ⊆ S , the function
ϕ : C 0 → C 0,

ϕ p (c) if input tape of c starts with p
ϕ(c) :=
∅
otherwise,
is also contained in S . Then we can without loss of generality assume that for every universal TM
U, there is a unique simple function ϕ ∈ S that implements the simulation decoding for every
TM T.

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

Next we will discuss how to concretely choose a suitable set of simple functions S .
5.3. How Not to Choose the Set of Simple Functions S
It is clear that every rigorous formulation of our conjecture must be false if the set of
simple functions S is “too small”. For example, suppose that we choose S = {id}, i.e.,
define only the identity function to be simple. In this case, T S U ( p T •) implies

CT ( x, t) = CU ( p T x, t) for all x ∈ {0, 1}∗ and all t ∈ N.
However, this is certainly impossible (unless T = U and p T = ε): already at t = 0, the input
tape contents of T and U differ (they hold the strings x and p T x, respectively), hence T and
T 0 have different configurations, and C T ( x, 0) 6= CU ( p T x, 0).
More generally, the following holds:
Lemma 2. If we define S to be minimal, i.e., to only contain the identity function (S = {id}), then
T S T 0 ⇔ C T ( x, t) = C T 0 ( x, t) for all x, t.
That is, TMs formally only ever simulate machines that are exactly identical to themselves in all
their state transitions. In particular, T S T 0 becomes equivalent to T 0 S T.
Note that the right-hand side is not the same as T = T 0 ; for example, T = Ti and T 0 = Tj
for i 6= j from the family of inefficient TMs under Equation (4) will also satisfy it. However,
TMs T and T 0 that satisfy the right-hand side above are “identical for all practical purposes”.
A similar conclusion will follow if we choose the set S non-trivial but still too small; for
our conjecture to be true, S must contain all possible ways in which universal computers
can choose to encode the simulation in their own configuration. In particular, S must
at least contain all “textbook simulation encodings”, such as the one used by Hennie as
described in Section 5.1.
On the other hand, suppose we define S to be the set of all total computable functions
ϕ with ϕ(∅) = ∅. Then this will make our conjecture trivially true for many universal
computers U, but it will in general fail to formalize a sensible notion of simulation, as we
will now demonstrate.
For the sake of the argument, let us assume that there exists some universal TM V that
intuitively violates our Informal Conjecture; it reproduces the outputs of all (or most) other
TMs T in a counterintuitive way that is very different from step-by-step simulation. Let
us construct another universal TM U with U ( x ) = V ( x ) for all x ∈ {0, 1}∗ —it will be a
machine that we obtain by modifying V, and that also violates our Informal Conjecture. It is
constructed in the following way. To obtain the required output functionality, U simulates
V exactly step by step. In addition, U contains a counter on some unused portion of its
work tape, i.e., a representation of a natural number τ that starts in zero and increases by
one after every step of simulation of the TM V. Now we define a total computable function
ϕ via the following algorithm:
•
•

Extract p T and x from the input tape and t from the work tape.
Simulate T on input x for t steps and return the configuration C T ( x, t).

Consequently, we obtain T S U ( p T •) for all TMs T. However, by construction, U never
actually performs any step-by-step simulation of any TM T (since V does not). We have thus
shown the following undesirable feature of the maximal choice of S as the set of all total
computable functions; if there exist universal TMs that violate our Informal Conjecture,
then some of them will still satisfy T S U ( p T •). Thus, ≺S is not a reliable formalization
of the notion of step-by-step simulation that our Informal Observation refers to.
To expose the problem further, consider the following special TM:
Definition 4 (Clock Turing Machine). A clock Turing machine C is a TM that ignores its
input and counts integer time steps t ∈ N on its work tape indefinitely.

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

15 of 22

We are not giving a formal construction of a clock TM, but it is not difficult to think of
a concrete set of internal states and a transition function that implements the clock. For
example, at each time step, the TM may simply write a fixed symbol (say, 1) in the currently
active cell of the work tape and move the work tape head to the right. Since this can be
completed in different ways (e.g., writing only zeros or ones, or alternating in ways that
are determined by changes of the internal state), there are infinitely many clock TMs. Clock
TMs C never halt, i.e., C ( x ) is undefined for every x ∈ {0, 1}∗ .
The construction above shows the following:
Lemma 3. Let C be a clock TM. If we define S to be maximal, i.e., equal to the set of all total
computable functions ϕ with ϕ(∅) = ∅, then
T S C

for every TM T.

That is, the clock TM C will formally be considered to simulate all other TMs step by step.
Most total computable functions are intuitively extremely complex, so the maximal choice
of S is obviously a very bad formalization of a “set of simple functions”. However, the
argument above rules out other, more intuitively sensible choices of S . For example, we
may consider the set S of functions that have at most linear time complexity. A running
time at least linear in the input length is required to read the input, and as we would like
the functions in S to be simple, it is natural to demand that they shall not take significantly
more time than this minimum.
However, we will now argue that even such functions with linear running time can still
be too powerful, as they also allow to apply the clock TM trick. Since we are considering
functions on configurations, we have to be more specific about what we mean by linear
time complexity. For our purpose, we will restrict our attention to the following specific
choice of encoding of configurations and TMs M ϕ that compute ϕ ∈ S . The TM M ϕ is
supposed to satisfy Definition 1, up to a convenient modification; instead of single input,
work, and output tapes, M ϕ has two input tapes (Iin and Iout ), two output tapes (Oin and
Oout ), and four work tapes (Win , Wout , W, and Wstate ).
We use the convention that M ϕ receives the input configuration c ∈ C in the following
way. The tapes and the corresponding head positions will exactly be copied onto the
in-tapes. That is, Iin contains the exact input tape content as described by c, and also its tape
head will be placed at the current position specified by c; similarly for Win and Oin . The
internal state q ∈ Q described by c will be written via dlog2 | Q|e bits onto the tape Wstate .
When M ϕ has halted, the tapes Iout , Wout , and Oout contain the respective tape contents
and tape head positions of the target configuration c0 = ϕ(c), and the tape Wstate contains
the description of the internal state of c0 . If the content of Wstate is not a syntactically correct
description of any q ∈ Q, then the output configuration is taken to be ∅.
Given such ϕ, let us say it has linear time complexity or linear running time if the number
of computation steps of M ϕ is in O(n), where n is the total size of the non-blank blocks on
the initial configuration’s input, work, and output tapes.
We will now show that even those functions are too powerful to represent a meaningful
notion of simple functions. Consider, again, a clock TM C of Lemma 3. Given a TM T that
is supposed to be simulated, we can construct a “simple” function ϕ T via some TM M ϕT as
follows. The TM M ϕT has a set of internal states Q = Q T × Q0 , where the Q0 part is used
to carry its functionally relevant internal state, while Q T carries the representation of an
internal state of T. First, M ϕT copies the input of T from Iin to Iout . Then M ϕT sets the first
component of its internal state equal to the starting state q0 ∈ Q T of T. From that moment
on, M ϕT behaves exactly like T, with Iout as its input tape, Wout as its (initially blank) work
tape, Oout as its (initially blank) output tape, and Q T as state register; we assume that the
transition function of M ϕT contains the transition function of T and uses it for an exact
step-by-step simulation of T. After every simulated time step, M ϕT moves the head on

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

16 of 22

Win to the left. When that head reaches a blank symbol, M ϕT represents the first part of its
internal state via dlog2 | Q T |e bits on the tape Wstate and halts.
The TM M ϕT operates in linear time and maps configurations to configurations. If we
apply M ϕT to the clock TM C, then M ϕT will simulate T for as many steps t as there are
ones on C’s work tape. This clearly produces the configuration C T ( x, t) in linear time. Thus,
ϕ T ∈ S , and we have shown the following:
Lemma 4. Let S be the set of total computable functions (on the configurations) that run in linear
time, in the sense explained above. Then we still have
T S C

for every TM T

if C is any clock TM.
Can stricter time bounds give us a better choice of S ? This seems unlikely, given that at least
linear time is needed to even read the input configuration. So is there another way to define
a set of simple functions S that gives us a non-trivial simulation preorder, but that leaves
some chance for our conjecture (say, in its third formalization) to be true? Unfortunately,
there is a strong counterargument to this hope, as we will now demonstrate.
5.4. An Encryption Counterexample to “Simplicity”
Let us now show that our conjecture cannot hold without substantial modification.
Since a detailed formal proof of what follows seems very cumbersome, we will instead give
an informal argument which we believe is sufficiently detailed to support our conclusion.
Consider some universal TM U of the textbook kind—similarly as Hennie’s universal
TM, U simulates every other TM T step by step. Let us construct a modification of U,
denoted U 0 , that has equivalent input–output behavior as U, i.e., U ( x ) = U 0 ( x ) for all
binary strings x. However, U 0 will encrypt all the parts of T that are not relevant for the
current simulation step. Then functions ϕ ∈ S that deserve the name “simple” will not be
able to crack the encryption of U 0 s representation of T.
To this end, consider some computable function that maps integers n ∈ N to bits
an ∈ {0, 1}. Let us choose a function that is very difficult to evaluate; for example, we may
assume that it takes exponentially many time steps to compute an . More specifically, the
time hierarchy theorems [20] guarantee the existence of a decision problem that cannot be
solved within time O(2n ), but within time O(22n ), and we choose an to be the answer to
such a problem. For negative i, we will use the convention ai := a|i| . We will use this string
of bits for encryption.
Like U, the TM U 0 simulates all elements of T step by step. In particular, it contains
the contents {wi }i∈Z on T’s work tape cells somewhere in its memory. While simulating a
single time step of T, the TM U will read the current tape cells, determine and write their
new contents, and then move the simulated tape heads left or right. We construct U 0 such
that it replaces this one simulated step of operation of T by the following simulation steps
(all tape cells are simulated tape cells):
•

•

•

It reads the symbol in the currently active work tape cell i (assumed unencrypted) and
the other currently active tape cells and applies T’s tabulated transition function δ to
determine whether it has to move left or right on the tapes, and which symbol wi it
has to write into the work tape cell (and similarly for the other tapes).
Then it computes, with a fixed program independent of any other tape content, the
bits ai and ai+σ , where σ = −1 if it has to turn left on the work tape or σ = +1 if it has
to turn right.
It determines wi0 , which is the blank symbol # if wi is blank, and which is wi ⊕ ai if
wi is a bit (encryption). It writes wi0 into work tape cell i and reads wi0+σ from work
tape cell i + σ. It then determines wi+σ , which is the blank symbol # if wi0+σ is blank,
and wi0+σ ⊕ ai+σ otherwise (decryption). The writing onto the input and output tape
is performed without encryption, as determined by T’s transition function δ.

•

U 0 erases all data that results from the computation of ai and ai+σ and of the sums of
those with the work tape bits from other parts of its memory.

We assume that the TM U 0 is constructed such that the only relevant difference after the
encryption resp. decryption step to before is the value of the simulated work cell bit. In
other words, U 0 is supposed to “erase all the garbage” that it produced while computing ai ,
leaving only a simple encoding of the encrypted configuration of T. We also assume that
U 0 does not contain an explicit counter of the number of time steps that have passed since
the start of the computation.
Let s1 , s2 , s3 , . . . label the times at which the TM U 0 has completed simulating (as
described above) the first, second, and third. . . step of computation of T. Now suppose that
the current formalization of our conjecture (second attempt) is true, for some intuitively
reasonable set of simple functions S . Then there is some ϕ0 ∈ S and an increasing sequence
of times {τt0 }t such that
ϕ0 (CU 0 ( p T x, τt0 )) = C T ( x, t)
(5)
for all t, and such that ϕ0 (CU 0 ( p T x, s)) = ∅ for all s 6∈ {τt0 }t . A priori, the times τt0 need
not at all be related to the simulation times st . For example, ϕ0 could act similarly as the
function that we have used to prove Lemma 3; it could simply perform the simulation of T
itself, without having to wait for U 0 to have finished its simulation steps. Then we could
have, for example, that τt0 = t, but st will grow exponentially with t.
However, such functions ϕ are not of the form that we have in mind in any intuitive
formulation of our conjecture. Let us, therefore, assume that the set of simple functions
S does comply with out intuition to some extent; the simple functions shall not simulate T by
themselves, but shall only read what has already been simulated by the universal TM U 0 . Intuitively,
the simulated configuration C T ( x, t) is generated (in encrypted form) at time st on U 0 and
not before. Thus, our assumption amounts to postulating that the times τt0 must essentially
be on or after the times st when U 0 has performed the tth step of simulation of T:
Assumption 1. There is a possible choice of ϕ0 such that there exists at least one x, such that
st ≤ τt0 < st+1 for many different t.
Note that we are not assuming that this has to hold for all TMs T. We only need to
assume that there exists at least one TM T within the “sufficiently diverse” set of TMs
(as mentioned in the second attempt of formalization of our conjecture) that satisfies this
assumption and the other two below.
In other words, for many t, the simple function ϕ0 has to read out C T ( x, t) within the
time interval [st , st+1 − 1]—this may not be true for all simple functions that read out T’s
configuration, but we assume that it is true for some ϕ0 .
Now, via Equation (5), let us analyze what this means for such ϕ0 . Consider one of
the “many different t” from Assumption 1. Then the simple function ϕ0 has to determine
CT ( x, t) from some CU 0 ( p T x, s), where st ≤ s < st+1 . What do these configurations of
U 0 look like? For s = st , this configuration consists of a simple encoding of C T ( x, t)∗ , by
which we denote C T ( x, t) with all work tape bits but one encrypted. This is basically it, by
construction, U 0 does not contain more information than that (except for, say, a constant
set of instructions that allows U 0 to compute any ai or to decode the transition function δT
from p T etc.).
Over the next time steps, for st < s < st+1 , the TM U 0 computes ai and ai+σ and uses
this to encode and to decode the currently and next active cell on T’s simulated work tape.
Over all these time steps, U 0 will thus contain a simple encoding of T’s configuration with
all work tape bits but at most two encrypted—let us denote this by C T ( x, t)∗∗ —and some
“rest”. This “rest” contains, for example, intermediate results of the computation of ai and
ai+σ , but it does not contain any information of substantial help in decrypting any of the
other work tape bits. Schematically, we may thus write

CU 0 ( p T x, s) = CT ( x, t)∗∗ , rest ,

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

18 of 22

and the above remarks motivate us to formulate the following
Assumption 2. Computing C T ( x, t) from CU 0 ( p T x, s) is essentially equivalent to computing it
from C T ( x, t)∗∗ —in this sense, the “rest” can be ignored.
However, now, recalling Equation (5), we find that ϕ0 essentially has to map C T ( x, t)∗∗
onto C T ( x, t)—it seems like this means that ϕ0 has to decrypt all but two of T’s work tape
bits, which is a Herculean task if the work tape contains many bits.
Or does it really have to? Note that there may be indirect ways of determining C T ( x, t)
from C T ( x, t)∗∗ without actually doing any decryption. For example, suppose that T = C is
the clock TM from Definition 4. Then C T ( x, t) has a sequence of t identical ones on its work
tape (followed by blank tapes). This configuration can be determined by simply counting
how many non-blank symbols are on the work tape of C T ( x, t)∗∗ , and then by replacing
each bit by a one.
However, the clock TM is very special. In contrast, think of a TM T with the property
that the configuration C T ( x, t) differs, for a large set of values of t (and identical x), only in
the content of the work tape bits. (For example, T could simply count integers in binary
on the work tape for a very large number of time steps, without modifying other parts of
its configuration.) Then, the only way to determine C T ( x, t) from C T ( x, t)∗∗ would be by
brute-force decryption.
Assumption 3. T writes many bits onto its work tape and has the property that C T ( x, t) can, for
many x and t, essentially only be determined by brute force decryption of C T ( x, t)∗∗ .
Then we obtain the following consequence.
Observation 2. If the above informal argumentation can be made rigorous (including, in particular, the three assumptions), then our conjecture (in its second attempt of formalization) can
only be correct if we allow the set of simple functions S to contain maps that are intuitively
extremely complex.
5.5. From Simplicity to Preservation of Structure
Our goal was to find a formalization of the idea that all functionally relevant elements of T
must typically be fully represented within U—a formulation that is non-trivial and has a chance
to be true. However, it seems that we have tried to do so in the wrong way, demanding
that T’s configuration can be read from U’s with some function that is simple to implement
is doomed to fail—at least if we understand simplicity as small time complexity. On the
one hand, Observation 2 suggests that S must necessarily contain very complex functions
to break the encryption of some universal TMs. On the other hand, Lemma 4 shows that
even very small time complexity already admits functions that “cheat” by performing the
simulation themselves.
Note that putting a time bound on admissible read-out functions is similar to the
strategy by Zwirn and Delahaye [11,12] to define “approximations” of Turing machines in
their approach to construct a formal definition of computational irreducibility. The above
shows that our approach to define computational sourcehood (and its typicality) needs a
different strategy.
For a different perspective, consider again the example of the clock TM of Lemma 4.
Why should we regard functions ϕ ∈ S that implement the simulation by themselves as
“undesired” or “cheating”? Our previous attempt was to say that such ϕ are not simple in
any meaningful sense of the word. However there is an alternative view, we can also say
that such ϕ are not sufficiently structure-preserving.
To see this, let us contrast such “cheating” ϕ with typical read-out functions ψ for
textbook universal TMs like Hennie’s. Consider two configurations c, c0 ∈ C of a simulated
TM T that are in some sense “pretty close to each other”—perhaps they differ only in a small
number of bits on the work tape, but are otherwise identical. Consider some configuration

Entropy 2023, 25, 903

that represent the simulated bits differing between c and c0 ) to obtain cU
U
In contrast, the “cheating” ϕ for the clock TM C will not, in general, satisfy this property; there will be close-by configurations c = C T ( x, t) and c0 = C T ( x 0 , t0 ) with c = ϕ(cC ),
0 with c0 = ϕ ( c0 ) are very far away from c . To see this,

let T be a universal TM. For every input x ∈ {0, 1}∗ , denote by t H ( x ) T’s halting time
on input x (which is ∞ if it does not halt on that input). Furthermore, for those x with
t H ( x ) < ∞, denote by N ( x ) the smallest i ∈ N, such that the ith output tape cell is blank at
halting; in other words, this means that the TM halts with a block of N ( x ) non-blank bits
on its output tape; for non-halting x, set N ( x ) := −1. Then Nn := maxx∈{0,1}n N ( x ) grows
extremely fast—similarly to the busy beaver function [26], it must grow faster than every
computable function, due to the undecidability of the halting problem. For every n, pick
an arbitrary maximizing input xn , i.e., N ( xn ) = Nn and `( xn ) = n. Then the configuration
cn := C T ( xn , t H ( xn )) contains an extremely large (of size Nn ) block of bits on its output tape.
(i )

For every i ∈ [0, Nn ], denote by cn the configuration cn with the ith bit on the output tape

inverted. In other words, cn differs from every cn in only a single bit. Now, by definition
of ϕ and of the clock TM,
cn = ϕ(CC ( xn , t H ( xn ))) = ϕ(cn,C ),
where cn,C := CC ( xn , t H ( xn )). Let us estimate the number of configurations c0n,C that have
distance at most k from cn,C , where k ∈ N \ {0}, i.e., the number of elements in the k-ball
Bk (cn,C ). We have not formally defined a distance measure on the configurations yet, and
our argumentation will not be particularly sensitive to the choice of measure. Nonetheless,
for concreteness, let us define
D (CC ( x, t), CC ( x 0 , t0 )) := D H ( x̄, x̄ 0 ) + |`( x ) − `( x 0 )| + |t − t0 |,
where x̄ and x̄ 0 denote the first m bits of x resp. x 0 , where m := min{`( x ), `( x 0 )}, and D H
is the Hamming distance. (All other configurations will be mapped to ∅ by ϕ, hence we
are not interested in them). Clearly, D (CC ( x 0 , t0 ), cn,C ) ≤ k implies |t0 − t H ( xn )| ≤ k and
`( x 0 ) ≤ `( x ) + k. There are (2k + 1) many choices of such t0 and 2n+k many choices of such
x 0 . Since 2k + 1 < 22k ,
| Bk (cn,C )| < 2n+3k .
Now let k n := b 31 (log2 Nn − n)c, which still grows faster in n then every computable
(i )

function. By simple counting, there must be at least one i ∈ [0, Nn ], such that ϕ(c̃) 6= cn
for every c̃ ∈ Bk (cn,C ); there are simply not enough configurations in the k-ball to cover all
(i )

(i )

cn . Hence, for every n there exists some i, such that D (cn , cn ) = 1 and cn = ϕ(cn,C ), but
(i )

(i )

(i )

cn = ϕ(cn,C ) ⇒ D (cn,C , cn,C ) > k n ,
where k n grows extremely quickly in n. Hence, ϕ is not structure-preserving in the way
explained above.
This motivates our final attempt of formalizing our conjecture:
Conjecture (third and final attempt). For every universal TM U, we have
T S U ( p T •) for every TM T ∈ T,
where S is a natural set of structure-preserving maps on TM configurations.
By structure-preserving maps, as sketched above, we mean functions ϕ with the following
property. If we have close-by configurations c and c0 , and another configuration cU with

ϕ(cU ) = c, then there is another configuration cU

U
functions are not necessarily assumed to be “easy to implement”.
It is not clear whether (and perhaps even unlikely that) the best definition of “close-by”
is similar to the one used above, i.e., based on a distance measure between configurations
that is essentially some modification of the Hamming distance. It may well be that it is more
suitable to introduce a form of “functional similarity”, perhaps a notion that is allowed
to depend on the Turing machine under consideration. It is hence likely that higher-level
mathematical tools, perhaps from category theory, are needed to substantiate this attempt.
Whether the above attempt can be made rigorous in some such way will have to be seen in
future work.

6. Conclusions
In this article, we have revisited the idea that computer science notions, such as
computational irreducibility [10], can shed light on the relation between determinism
and free agency [1]. We have addressed two issues with previous proposals of this kind:
first, Wolfram’s original proposal did not include a rigorous mathematical definition of
computational irreducibility, and it is unclear whether later definitions, such as those by
Zwirn and Delahaye [11,12], are well-suited to reason specifically about free agency. Second,
as argued also by Bringsjord [15], the focus of Wolfram’s (and Lloyd’s [14]) approach on the
question of temporal shortcuts allows us to reason about unpredictability as a phenomenon of
free agency, but not directly about the question of whether agents’ decisions are actually free.
Motivated by a simple thought experiment (“John the cook”, cf. Figure 1), we have
proposed a variant of computational irreducibility, termed computational sourcehood, that
is intended to formalize an aspect of actual free agency more directly. We suggest that
a process P can be regarded as the source of its outputs if attempts to reproduce them
must typically involve a step-by-step simulation that contains replicas of the history of
configurations of P. While this notion is closely related to computational irreducibility (in
particular, it also implies that there are typically no shortcuts to simulating P), it makes a
more general claim, by stipulating that even slow and inefficient simulations must typically
contain “clones” of the process.
We have then taken up the challenge to give a rigorous mathematical formulation
of this phenomenon and its conjectured typicality. This has led us to a question about
universal Turing machines (TMs), defined by their ability to reproduce the input–output
behavior of all other TMs T; is it true that all universal TMs work by essentially simulating
T step by step, except for a small subset of TMs T for which they know shortcuts? While this
question—and the conjecture of a positive answer to it—can easily be described in words,
it turns out to be quite difficult to find a rigorous formulation that is non-trivial and has a
chance to be true.
Our first idea of formalization was to say that U simulates T step by step if the temporal
sequence of configurations of T can be read out from the sequence of configurations of U
via some “simple function”. We have shown that this is true for textbook constructions
of universal TMs, such as Hennie’s [18], but we have identified obstructions to proving
that this must be true in general. On the one hand, we have sketched a universal TM that
encrypts most of the simulated data, which shows that read-out functions cannot always be
intuitively simple; on the other hand, we have shown via a “clock TM” that formally simple
read-out functions can have unintended functionality (namely, perform the simulation
themselves) that leads to a trivial notion of simulation.
These insights have led us to formulate a version of our conjecture that defines simulation not in terms of simple, but structure-preserving functions; close-by configurations of the
simulated TM T should be represented by close-by configurations of the simulating TM
U. While we were not able to suggest a rigorous definition of “close-by”, we have shown
that its simplest implementation leads to a notion of simulation that is not trivialized by
the clock TM example. Whether this formulation of the conjecture can indeed be made
rigorous in an interesting way will have to be seen in future work.

While we were not able to settle our conjecture, we think that its study might lead to
interesting insights into the nature of universal computation, regardless of whether it turns
out to be true and independently of its relation to free agency. We hope that our results and
constructions can motivate further interesting inquiries into the relation of computation
and freedom.

Temporal Direction, Intuitionism and Physics
Yuval Dolev
Department of Philosophy, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan 5290002, Israel; dolevyu@biu.ac.il

Abstract: In a recent paper, Nicolas Gisin suggests that by conducting physics with intuitionistic rather
than classical mathematics, rich temporality—that is, passage and tense, and specifically the future’s
openness—can be incorporated into physics. Physics based on classical mathematics is tenseless
and deterministic, and that, so he holds, renders it incongruent with experience. According to Gisin,
physics ought to represent the indeterminate nature of reality, and he proposes that intuitionistic
mathematics is the key to succeeding in doing so. While I share his insistence on the reality of passage
and tense and on the future being real and open, I argue that the amendment he offers does not work.
I show that, its attunement to time notwithstanding, intuitionistic mathematics is as tenseless as
classical mathematics and that physics is bound to remain tenseless regardless of the math it employs.
There is much to learn about tensed time, but the task belongs to phenomenology and not to physics.

The premise of this paper is simple, though controversial: the nature of time cannot be
fully captured by either mathematics or physics. While physics provides theories about
occurrences in time, it cannot address the essence of time itself. Temporal asymmetry,
specifically the difference between futurity and pastness, which is so central to our experience of being in the world, is bound to remain outside the domain of physics and
mathematics. On the positive side, phenomenology offers a wealth of insights into the
nature of time—perhaps all the insights we may want.
Controversial, perhaps, yet these claims are not new. Recently, however, a novel
suggestion was put forth for devising a formal framework wherein time and the future’s
openness are integral. In a nutshell, the idea is to replace time-blind classical mathematics
with temporally sensitive intuitionistic mathematics when doing physics. The claim is that
physics conducted with this new mathematics will also be temporal in a way that physics
as we know it is not.
However, I argue that, to the extent that temporality is part of intuitionistic mathematics, it is found there in precisely the same way that it has always been part of physics—as
an accompaniment that is indispensable but external to physics, as part of the language
and conceptual background that scientific research presupposes and within which it takes
place. Thus, as far as having experienced temporality expressed in physics is concerned,
the proposed replacement of the mathematical framework leaves matters as they were.
The upshot is that time and specifically the temporal asymmetry between the past and
the future remain something for which, as Einstein put it, “physics has no possibility of
expression” (in a 1952 letter to Ms. Levitova). Tensed temporality turns out to be a matter
for phenomenological rather than scientific research. The implications for physicalism are
clear and immediate. However, there are further implications for the current preoccupation
with the potential sentience of machines.

2. The A-Temporal Nature of Classical Mathematics
Two facts about classical calculus must be considered when its application in physics
is analyzed: it is a-temporal and it deals with infinities. Both these facts are important
for understanding how time figures in physics and both are incongruent with the reality
physics is concerned with, which is temporal and finite.
In an important paper, “Indeterminism in Physics, Classical Chaos and Bohmian
Mechanics: Are Real Numbers Really Real?”, Nicholas Gisin [1] shows how the prejudice
that physics is deterministic follows from a reliance on real numbers and real (and complex)
analysis in describing reality. Real numbers, with the exception of countably many of
them, are infinite entities that cannot have a finite representation (the rational numbers
are countable and, of the irrational
√ ones, again, only countably many can be represented
by finite symbols such as π or 2). In a nutshell, Gisin’s argument is that the contention
that the equations of motion are deterministic, namely, that, given a system, its state at
t1 is uniquely determined by its state at t0 , presupposes that the system’s state at t0 can
be described with infinite accuracy. However, that is never the case. Given the laws of
motion, if a system’s state at t0 is described only with finite accuracy, then that state is
compatible with a multitude of states at t1 . In his paper, Gisin shows how the supposed
determinism of classical mechanics is achieved by formulating it with infinite entities—the
real numbers—in much the same manner that quantum physics is rendered deterministic
in Bohmian mechanics by means of hidden variables.
This—the removal of an open future from its portrayal of reality—is the first divergence
of physics from experienced temporality. However, matters are worse, for the fact that
classical mathematics is a-temporal entails that physics does not capture any notion of
futurity, open or not. The same is true of course for presentness and pastness. To quote
Einstein in full this time, “physics . . . has no possibility of expression for ‘now’ (present),
for ‘past’ and for ‘future’”. Given the state of a system at t0 , the laws of motion enable
establishing its state at any other time t1. However, these laws and, indeed, nothing in
the theory, tells where the system is now. Being told the precise time of a solar eclipse
(e.g., 29 March 2025) will not enable you to see it, unless you know what time it is now. And
nothing in the theories of physics holds this information. Indeed, the irremediable absence
of tense from physics is part of the reason why eternalism is so popular with philosophers
of time that draw their understanding of reality from science.
However, physics’ tribulations with time are not over, for it is not clear that even the
tenseless earlier/later dichotomy, which expresses a much thinner conception of temporal
directionality than the one embodied by tense and passage (by passage I mean the becoming
of future events present and of present ones past), is captured by physics. In the above
references to the state of a system at t1 it was not stated, nor did it have to be stated, whether
t1 was earlier or later than t0 . The natural numbers are no more temporally arranged when
they serve as indexes for t as they are when used to count apples (that the laws of nature
are so-called “time reversal invariant” is one expression of this fact.).
Without the second law of thermodynamics, physics cannot make this distinction.
However, even with this law, in its thermodynamic, not mechanical statistical form, what
we obtain is a directed sequence of events, not necessarily one that is correlated with
temporal direction. Moreover, in its statistical form, the question of the direction in which
systems evolve becomes a matter of probability, and this is certainly at odds with temporal
direction, which exhibits no such sensitivity to statistics.
To sum up, physics is mute when it comes to time: it cannot express tense and
passage, knows nothing of the future and of its openness, has no means to represent which
moment or which event is taking place now, and does not have within its vocabulary the
asymmetry between before and after, the static, tenseless form of temporal directionality.
In addition, and relatedly, physics seems to give credence to determinism. And the source
of its limitations seems to be the a-temporal, infinite mathematical language its theories
are construed with (My study [2] is devoted to a detailed discussion of the absence of
tense and passage from physics. It also discusses the so-called tenseless relations and

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

3 of 11

claims that, given how these depend on tense and passage, they too are not part of physics.
My study [3] concerns the second law of thermodynamics. I show there that it assumes
temporal directionality rather than ground it.).
This line of reasoning has led Gisin to the idea that a different mathematical language,
one closely tied to time and which shuns the problematic, unconstructive infinities of
classical calculus, could alter matters significantly and empower physics to incorporate
temporality like it never did before.
3. Intuitionistic Mathematics
The framework that is supposed to facilitate this advancement is intuitionistic mathematics, which, as Gisin puts it, “allows one to re-enchant physics, introducing a model of
an objective “creative” time, i.e., a dynamical time that allows for an open future and the
passage of time” [4].
The hallmark of intuitionism is that, in contrast with realism/Platonism, which takes
mathematical entities to be outside of time and immutable, the objects of intuitionistic
mathematics evolve as time passes. Intuitionism seems to have the openness of the future
built into it: at any given moment the domain of mathematical objects consists only of what
has hitherto been constructed, with more to be added as time goes on. The openness of the
future consists in the fact that, at present, there is no fact of the matter as to what will be added.
Formally, the law of excluded middle (henceforth, LEM) does not apply to propositions
describing these future elements.
Brouwer’s choice sequences are a quintessence of the constructivist, indeterminate
understanding of mathematical objects. Here is Posy’s description of them:
A choice sequence, σ, is given by a preset finite initial segment, σ(1), . . ., σ(k), together
with a rule that, given (1), . . ., (k), determines the range of possible values for σ(k + 1) and
onward. The rule might allow but a single value of σ(k + 1) for each k. That is an algorithm.
But it might very well allow a broad collection of possible values. Given σ(1), . . ., σ(k), the
set of available values of σ(k + 1) will be fully calculable ([5], p. 27).
Indeterminacy enters the picture with the fact that before a “creating subject” makes
the choice, it is not determined which of all possible values for the next element of the
sequence will actually become the sequence’s continuation (To be accurate, indeterminacy
having to do with a creating subject is an intermediate between the indeterminacy found
in absolutely free-choice lawless sequences and lawlike, algorithmic sequences. For an
elaboration see Posy (2020), a superb introduction to intuitionism, in which it is presented
in all its depth and thrill. Brouwer’s “creating subject” is discussed in Posy ([5], p. 28).).
It is worth noting the striking resemblance this bears to the standard understanding of
quantum mechanics, in which the wave function represents all possible outcomes of a
future measurement, but, prior to the measurement, there is no fact of the matter as to
which result will actually be obtained. That is determined only when the measurement, the
parallel of the choice made by a “creating subject”, is made.
Intuitionistic mathematics, then, appears to be genuinely temporal, with an open,
indeterminate future figuring among its constitutive elements. It is exactly the kind of
mathematics, which, if rendered adequate for physics, would emancipate physics from
determinism and from its timelessness.
Alas, the hope for temporalizing physics in this manner is short lived. As an evolving
system that develops over time, intuitionistic math is indeed temporal, but only in a limited
manner. To see what this means, let us begin by noting that intuitionism can, without
omission of any content, be formulated tenselessly; that is, it can be fully articulated with
no use of the word “future”, and so with no reference to the future’s openness.
As just noted, choice sequences are the embodiments of constructions in time. At
some initial moment t0 the sequence begins with a preset segment, and then, with time,
it grows: at t1 an element s1 is added, at t2 another element s2 , s3 at t3 , and so on. At t1 it
is undetermined which of all possible values for s2 will in fact be chosen, that is, at t1 the
law of excluded middle does not apply to the proposition “s2 is Ω” (Ω being a member

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

4 of 11

of the set of values s2 can assume), hence the indeterminism. However, notice that in this
formulation there is no mention of the future. We can say that at t1 the later moment t2 is
future. We can say that the sequence “grows” as time passes. However, these appeals to
tense and passage are just a manner of speaking. They add nothing to what has already
been stated in a tenseless language.
A comparison with the tenseless analysis of motion can help clarify how in this case
the employment of tensed language only covers up the fact that the thesis being put forth
is tenseless through and through. Eternalists do not deny the reality of motion, that, for
example, there are busses that travel from Boston to NY. However, for eternalists, that
only means that, focusing on some particular bus, at t1 the bus is in Boston, at a later time
t2 it is in Harford, etc., until finally at tk it is in NY. In this analysis of motion (known as
Cambridge, or, sometimes, Russell motion) there is no passage, no past, present, or future.
It is important to note that eternalists do not shun tensed language—it is standard linguistic
practice, when the bus is in Hartford, to say that it will get to NY in three hours. The
so-called “New B-theory” was devised precisely for the purpose of reconciling eternalism
with the fact that the tenses are not removable from language and are not dispensable. The
point is, however, that that is where the tenses are found—in language and psychology, not
in the world.
Intuitionism works with the exact same tenseless conception of change and evolution.
That the tenses are used while laying it out does not mean they have a role in it. Intuitionists can avow their conviction that mathematical structures develop with time and
make reference to time’s passage, but these uses of tense are optional add-ons that can be
dispensed with and do not render intuitionism tensed any more than the employment of
tense by eternalists (“the bus will reach its destination in one hour”) makes their theory of
motion tensed. For intuitionism to be tensed, the tenses have to be indispensable to it, to be
irremovable from its propositions, which they are not. To the contrary, the now is absent,
and cannot be inserted into it. We know what the state of things is now, e.g., where the bus
is now, or how many digits in the decimal expansion of π are currently known. However,
theories can only tell us how things stand at a given moment t; they cannot tell us whether t
is present, or past, or future. What time it is now, today’s date, is not information that we
can glean from, or insert into, any theory.
Posy states that intuitionism’s temporality is deeply tensed and therefore nondeterministic: “Ips’s [infinitely proceeding sequence, such as choice sequences] show this. Grasping
an ips α is the paradigm temporal experience, a clear sense of past, present and future.
a’s fixed initial segment is the clear past. The information we have at Σ0a (the moment
of grasp) defines the present. And the rule for choosing α’s further elements is what we
can say of the future. And that future is palpably indeterminate: the rule need not be an
algorithm” ([5], p. 81).
However, far from establishing intuitionism’s temporality, what this passage offers is
a glowing instance of how a superficial glaze of tensed vocabulary can create the illusion
that a theory is tensed while in truth it is thoroughly tenseless. Just note how readily this
passage can be rephrased so that no mention is made of the past, present, or future. All the
passage says is that grasping an ips α at a given moment t consists of grasping an initial
segment which is already fixed before t, as well as information added at t, and a rule for
choosing α’s further elements at subsequent moments. No allusion to a “clear past”, a
present, or a future is required. We could call the later moments future if we so chose, but
that is just like calling the arrival of the bus in NY “future”—a use of words that would not
for one minute shake an eternalist’s conviction regarding the tenselessness of motion.
In intuitionism, just as in Cambridge change, temporal evolution is captured by the
relativization of a property to a tenseless moment in time. In the case of motion, the property
in question is spatial location. For intuitionism, it is the possession of a truth value by a
proposition. A truth value can be attached to a token at a time t in the way that a spatial
location x is assigned to the bus at a time t. In both, tense and passage are completely out of
the picture. Imagine that a proof of Goldbach’s conjecture is found in 2050. The conjecture’s

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

5 of 11

status at that moment changes from being neither true nor false to being true. That is what
happened to Fermat’s conjecture in 1995. However, the entire sequence of events regarding
Goldbach’s conjecture can be given tenselessly: in 1742 Christian Goldbach puts forth the
conjecture that every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes. In
1924 Hardy and Littlewood show that. . . in 1930 Lev Schnirelmann shows that. . .. In 1951
Yuri Linnik proves that. . .in 2050 so-and-so proves the conjecture. Again, before 2050 the
conjecture lacks a truth value, while from 2050 onwards it possesses a truth value. Can
a Martian who is given this information know whether the conjecture has been proven
or refuted, whether it now has a truth value? Only if they know what date it is today, but
this piece of information has to be provided in addition to the above chronology of the
conjecture’s evolution.
The analogy between Cambridge change and intuitionism may be objected to. It
could be claimed that spatial locations and truth values are categorically very different.
The former are properties of material objects, the latter are rather abstract properties
of propositions. The change a proposition undergoes is from lacking a truth value to
possessing one, whereas a bus in motion always has a spatial location. However, this
difference is irrelevant in the present context. The similarity is important and consists in
a change in properties, which is given in tenseless terms, without the now figuring in its
depiction. This both cases share.
4. How Time Figures in Intuitionism and in Physics
I should emphasize that I take the tenseless theory of change and motion to be incoherent (my reasons are presented in several publications.). Regarding mathematics, my leaning
is towards realism. My aim here, however, is not to present objections to intuitionism, only
to clarify in which manner exactly it incorporates temporality. I want to show that the time
that figures in it is tenseless time, just as in the tenseless theory of motion. One consequence
of this will be that even if physics is reformulated with intuitionistic mathematics (what
this could mean will be discussed shortly), tense and passage are still external to it.
The tenseless character of intuitionism is harder to detect, for, unlike eternalism, which
celebrates tenselessness and proudly highlights the contrast between the tensed nature of
the experience of motion and what the theory contends is the truth—namely, that motion is
a tenseless affair—intuitionism purports to be a theory in which rich, tensed temporality
figures centrally in both the epistemology and the ontology of mathematics.
However, the deeper reason why the tenselessness of intuitionism is evasive is that
we are in tensed time, living in the present, with a past behind us and a future before us.
Regardless of our metaphysical convictions, we cannot but experience, think, and speak of
events and occurrences as located in either the past, present, or future. As committed as we
may be to eternalism and/or determinism, the sun’s rising tomorrow morning cannot but
be apprehended by us as future. If we think of tomorrow’s game, we cannot but experience
its futurity as open. An eternalist, who is writing a paper establishing that tense is an
illusion, cannot but experience that activity as occurring in the present and the paper’s
publication as future. Tense imbues our cognition, experience, and language through and
through. Our natural, pre-reflective stance is that things—our experiences and thoughts
as well as the events we experience and think about—are in tensed time. Tenselessness
is foreign to our thinking and experience, it is so far removed from them that it is far
from obvious that we can wrap our heads around it—in any context. It takes effort and
argumentation to so much as suggest that motion is not in tensed time. Moreover, when a
theory comes along purporting to couch mathematics in time, the time figuring in it will
be natural time, time as we know it from experience—flowing and consisting of a past,
present, and future. We know no other time. Other than as a construction of philosophers,
we do not know what tenseless time is. We may resist the temporalization of math, but to
the extent that we entertain the possibility, the time figuring in this attempt will be time as
we know it—tensed and passing. It would be all but expected that when Posy lays out the
principles of intuitionism, he will speak of “a clear past, present and future”.

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

But there is no tense or passage in the time of intuitionism. We project our notion
of time on the temporality of intuitionism. However, like in a failed organ transplant,
intuitionism cannot absorb time. Time as we know it remains external to it. We cognize
the development of a choice sequence as something with a past, present, and future, but
this temporality resides in the world and in how we experience it. It is no more part of
intuitionistic mathematics than it is of Newtonian physics. The tenseless theory of time
came into being in the beginning of the 20th century in the work of McTaggart [6] and
then received a significant boost with the appearance of Einstein’s relativity theory. Before
that, no one thought of physics as tenseless, yet physics was always tenseless—tense and
passage were never part of it. It is just that, in the absence of a tenseless theory of time, no
one thought of physics as tenseless. The distinction between experienced time and time as
it figures in a theory was not made explicit or noticed. Similarly, no such distinction was
made regarding intuitionism. However, rich temporality is external to intuitionism just as
it is to Newtonian physics.
Contrast this with tenseless relations. A line—the time coordinate—can represent
these relations. The distance between the tick marks on the line represents a time interval
of a certain duration (That tenseless relations can be represented spatially goes hand in
hand with other elements in the spatialization of space that are integral to eternalism.). But
what could a representation of tense and passage look like? How could it be achieved? No
diagram of phase space comes with a moving dot that indicates the state of the system
now. There is no, and cannot be, an equivalent of such a dot in any theory of physics (A
fact that “worried him seriously”, as Einstein confessed to Carnap [7], p. 37–38.). So, what
could turn the trick? Merely being situated in time, perhaps even with an open future, is
not enough. There is a difference between being something and representing that thing.
An emoji can represent happiness but is not itself happy, while Jane is happy but is not
a representation of happiness. Say we follow Anscombe and think of a Galton board
as a system with an open future—Anscombe persuasively makes the point that viewing
the board as a system whose trajectory is deterministically necessitated in advance is a
matter of choice, not a position imposed on us by physics or by logic or by conceptual
analysis. Still, even if the board evolves into an open future, it instantiates time’s passage,
it does not represent it. Intuitionism is a philosophical theory that says that the body of
mathematical facts and knowledge grows with time’s passage and has an open future.
In this respect, it is just like presentism that says of, say, a Galton board that it evolves
with time’s passage and has an open future. However, the framework intuitionism is
about—intuitionistic mathematics—does not represent tense and time’s passage any more
than a Galton board does.
The source of confusion is found in the conflation of intuitionism as a philosophical
theory about math and intuitionistic mathematics. As a system of mathematics, it can be
formulated in purely tenseless terms. Proofs of theorems in intuitionistic mathematics are
written down in notebooks just like proofs in classical math. Nothing on the page in which
such a proof is laid out represents time’s passage or the now. It is the philosophical doctrine
that says of intuitionistic mathematics that it is in time, that it evolves as time passes, and
that it has an open future, and the philosophical doctrine is external to the mathematical
activity it speaks of, looking at it and commenting on it from the outside, as it were.
Gisin’s proposal is, of course, not to replace classical math as it figures in physics
with a philosophical doctrine of intuitionism but with intuitionistic mathematics itself.
However, that would amount to replacing one tenseless mathematical formalism with
another that is just as tenseless. True, of this formalism it can be said that it is the outcome
of an activity that takes place in tense time, but that is of no help insofar as inserting tense
into the theories of physics is concerned, because the mathematical formalism figuring in
the theories continues to be tenseless.
To sum up, that there is a philosophical doctrine that views the mathematical landscape
as evolving with time’s passage does not facilitate inserting time’s passage into physics.
Tense and passage, central to the reality physics describes, remain external to it, no matter

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

7 of 11

with which mathematical framework the theory is formulated. That, of course, does not
mean that tense and passage are not part of reality. Physics is utterly compatible with tense
and passage, but they are not part of it.
Theories in general, and those of physics in particular, can impart much temporal
information, but they cannot tell us what of all that is described in them is happening now.
The now is an experiential given, which cannot be read off from any device, let alone from
any theory. Even a clock does not tell that it is now, rather, it tells that it is now 5 pm, that
is, it conjoins a calendrical time with a now that is already apprehended experientially.
That tense and passage belong to the fundamental structure of reality was not even
questionable prior to the appearance of eternalism. There were no eternalists in the 18th and
19th century, and the thought that tense and passage were not part of reality did not occur
to any physicist back then. It is just that tense and passage resided in how people spoke,
experienced, thought, and behaved, not in their theories. The development of intuitionistic
mathematics did not change this, it did not bring with it a novel manner of relating physics
to tense and passage. Also now, the only way to “temporalize” physics is by an external
indicator, a laser pointer, for example, which superimposes the present on the appropriate
location in a coordinate system.
In any theory, time is represented by a tenseless timeline. It is incumbent upon us
to infuse it, from the outside, with temporality—we can always highlight a point on a
timeline and say that is where the present is located, but this extra act remains external
to the representation. The same can be done with intuitionism. A diagram in which the
various possibilities for the next element in a sequence are shown to branch off from the
last element added to the sequence supposedly depicts the future’s openness, but here
again tense and passage are utterly absent.
5. The Future’s Openness
That the future is open is not important in itself. The significance of the future’s
openness is tied, for us, to deliberation, often, to the need to choose between possibilities.
However, this notion of possibilities is a longstanding conceptual challenge.
Before discussing it briefly, the meagerness of intuitionism’s temporality should be
highlighted from another angle. Even if in intuitionistic mathematics the future is open,
that does not immediately entail that intuitionistic mathematics knows of multiple future
possibilities. That Goldbach’s conjecture lacks a truth value on 1 June 2022 does not logically
necessitate that there is a possibility that it will be refuted at some moment later than 1
June 2022. In general, that at t1 proposition p, which speaks of an event that takes place at a
later moment t2 , lacks a truth value does not presuppose or dictate that there are multiple
possibilities for what may happen at t2 . A proposition may lack a truth value in the way a
tree lacks leaves in the winter: at a later date the tree will grow leaves and the proposition
(or, to be accurate, a later token of it) will attain a truth value. That things “change” in this
manner does not mean they could have changed in a different way. On 1 June 2022 there is
neither a proof of Goldbach’s conjecture nor a counterexample, and so it lacks a truth value,
but, assuming a proof is produced at a later date, that on 1 June 2022 there is a genuine
possibility of finding a counterexample is a further claim, which is not entailed by the mere
absence of a truth-value. Intuitionism holds that mathematics evolves with time, but that is
not tantamount to ascertaining that there really are multiple alternative futures. If so, the
gap between intuitionism and eternalism is smaller than it may appear to be.
This last observation brings us back to the limitations on representing time, limitations
stemming from issues concerning the ontology of possibilities. Future possibilities, do
they exist? In what manner? Do they co-exist in the future, side by side, as it were?
Sometimes that is how they are depicted, as lines branching out from a point—“the present”
(Bergson’s [8] scathing criticism of this picture is as valid today as it was when he made it.).
Picturing these future possibilities in this manner begs the question—how is the one that
will end up being actualized different from those that will not? Those that will not become

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

8 of 11

actual will never come into being, and they are not part of reality now. So, in what sense do
they exist at all?
These ancient questions cannot be broached here. The point is that, no matter how we
think they should be approached, it is plain that answers will not come from representations
of physical systems or from mathematical frameworks. Nor would the stance we end up
adopting about the nature and essence of possibilities be something we could incorporate
into these representations. The future’s openness is outside of physics and is bound to
remain external to it. That leaves us with two options. If, in principle, physics encompasses
every aspect and facet of reality, then there is no such thing as an open future. Otherwise,
physics does not cover every aspect and facet of reality. I think that, to many, this is selfevident. So much of what we care about—love, humor, music, normativity—is not part
of the language of physics, perhaps not part of science at all. This is certainly a source of
concern and unease if you’re a reductive physicalist, but only then.
Let us introduce a distinction between what can be dubbed flat and consequential
indeterminism. Flat indeterminism is tenseless and does not assume an open future. It
consists simply in the existence, at any given time t, of propositions to which LEM does not
apply. Consequential indeterminism is tensed and is tied to the future’s openness. Insofar
as freedom, responsibility, creativity are concerned, only consequential freedom matters.
Thinkers such as Gisin are not after tenseless indeterminacy. Tenseless indeterminacy
is just as much a disappointment as tenseless motion, which is useful for mathematical
representations of motion but is a far cry from experienced motion. Tenseless indeterminacy
lacks what makes real indeterminacy important—an open future. Tenseless motion and
tenseless indeterminacy are alike frozen, fixed, and hollow.
We care about indeterminism because of future events that are important to us—the
game’s final score, the results of the next election, the future of our planet. Our hope that
things will evolve favorably is rooted in knowing that that is a genuine possibility, albeit
one among many. Tenseless indeterminism, in contrast, makes us yawn.
Gisin’s arguments regarding determinism are not merely about the kind of mathematics suitable for physics. In fact, they are not about that at all. It is not as though he is
advocating to replace classical with intuitionistic mathematics in the actual notebooks in
which physicists perform their calculations and develop their ideas. His true interest is in
reinstituting, let us call it, Humanism, in the Jamesean sense, (or Bergsonean, or Husserlian
or Wittgensteinean sense), into our conception of the world, and to do so against a powerful
current that has been dominating large portions of the philosophical landscape for more
than a century, a central principle of which is that our conception of the world should
be shaped first and foremost, not to say exclusively, by science. Determinism has been
regarded as a fundamental element of this conception. Gisin’s motivation is to show that
physics has been wrongly portrayed, often by some of its leading practitioners, as lending
unshakeable credence to determinism. Moreover, his pushback against determinism is
fueled by his conviction that we humans are free. Physics, he shows, does not impose
on us a view according to which the world is inhospitable to free will and free action. It
does not drive a wedge between how we experience ourselves as actors in the world, and
what we are supposed to believe about it. In other words, Gisin’s argument is not about
technicalities and not about theory. It is about the nature of the human being and her place
in the world. It is about rehabilitating respectability, after a century of positivistic scientism,
to a conception of reality that sees the world as a place in which we are striving to lead a
good life and, hopefully, a life of goodness. The openness of the future is central to this
care, and that is the meaning of indeterminism.
However, Gisin wants more than just to show that physics is not inherently deterministic. He would like physics to do much more, to explain “how time passes” ([4], p. 13366)
and to register the present’s “thickness” ([4], p. 13365), as if passage is a physical phenomenon like a rainbow and presentness some kind of stuff the thickness of which can be
measured. Elsewhere in his paper, Gisin expresses his grievances with Dolev’s contention
that “tense and passage are not, never were, and probably cannot be part of physics and

Entropy 2024, 26, 594

9 of 11

its language”. Gisin asks, “Shouldn’t one reply to Dolev by adapting the mathematical
language used by physics to make it compatible with indeterminism?” ([4], 13346-7). As
discussed above, physics has always been compatible with experienced temporality. Compatibility, however, is significantly more modest than Gisin’s more ambitious aim of a
physics of tense and passage—in his words, a physics that can “tell stories of how nature
does it in a language that allows humans to gain intuitive understanding” ([4], p. 13346-7,
italics in original). That is a fantasy—physics cannot tell stories about what is irremediably
foreign to its vocabulary.
In a thought-provoking 2024 paper [9] co-authored with Flavio Del Santo devoted to
an analysis of the manners in which time figures in logic, mathematics, and physics, Gisin
reiterates his conviction that physics can and should “allow one to tell stories about ‘how
nature does it’”. One could, perhaps, claim that whether tense and passage are part of
the story of physics depends on what one takes the scope of physics to be. If it includes
physicists’ sense that time passes, their verbal confirmation that time passes, if it includes
what physicists think the world their theories are about is like, then yes, tense and passage
are part of the story of physics. However, then, of course, they were already part of the
story told by Newtonian physics. If, on the other hand, physics is what it is standardly
taken to be—what we find in books, scientific papers, in the mathematical equations of the
laws of nature, in the results of experiments, or in the theories of physics themselves—there
is no trace of passage there.
Gisin claims that the approach advocated by Del Santo and himself “leads to a naturalistic characterization of the difference between past, present and future”. However, it is not
clear from their papers what this is supposed to mean. If it means that in physics one can
find a characterization of passage and tense in the same way that the laws of nature can be
found there, the above discussion shows that is not the case. If the idea is that physics will,
in some other way, tell us something about, enrich our understanding of, passage or the
distinction between the past, present, and future, no such enrichment is forthcoming. To
see how a fruitful investigation of tense and passage can be performed and what results
it can yield, one needs to look at the works of phenomenologists such as Husserl and
Merleau-Ponty. Studying attempts such as theirs to understand the essence of presentness,
futurity, and pastness, one is immediately struck by how far removed these investigations
and their insightful outcomes are from anything that can be gleaned from physics.
However, it is not just phenomenology. In the world of analytic philosophy, Dummett’s
work on intuitionistic logic and his rejection of bivalence as a fundamental principle of logic
have been immensely influential. No one has advocated the replacement of classical logic
with intuitionistic logic and the rejection of the law of excluded middle and bivalence more
vehemently than him. However, nowhere did he claim that merely removing bivalence
from logic makes for a formalism that “tells the story” of tense and passage. Principles
such as modus ponens and A∧B→B, are part of intuitionistic logic, passage is not. It is
we, who live in time and experience its nature, that assert that for our logic to cohere with
reality our understanding of logic must allow that there are propositions to which bivalence
does not apply. We can say that there is an open future, we can say, as Aristotle did, that
bivalence does not apply to future contingents. However, at any given moment, which
propositions are to be put in the future tense, which propositions bivalence applies to
and which not, above all, what it means to be future, or for the future to be open—these
are matters about which logic, classical or intuitionistic, has absolutely nothing to say. To
repeat, for that, we need to turn to phenomenological investigations, or to Bergson’s, let us
call it, experiential philosophy. However, again, Bergson, from whom Gisin borrows the
term “creative time”, never tired of stressing that the temporality he was studying, lived
temporality, contrasted sharply with time as it is found in physics. One recurring theme of
these phenomenological/experiential excursions is that temporality cannot be divorced
from normativity. Therefore, unless normativity becomes part of the story physics tells,
rich temporality, tense, and passage are not part of the story either.

In sum, unless you are a reductive physicalist, such a fantasy should not appeal to
you. Giving up on analyzing tense and passage scientifically does not mean relinquishing
the aspiration to attain acute insights into their nature. Time can be richly and profoundly
explored through a study of its role in our lives, a project phenomenologists have been
engaged in for decades.
6. Conclusions
It takes someone in the unique position of Gisin, a theoretician and a world-leading
experimentalist, to have the kind of insight into the application of mathematics in physics
that leads to the understanding that determinism is not integral to the theories of physics but
rather belongs to certain interpretations of these theories, interpretations which are shaped
by the fact that physics is conducted with what Gisin calls infinite information numbers,
namely, the real numbers of standard calculus. These numbers can, supposedly, represent
location with infinite accuracy, and therein lies the supposed potential for predictions that
are infinitely accurate. Gisin’s penetrating insight is that this is a myth—in practice, no
theory, no computer, no brain processes infinite information. This means that no matter how
accurately we describe the state of a system, that state is compatible with an array of states
the system may be in at other times. However, the further step Gisin takes, of claiming that a
different mathematical framework will do the impossible and give mathematical expression
to tense and passage, will facilitate absorbing indeterminism into physics, is futureless.
In passing I note (though this requires a more extensive discussion) that the same can
be said of machines that are the product of, among other things, physics. They cannot
be regarded as representing, let alone experiencing, tense and passage. If this remark
is correct, it raises a serious question regarding the validity of attributing sentience to
machines. For us, tense and passage, and consequential indeterminism, are essential
elements of experience. If these facets of experience cannot be recognized in machines,
which, so it seems, must be the case given that they cannot be recognized in the physics and
mathematics machines are based on, then machines cannot be thought of as experiencing
in any way that resembles human experience.
The quest to conceptualize indeterminism, not as an attitude to the world and life
which is compatible with physics, but as integral to physics itself, as the flesh and bones
of its mathematics, is, I believe, the product of a humanistic temperament trapped in a
scientistic environment. However, rather than pursuing it, it is possible to simply acknowledge the irreducibility to theory of the experience from which our understanding of time
derives. That, to borrow from James ([10], p. 146), can be performed as an exercise of
one’s untheorizable freedom (“. . .our first act of freedom, if we are free, ought in all inward
propriety to be to affirm that we are free” ([10], p. 146).).

From the origins to the stream
of consciousness and its neural
correlates
Sergey B. Yurchenko*

There are now dozens of very different theories of consciousness, each
somehow contributing to our understanding of its nature. The science of
consciousness needs therefore not new theories but a general framework
integrating insights from those, yet not making it a still-born “Frankenstein”
theory. First, the framework must operate explicitly on the stream of
consciousness, not on its static description. Second, this dynamical account
must also be put on the evolutionary timeline to explain the origins
of consciousness. The Cognitive Evolution Theory (CET), outlined here,
proposes such a framework. This starts with the assumption that brains
have primarily evolved as volitional subsystems of organisms, inherited from
primitive (fast and random) reflexes of simplest neural networks, only then
resembling error-minimizing prediction machines. CET adopts the tools of
critical dynamics to account for metastability, scale-free avalanches, and
self-organization which are all intrinsic to brain dynamics. This formalizes
the stream of consciousness as a discrete (transitive, irreflexive) chain of
momentary states derived from critical brain dynamics at points of phase
transitions and mapped then onto a state space as neural correlates of
a particular conscious state. The continuous/discrete dichotomy appears
naturally between the brain dynamics at the causal level and conscious states
at the phenomenal level, each volitionally triggered from arousal centers of
the brainstem and cognitively modulated by thalamocortical systems. Their
objective observables can be entropy-based complexity measures, reflecting
the transient level or quantity of consciousness at that moment.

Introduction
What can be said with certainty about the brain is that this is a complex dynamical
system: (i) governed by the deterministic laws of nature at the physical (causal)
or “hard” level which (ii) implements cognitive processing at the computational
(unconscious) or “soft” level while (iii) its conscious manifestations occur at the
phenomenal (mental) or “psyche” level. These three levels are also separated across
different spatial-temporal scales. Neural activity is presented at the microscale of cellular
interactions, cognitive processing occurs at the mesoscale of neural populations, and

conscious experience emerges only at the macroscale of
brain dynamics (Varela, 1995; Revonsuo and Newman, 1999).
Another way to distinguish between the hard and the soft
level in terms of network neuroscience is to relate the
former to structural (anatomical) connectivity of hard-wired
neurons, where causation really occurs. In contrast, the soft
level corresponds to functional connectivity, where distant
correlations between brain regions take place. Computations
at the soft level cannot violate causal interactions at the
hard level but are merely imposed upon physically interacting
neurons. They cannot change brain dynamics that obey
deterministic laws.
Thus, the mind-brain duality can be viewed in the
formal terms of “hard/soft” parallelism between causation and
computation. While computation is typically defined through
symbolic manipulations of information, its processing depends
ultimately on causal chains between inputs and outputs. The
question of how those symbolic manipulations translate into
conscious experience in the brain and why other informationprocessing systems such as computers and AI systems lack
conscious experience at the psyche level is one of the most
mysterious problems in neuroscience.
The main postulate of Gestalt psychology is that conscious
experience is a unified whole, which is greater than the sum
of its parts. More generally, this postulate is known in the
context of the spontaneous emergence of unexpected higherlevel phenomena that are not reducible to their low-level
constituents (Bedau and Humphreys, 2008; Gibb et al., 2019). A
related issue in neuroscience is specified as the binding problem:
how brain regions composed of billions of (unconscious)
neurons can generate a unified conscious experience at a given
moment of time (Edelman, 2003). In fact, many (if not all)
theories of consciousness originate from or, at least, can be
reduced to how they decide this problem. Among the candidates
proposed by known theories are integrated information (II) of
irreducible causal mechanisms (Tononi, 2008), global workspace
(GW) for broadcasting (Baars et al., 2013; Mashour et al.,
2020), updating of priors (UP) in predictive processing (Knill
and Pouget, 2004; Clark, 2013), meta-representation (MR)
by recurrent processing (Lamme, 2006; Rosenthal, 2008),
self-organized criticality (SOC) in brain dynamics (Werner,
2009; Kozma and Freeman, 2017), adaptive resonance (AR) of
brain structures (Grossberg, 2017; Hunt and Schooler, 2019),
and even large-scale quantum entanglement with a consequent
collapse (Hameroff and Penrose, 2014; Fisher, 2015).
Those in turn can be grouped by the similarity of
mechanisms or processes involved: II + GW by integrationdifferentiation processes, GW + UP + MR by feedback
mechanisms, SOC + AR by spontaneous synchronization and
phase transition. However, any grouping is somewhat arbitrary
as the underlying mechanisms can converge to a thermodynamic
account: the neural binding arises when brain activity is
balanced on the edge between order and disorder. Broadly

speaking, consciousness emerges in a very special state of matter
somewhere between a perfect crystal and an ideal gas (Tegmark,
2015).
The cognitive evolution theory or CET (Yurchenko, 2022),
outlined here, adopts the SOC approach for its apparent
advantages over the above models in studying consciousness.
SOC is neurophysiologically reliable in resolving the binding
problem without resorting to exotic physics or mysterious
mind-matter dualism. This provides rich mathematical
formalisms applicable to brain dynamics. SOC also proposes
the avenue for explaining universal dynamical capacities of the
brain to account for large-scale emergent phenomena without
involving the so-called downward or top-down causation that
might make consciousness like a homunculus due to “synergistic
emergence” (Lau, 2009; Hoel et al., 2013; Mediano et al., 2022).
On the other hand, SOC is abundantly presented in nature (Bak,
1996; Jensen, 1998; Haken, 2004). However, we do not normally
assume that an arbitrary physical system exhibiting critical
signatures is conscious. Something else must be inherent to a
system to generate consciousness.
CET starts from the obvious fact that the only place where
consciousness certainly resides is the brain. There are four
principled features that make the brain distinct from all other
critical systems. First, the brain consists of neurons specialized
for transmitting information over spike patterns. The neurons
had evolved from autonomous biological cells possessing all
properties of life not merely as mechanistic binary devices.
Hence, consciousness is a property of living systems. Second,
there are arousal mechanisms regulating sleep-wake cycles in
these living systems which can be suppressed by anesthetics. It
is also known that damage to arousal nuclei causes immediate
coma when the rest of the brain can remain intact (Parvizi and
Damasio, 2001; Giacino et al., 2014). Hence, consciousness is
impossible without involving special neural nuclei in the brain
responsible for arousal. Third, the brain learns and accumulates
knowledge. Hence, the brain is a cognitively evolving system.
However, AI systems can learn and even cognitively evolve
without any kind of awareness. Is there something else that
is inherent to the conscious brain but absent in unconscious
machines?
The fourth and ultimate distinction is volition, the ability to
make free decisions not causally predetermined from the past.
This valuable property is thought to be intrinsic to many (if
not all) brain systems regardless of their conscious features. In
contrast, we do not normally grant volition to computers and AI
systems even if they can sometimes surpass humans in cognitive
performance. The volition of this kind is akin to one that can
be ascribed to clockwork’s engine, i.e., it is an ordinary physical
process carrying energy out of one place into another. How
much our intuition is right by assuming that consciousness and
volition are evolutionarily linked?
With the advent of causation neuroscience, the detailed
relationship between statistical models of neural activity and

that, by itself, does not violate determinism. Brain dynamics can
still be completely deterministic, i.e., predetermined.
Many free-will advocates usually suggest that if even
conscious volition cannot violate determinism at the causal
level, it can still be involved in long-term planning of
actions at the psyche level. They argue that the ability to
use optimal algorithms in predictive processing would be a
much more important factor than whether the brain operates
deterministically or not (Rolls, 2020). Does it mean that by
using those algorithms AI systems might suddenly acquire free
volition? Relevantly, relying on this pure computational aspect
of volition in the context of the hard-soft duality would imply
no obstacle in creating machine (hence, copyable) consciousness
at the psyche level (Dehaene et al., 2017; VanRullen and
Kanai, 2021). This comes from the observation that there can
be no operational difference between a perfect computational
simulation of, for instance, Alice’s actions and an in silico copy
of her consciousness running automatically on many digital
clones (Aaronson, 2016). Thus, ignoring the hard-soft duality
also entails the problem of the privacy of consciousness: the
clones should know what it is like to be Alice.
A typical scenario suggested for manifesting free volition
at the computational (soft) level is one where Alice can
consciously plan something ahead of time, for example, visiting
her friends tonight. Thus, Alice’s freedom to choose can be
proven by achieving her goal. Upon a closer examination, all
such scenarios are behavior-driven, yet based on uncertain and
rough assumptions about what occurs at the microscale of neural
interactions. Within a rigorous physical framework, the spatial
and temporal locations of action should be specified via the
stream of conscious states, each processed by the brain at the
hard level.
Suppose Alice plans to visit her friends at the moment t 0
when her consciousness is in a state X. Whenever she could
reach this goal, her conscious state at that exact moment t would
be Y. But the state Y should in turn have been consistently
processed from the previous state Y − 1 over ubiquitous causal
chains. How could it be done freely? Moreover, the manifestation
of the conscious will should be related not to Alice being at
her goal state Y but to its mental initiation in X. Indeed, after
the decision has been made, her goal-directed behavior could
be completely deterministic. However, this state should also
be causally processed from the previous state X − 1, and so
on. How could mental initiation be free of the past? Hence, if
consciousness cannot choose the next state from a given past
state, no future state in the stream can be chosen at all.
On the other hand, if the brain cannot make a
choice free of the past, the old-fashioned fatalism, also
known as superdeterminism in the context of quantum
mechanics (‘t Hooft, 2016; Hossenfelder and Palmer,
2020), would prevail. This states that neither consciousness
nor even the brain might violate deterministic laws to do
otherwise than what has been predetermined by the past. How

actual causation in the brain is intensively debated (e.g.,
Albantakis et al., 2019; Reid et al., 2019; Weichwald and Peters,
2021). Statistical measures such as Granger Causality (Granger,
1969) or Entropy Transfer (Schreiber, 2000) had been suggested
to infer some aspect of causal interaction among neural entities
that are then modeled on a particular structural time-directed
graph over a set of nodes. Their definition is based entirely on the
predictability of some time-series. If Y contains information that
helps to predict X beyond the degree to which X already predicts
its own future, then Y is said to have a causal influence on X.
Causal modeling must reflect dynamic processes irrelevant to the
question of whether a system of interest processes information
or not. In cognitive neuroscience, causal inference is based on
a synthesis of functional and effective connectivity extracted
from neuroimaging data (Friston, 1994). The “gold standard”
to establishing whether a stimulus variable Y affects the target
variable X is to introduce controlled perturbations to the brain.
It must be however emphasized that causality measures
do not necessarily reflect physical causal chains (Seth,
2008). Meanwhile, brain dynamics are commonly believed
to evolve completely in causal ways over conscious and
unconscious volitional repertoires of the brain. Within those
volitional repertoires, the ability generally labeled “free
will” is associated with the sum of executive functions, selfcontrol, decision-making, and long-term planning. Thus, it
makes free will inseparable from the biological function of
consciousness, evolution-driven, and implicitly active (Feinberg
and Mallatt, 2020). Putting the above question differently, could
consciousness supervene on its own physical substrate to choose
the course of action free of predetermination from the past?
To answer this question, a unified theory of consciousness
should account for brain activity at three hierarchical levels: (i) at
the causal (hard) level; (ii) at the computational (soft) level; and
(iii) at the phenomenal (psyche) level. The first two levels should
explain how subjective experience and self-awareness emerge
from the underlying brain dynamics over which cognitive
processing is carried out.

Consciousness and volition in brain
dynamics
The stochastic account of free volition can be often found
in the literature. For example, Rolls (2012) suggests: “in so
far as the brain operates with some degree of randomness
due to the statistical fluctuations produced by the random
spiking times of neurons, brain function is to some extent
non-deterministic, as defined in terms of these statistical
fluctuations.” Since the brain contains billions of neurons, causal
processes can be only estimated with the help of network
statistics extracted from different neuroimaging data. However,
probabilistic (counterfactual) descriptions, as those derived from
causality measures, reflect the state of our knowledge (ignorance)

could free volition be reconciled with computational models of
consciousness at the hard level?

just superdeterministic (see below). It could well account for the
individuality of subjective experience as specified by the complex
at the psyche level but not for the indeterminism of volition
at the hard level. The IIT approach can be even extended to a
general idea that the very evolution of life is just the triumph of
determinism. It argues that living systems can thrive across the
universe as soon as these autonomous systems have more causeeffect power than non-living environments (Marshall et al.,
2017).
On the contrary, Predictive Processing Theory (PPT) can
well explain perception, cognition, and action by making the
brain an error-minimizing machine (Clark, 2013; Seth and
Hohwy, 2021). Although PPT is unclear about where exactly,
between priors and posteriors, the conscious experience should
appear, it can in principle separate discrete conscious states
emerging at the psyche level as ultimate decisions of Bayesian
learning from unconscious predictive processing at the soft
level. Nevertheless, PPT cannot still account for free volition,
which is covertly embedded in attentional effort and active
inference (Friston et al., 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2018). This is just
the point where free will and active consciousness converge. If
consciousness is an algorithm for the maximization of resilience
(Rudrauf et al., 2017), then PPT has to explain how and why
conscious processing in the brain should differ from deep
machine learning in AI systems, which can exploit the same
computational models but lack both volition and conscious
experience.
Another dominant theory, Global Workspace Theory
(GWT), relies explicitly on the active role of consciousness
at the psyche level, which is required for global access,
broadcasting information, and self-monitoring (Dehaene and
Changeux, 2011; Baars et al., 2013). According to the theory,
a physical system “whose successive states unfold according to
a deterministic rule can still be described as having free will,
if it is able to represent a goal and to estimate the outcomes
of its actions before initiating them” (Dehaene and Naccache,
2001). Thus, GWT adopts just the aforementioned scenario with
Alice deciding where she will be tonight. It is therefore not
surprising that GWT does not suggest any obstacle to machine
consciousness (Dehaene et al., 2017), which by virtue of its
cognitive architecture could be spontaneously endowed with
free will.
Finally, psychological theories such as Higher-Order
Thought (Lau and Rosenthal, 2011), Attention Schema
(Graziano et al., 2020), Radical Plasticity Thesis (Cleeremans,
2011), or Self Comes to Mind (Damasio, 2010) argue that
self-awareness or metacognition would separate conscious states
from unconscious processing via self-referential mechanisms.
These mechanisms would make the brain aware of its own states,
unlike other biological and artificial networks. Accordingly,
conscious will in these theories is similar to “conscious veto”
suggested by Libet (1985) to circumvent the findings of his
famous free will experiments.

Volition in theories of consciousness
Consciousness and volition are intrinsically linked, and
both are largely ignored in neuroscience. Although there are
now a plethora of various theories of consciousness, the free
will problem still remains largely neglected. The theories do
not explain how the brain integrates consciousness (psyche),
cognition (soft), and volition (hard) seamlessly across the three
hierarchical levels. Yet, as being static in nature, most of them
aim to explain the structure of conscious experience per se
without accounting for the successive alternation of conscious
states over time. Many authors attempt to compare these theories
(Doerig et al., 2021; Del Pin et al., 2021; Signorelli et al.,
2021), or even to reconcile some of them (Shea and Frith,
2019; Chang et al., 2020; Graziano et al., 2020; Mashour et al.,
2020; Northoff and Lamme, 2020; Mallatt, 2021; Seth and
Hohwy, 2021; VanRullen and Kanai, 2021; Niikawa et al., 2022).
Another tendency is to incorporate these static theories into
a more general dynamical framework such as the Temporospatial Theory of Consciousness (Northoff and Zilio, 2022)
which is somewhat reminiscent of Operational Architectonics
(Fingelkurts et al., 2010), the whole-brain mechanistic models
from a bottom-up perspective (Cofré et al., 2020), or the
self-organizing harmonic modes coupled with the free energy
principle (Safron, 2020).
In general, all these theories are not concerned with
brain dynamics at the underlying hard level from which
conscious states emerge. As being static in design, they have
also missed another fundamental aspect of consciousness,
namely, its cognitive evolution over a lifetime going by
accumulating new knowledge and skills. Accordingly, the stream
of consciousness (though implied) is not properly defined.
At the same time, they all ascribe a special, active role to
consciousness while being indifferent to the free will problem
by adopting the view that consciousness can somehow influence
brain dynamics at the psyche level. It is implicitly assumed
that consciousness: (i) facilitates learning; (ii) is useful for
voluntary decision-making; and (iii) provides stability to the
objects of experience in an egocentric framework (Seth and
Baars, 2005).
For example, Integrated Information Theory (IIT) defines
consciousness as information a system is able to integrate. It does
not consider perception, cognition, and action at all by aiming
at the quantitative account of phenomenal consciousness due to
“irreducible causal mechanisms” (Oizumi et al., 2014). It makes
the striking conclusion that “a conscious choice is freer, the
more it is causally constrained within a maximally irreducible
complex” (Tononi, 2013) without explaining how free volition
might be manifested there. Such a kind of volition turns out to be

ruling out conscious will from Libet-type experiments, only
the indeterminism of neural activity can account for the Bell
theorem, which has been well-confirmed experimentally (e.g.,
Aspect et al., 1982).
Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) of Hameroff
and Penrose (2014), the most known of quantum-inspired
theories of consciousness, is explicitly based on the
indeterminism of the wavefunction collapse or “objective
reduction” (OR), also known as the measurement problem.
In quantum mechanics, the measurement problem has the
striking property of observer-dependence. In contrast, Penrose
argues for a real quantum-gravitational OR that occurs
everywhere in the universe, independently of observation, as
spontaneous “proto-conscious” events that are then orchestrated
in microtubules of the brain to give rise to consciousness
and volition. According to Orch OR, consciousness must
be in principle incomputable as being orchestrated (Orch)
by quantum entanglement with consequent OR. Nonlocal
correlations between microtubules (for global binding of
dissociated brain regions) and backward time referral (for closed
causal loops) are then required “to rescue causal agency and
conscious free will” (Hameroff, 2012).
Remarkably, the mathematicians Conway and Kochen in
their Free Will Theorem (a modified version of the Bell theorem)
make a statement very similar to that of Penrose (though without
concerning themselves with OR): “If conscious observers have
a certain freedom to choose, then particles already have their
own share of this freedom” (Conway and Kochen, 2008). It
is often argued that the quantum randomness on which the
statement reposes has little to do with “free will” thought to
be caused by a reason rather than by chance (Koch, 2009;
Aaronson, 2016). Conway and Kochen had however noted
that if a subject’s action was indeed free of the past, then it
should be difficult to find a testable (i.e., objective from a thirdperson perspective) difference between physical randomness
and the subject’s genuine behavioral freedom, both not being
predetermined by the previous history of the universe. In the
context of neuroscience, their statement has to be inverted and
specified as follows:

The Libet-type experiments have been based on two
temporal measures: the readiness potential detected from the
supplementary motor area, and the awareness of wanting to
move reported with the clock. The delay observed between
neural motor predictors at the hard level and conscious
intentions at the psyche level was around several hundred
milliseconds (Libet, 1985; Guggisberg and Mottaz, 2013;
Schultze-Kraft et al., 2016), thereby making conscious intentions
a post-factum phenomenon. Libet had proposed that it could
occur due to conscious deliberations before consciousness could
block an action with the explicit veto on the movement.
Nevertheless, since any kind of intentional veto must also be
causally processed, it has been noted that the blocking itself
could be predetermined (Soon et al., 2013).
Yet, some authors assume that noisy neural fluctuations can
be involved in self-initiated actions (Schurger et al., 2012). They
argue that the key precursor process for triggering internallygenerated actions could be essentially random in a stochastic
framework (Khalighinejad et al., 2018). First, those actions
generated internally by the brain from noisy fluctuations would
have little relevance to the ability of consciousness to make its
own choice. Meanwhile, in the psychological theories mentioned
above, conscious will would involve higher-order thoughts to
check many moves ahead of time, and then with this information
to make a free choice (Rolls, 2020). Second, stochastic noise as
being classical (thermal) in nature does not violate determinism
to account for freely generated actions even on the brain’s
authorship. Something else is needed.
In contrast, quantum-inspired theories of consciousness
take seriously the free will problem by adopting quantum
indeterminism that might affect brain dynamics at the hard level.
They are based on the conceptualization of free will suggested by
Bell in his famous theorem (Bell, 1993). The key assumption of
Bell was that Alice’s free choice (as defined above) should not be
controlled by any hidden (unknown to our modern knowledge)
deterministic variables λ. For example, these variables might
include all the internal and external information about the past
of Alice’s brain and everything in her environment. The choice is
then formalized by conditional probability,
p(A λ) = p(A)

(1)

If particles have some freedom to respond to the environment
independently of the past, then the observers have the
same kind of initial freedom due to a quantum mechanism
Bell-certified by Equation (1) in their brains.

The theorem had shown that under measurements of preciously
prepared quantum experiments no such variables should exist
in principle unless we had to agree on a “cosmic conspiracy”
that constrained Alice to make not any choice but just the
one that did not violate standard statistical correlations of the
Bell’s inequality (Gallicchio et al., 2014). Note that, as suggested
beyond the neuroscientific context of Libet-type experiments,
Equation (1) does not discriminate between a choice made by
Alice with her conscious will, and a choice internally generated
by her brain itself. The only thing required there is that A
has not been predetermined from the past by λ. Thus, by

Of course, ascribing free will to living or non-living systems
does not depend anyhow on quantum effects. Volition is
typically associated with the action a system is capable of
initiating. It necessarily involves causation. However, what is
the sense of saying that a clockwork toy has the volition to
move, or, that a more sophisticated AI system is self-initiated in
performing a cognitive task? To discriminate between volition

chauvinistic or even perverse (Lamme, 2018; Fields et al., 2021).
Nonetheless, the tradition to separate humans from the rest of
the animal kingdom is still persistent. Now the division has
shifted to the free will debate. It is assumed that only humans
enjoy free will due to the sophisticated computations the human
brain is able to carry out at the soft level, while other animals,
though passively conscious, are deprived of this gift (Doyle,
2009). CET finds this division evolutionarily implausible.
Maintaining homeostasis in the face of dangerous and
unfortunate environmental conditions is the basic imperative
for the evolution of the brain (Ashby, 1960). The only valuable
advantage the living systems might gain over non-living systems
is the ability to decide their way freely among stimulus-reaction
repertoires. This ability is commonly referred to as volition.
Meanwhile, volitional mechanisms of the brain are still ignored
in cognitive neuroscience, remaining hidden under attentional
effort, enactive cognitive function, and conscious control. CET
argues that volition is a key neural mechanism of evolution
placed between organisms and non-living systems. Life could
not have flourished on Earth without volitional mechanisms
which are the only neural candidate that opens a door to the
stimulus-reaction repertoires over the “tyranny” of causal chains.
The underlying idea here is the one of evolutionary
neurobiology: the ultimate aim of brain evolution over species,
from simplest organisms to humans, was to maximize their
adaptive success. Under selection pressure, the main function
of neural systems resulted in their ability to integrate and
process a very large number of sensory inputs and motor
responses occurring in parallel (Edelman, 2003). Thus, the
cognitive evolution of the brain over every organism’s lifetime
(ontogeny) and the general evolution of the brain over species
(phylogeny) should go hand in hand to promote each other.
CET makes the general assumption that after acquiring free
volition mechanisms to overcome the fatalism of causeeffect interactions which govern completely non-living systems,
organisms could have advanced their adaptive success only by
evolving cognitive functions capable of predicting future events.
Cognition and memory should have evolved exclusively as
adaptive (computational) abilities of organisms at the soft level
to benefit from some underlying volitional mechanism at the
hard level. Otherwise, evolution would have had no reason to
advance those adaptive properties over rigid causal chains in
deterministic systems.
How much is it plausible that evolution had endowed
primitive networks of simplest organisms with some kind of
freedom which would have been of value for them in survival
and reproduction? Can invertebrates have some volitional
mechanism, evolutionarily embedded in their neural networks
to make a choice not predetermined by the past? CET
argues that primitive neural networks should have primarily
evolved as free-volitional subsystems of organisms, not as
deterministic prediction machines (Knill and Pouget, 2004;
Clark, 2013), requiring larger biological resources. Accordingly,

and trivial energy flow in an arbitrary (natural or artificial)
system the former must not be predetermined from the past.
Volition is not a matter of consciousness or cognition but
a matter of causal freedom. Under this definition, quantum
particles can have some sort of freedom but this freedom is
washed out in macroscopic systems.
To bind volition with consciousness, we need to translate
physical predetermination into the notion of predictability.
First of all, deterministic systems can in principle be perfectly
predictable. It is already a matter of our current knowledge
and technology. Now let us modify the famous Turing test
where a machine might mimic a human by answering various
questions. Suppose, a future machine can be trained to predict
precisely Alice’s every choice ahead of time. The machine can
thus perfectly simulate Alice’s stream of consciousness so that we
might be fooled by asking any question. Why then should we
deny that the machine possesses a copy of Alice’s consciousness
and, thus, is itself conscious?
Hence, if we disagree that humans are very sophisticated
but still deterministic and copyable machines, there must be
something that prevents one from making a deterministic
machine conscious. This is volition. Indeed, if Alice’s brain
is able to make a choice not predetermined from the past,
there cannot be in principle a perfect predictor of Alice’s
stream of consciousness. This makes her consciousness unique,
i.e., non-copyable for any future technology. Thus, the reason
to assume the above statement stems fundamentally from the
evolutionary perspective.
CET suggests a dynamical model based on a framework,
drawn over diverse neuroscientific domains, with contributions
from critical dynamics, predictive processing, and evolutionary
neurobiology to approach a unified theory of consciousness
grounded in physics. The widespread idea that brains are
error-minimizing machines has neglected a crucial ingredient
of its adaptive framework: before minimizing an error the
brain should already have that error internally triggered under
cognitive correction. CET argues that the brain can be viewed
more generally as both an error-amplifier and a modulator
of the primitive volitional reflexes based on chemo- and
photoreceptors of unicellular organisms. In doing so, CET makes
the assumption that brains have primarily evolved as volitional
(quantum in origin) subsystems of organisms at the hard level.
CET emphasizes the importance of randomness in evolution
(Yurchenko, 2021a) contrary to the idea that life can be viewed
as the triumph of determinism (Marshall et al., 2017).

from subcortical arousal centers via the ascending reticular
activating system (ARAS) to thalamocortical systems, involved
in perception and cognition at the computational (soft) level.
In CET, conscious experience emerges at the psyche level as
a passive phenomenon of cognitive brain evolution that goes
by accumulating new knowledge and skills freshly updated in
memory networks.
By postulating the quantum mechanism that will be called
the “neurophysiological free-volition mechanism” (NFVM)
and placed into the brainstem, CET can account for the
indeterminism of brain dynamics without resorting to largescale quantum mysteries1 . The corollaries are the following.
While brain dynamics will still be presented by classical
stochastic processes as those traditionally described in standard
models of neuroscience, the stream of consciousness will no
longer be predetermined from the past by hidden deterministic
variables λ due to the presence of the NFVM. This makes
Alice’s consciousness (whose secured privacy is guaranteed by
the Bell-certified NFVM) unique but gives her consciousness no
power over the brain unlike typical scenarios mentioned above.
In general, the controversy around free will has been
inherited by the science of consciousness from the mind-body
problem, originally discussed in philosophy. What exactly
should be associated with Alice? Is it her brain or her
consciousness generated by her brain (leaving aside her body
that makes the brain alive and functional)? In CET, if Alice is
associated with her brain, she has free volition. On the contrary,
if Alice is associated with her consciousness, she has no free
will. Consider, for instance, the following sentence: “I can have
true free will: I can have true alternatives, true freedom to
choose among them, true will to cause what I have decided,
and eventually true responsibility” (Tononi et al., 2022). For
CET, the validity of this statement depends on how the “I” is
conceptualized.
This also implies that not integrated information of
irreducible causal mechanisms (Tononi, 2008; Oizumi et al.,
2014), architecture peculiarities of neural networks (Dehaene
and Naccache, 2001; Baars et al., 2013), cognitive processing
(Clark, 2013), or higher-order linguistic thoughts (Lau and
Rosenthal, 2011; Rolls, 2012) but free volition, inherited by
the brain from fast and random reflexes rooted in chemo-,

their conscious properties, typically related to higher animals,
should have appeared later than their unconscious cognitive
functions presented in invertebrates (Brembs, 2011). Instead of
being an active participant that creates an internal representation
of the environment, the conscious experience would be
an extension of primitive volitional-emotional motivations
(Mashour and Alkire, 2013). Thus, contrary to the idea that
evolution had evolved consciousness to perform complex
volitional actions (Pennartz et al., 2019; Feinberg and Mallatt,
2020), in CET consciousness is a byproduct of both volitional
mechanisms and unconscious cognitive processing grounded in
sensorimotor coupling (Engel et al., 2013). With this assumption
on the origins of consciousness, CET suggests a radically new
and physically rigorous solution to the free will problem.
Unlike the known quantum-inspired models involving the
most mysterious quantum-mechanical effects to account for
quantum computing and/or quantum memory storage that
might directly mediate consciousness (Hameroff and Penrose,
2014; Fisher, 2015; Georgiev, 2020), CET suggests a minimal
use of quantum randomness at the sub-cellular level. This
refers to the most reliable mechanisms like the Beck-Eccles
quantum trigger, proposed as a quantum-mechanical model for
the mechanism of exocytosis (Beck and Eccles, 1992, 1998).
Exocytosis is a discrete all-or-nothing event consisting of the
opening of presynaptic membrane channels with the release of
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The trigger is based on
the tunneling of a quasi-particle across a potential energy barrier.
Beck and Eccles (1992) argue that “the mental intention (the
volition) becomes neurally effective by momentarily increasing
the probability of exocytosis in selected cortical areas such as
the supplementary motor area.” Thus, they maintain the cortexcentered conceptualization of conscious free will in Libet-type
experiments.
Instead, CET places the mechanism in the brainstem to
account for the indeterminism of unconscious free volition
initiated in the arousal nuclei. This key quantized event
could then be physically amplified across many spatiotemporal
scales due to neuronal avalanches which are intrinsic to SOC
(Blanchard et al., 2000; Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Chialvo, 2010;
Tognoli and Kelso, 2014). The brainstem is a phylogenetically
ancient brain region that comprises various nuclei executing
many vital autonomic functions for maintaining homeostasis
such as blood pressure, heartbeat, or blood sugar levels
(Paus, 2000; Parvizi and Damasio, 2001). Those autonomic
functions should have evolved much early than thalamocortical
regions engaged in elaborating cognitive contents and conscious
experience.
Remarkably, this ancient region also contains the arousal
centers responsible for permanent vigilance upon which the
stream of consciousness reposes. Its arousal machinery is a
precondition for behavior and conscious experience (Mashour
and Alkire, 2013). CET proposes that each conscious state
in the stream is volitionally driven at the causal (hard) level

Here, the mechanism is called “neurophysiological” to emphasize
that CET has nothing to do with any kind of mind-brain dualism or
psyche-matter complementarity, advocated by prominent scientists
such as von Neumann, Pauli, Wheeler, Eccles, and Popper. CET does
not also admit downward (top-down) causation, a covert version of
dualism that might endow consciousness with causal power over the
brain (Hoel et al., 2013; Mediano et al., 2022). Yet, the word “free”
implies that causal power of volition must necessarily be free of
predetermination. That is, CET does not adopt a compatibilist account
of free will.

2. Dynamism (temporality): consciousness not only requires
the NCC but also the time to be cognitively processed at
the soft level;

dynamics can account for the emergence of conscious
states at the psyche level.

magneto-, and photoreceptor cells which are very sensitive to
quantum effects (Arndt et al., 2009; Brookes, 2017; McFadden
and Al-Khalili, 2018) is the main obstacle that prevents computer
scientists from making deterministic machines conscious.

The stream of consciousness in
brain dynamics

A principled distinction between CET and classical theories
is that CET involves quantum indeterminism. On the other
hand, while quantum-inspired theories engage quantum
computing across the whole cortex to account for consciousness
and free volition, CET makes minimal use of quantum
randomness placed into the arousal nuclei of the brainstem to
initiate cognitive processing due to stochastic brain dynamics
that are classical in nature. Thus, CET is a semi-classical physical
theory of consciousness.

Consciousness has been a prescientific concept with a
number of different connotations that relate to various aspects of
conscious experience. The science of consciousness must rely on
the fact that consciousness is a dynamic process, not a thing or a
capacity (James, 1950). It should also take into account that the
observation of single cells activity has little to say about mental
processes. Large-scale interactions between neural networks are
therefore more important than the contribution of individual
neurons per se. Thus, only neural dynamics at the macro-scale
can account for global brain states accompanied by conscious
experience. Most attempts to understand the neural mechanisms
of consciousness have proceeded by searching for the “neural
correlates of consciousness” or NCC (Crick and Koch, 2003).
However, correlations by themselves do not provide explanations
and there is a need for a framework connecting fundamental
aspects of conscious experience at the phenomenal (psyche) level
to the corresponding aspects of brain dynamics at the underlying
causal (hard) level.
The evolution of consciousness depends on the physical
continuous dynamics of the brain, comprising about 1011
neurons connected to each other by thousands of synapses.
Clearly, consciousness not only requires neural correlates with
their appropriate anatomical architecture but also the time
to be processed. A wealth of experimental evidence suggests
that conscious experience is a discrete phenomenon processed
unconsciously at the soft level (see Section “Temporal resolution
of the stream of consciousness”). Moreover, a pure biophysical
approach to studying neural activity at micro- and mesoscopic
scales cannot account for subjective, internally generated mental
phenomena without resorting to their contextual emergence
at the macroscopic scale (Atmanspacher and beim Graben,
2007). It has been pointed out many times that there should be
an optimal spatio-temporal grain size at which the brain can
generate phenomenal experience (Tononi, 2008; Chang et al.,
2020). In general, the correspondence between conscious states
and neural processes should be provided by mapping brain
dynamics onto the state space of consciousness.
CET compresses all these requirements into three key
prerequisites:

Deriving consciousness from brain
dynamics
Based on the three prerequisites, CET will model
consciousness as the stream of macrostates, each specified
by a particular structural-functional configuration of the wholebrain network N, where NCC ⊆ N. Here N stands for a graph
G = (N, E), where N = |N| is the set of nodes (ideally, neurons),
and E ⊆ N × N is the set of edges (ideally, synapses). Because it is
computationally impossible to operate on N ≈ 1011 , the first step
in formalizing the stream of consciousness is to approximate
large-scale brain dynamics at the hard level. To derive the stream
from the SOC approach, CET refers to the Langevin formalism
as a most general description of a system that depends upon a
deterministic flow y and stochastic fluctuations ω [which, note,
do not discriminate between quantum (i.e., ontic) and statistical
(i.e., epistemic) randomness, e.g., in Brownian motion]
dψ = −γ ψ(t)dt + dω(t)

The formalism can then be transformed into different models
depending on the way researchers will adopt that formalism
in their study. Those models may be biophysical (meanfield) approximations (Breakspear, 2017; Parr et al., 2020) or
phenomenological (synchronization) models such as StuartLandau, Kuramoto, Haken-Kelso-Bunz, and other models
(Cofré et al., 2020; Kelso, 2021; Kraikivski, 2022; Vohryzek et al.,
2022).
Here ψ (N, t) is a descriptive function whose representation
by the order parameter in a phase space O should account
for metastability, avalanches, and SOC of the global neural
activity wandering among dynamical attractors (Kelso, 1995).
Originally grounded in physics, chemistry, and biology (Bak,
1996; Jensen, 1998; Haken, 2004), SOC is thought to be of
crucial importance in neural activity as it poises the brain on the

Similarly, Equation (3) represents consciousness as a
dynamical characteristic of the neural network N not as an
intrinsic potency of causal mechanisms in the brain or anywhere
else. According to this conceptualization, the brain has no
mental force if its dynamics depart from criticality, as it occurs
in unconscious states such as coma, sleep, or general anesthesia
(Hudetz et al., 2014; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016; Golkowski et al.,
2019; Huang et al., 2020), but not in resting states where neural
activity preserves criticality (Deco and Jirsa, 2012; Barttfeld et al.,
2015). On the other hand, even in critical dynamics, the brain
lacks the mental force during some interval ∆t until a next
conscious state is unconsciously processed.
To make the above analogy more comprehensive, imagine a
clockwork toy, say, a jumping frog. The engine of the toy will
impel it to iterate the same jump over and over. The force occurs
only at discrete moments of jump-initiation between which
motion decays. In critical dynamics, the brain exhibits flexible
patterns of coordinated dynamics which decay after some critical
value (Gollo et al., 2012; Tognoli and Kelso, 2014). Conscious
experience can be ignited only on the edge between the two
phases as if the brain accumulated information for triggering the
next “jump” with some mental force at discrete moments of time
(Figure 1A).

edge between order and disorder near a bifurcation (Blanchard
et al., 2000; Chialvo, 2010; Beggs and Timme, 2012; Deco
et al., 2015). This allows the neural network N to exhibit the
properties of scale-free networks and to produce flexible patterns
of coordination dynamics at the hard level. This, in turn, can
generate a repertoire of different conscious states at the psyche
level, thereby increasing an adaptive behavioral response of the
organism to given environmental stimuli (Hesse and Gross,
2014; Cocchi et al., 2017; Dahmen et al., 2019).
CET postulates the emergence of consciousness from brain
dynamics at critical points as its derivative extracted in

The continuous/discrete dichotomy appears naturally between
the brain dynamics, described at the causal (hard) level, and the
stream S(τ ) of conscious states, presented at the phenomenal
(psyche) level. In effect, Equation (3) should capture the
instantaneous transitions from continuous brain dynamics to
discretized conscious states, identified with a single point o ∈
O in a phase space. The phase transitions in brain dynamics
occurring at discrete moments of time can then be viewed as
the manifestation of pulsating consciousness in the framework
of cinematic theory of cognition (Freeman, 2006). This approach
finds now experimental evidence in many studies (Haimovici
et al., 2013; Mediano et al., 2016; Tagliazucchi, 2017; Demertzi
et al., 2019; Kim and Lee, 2019) showing that only states
integrated near criticality can ignite conscious experience in the
brain.
CET suggests a simple mathematical analogy between
consciousness and the physical force, derived from the
momentum in Newtonian mechanics,
F = dp/dt = ma

Temporal resolution of the stream of
consciousness
According to Equation (3), the brain needs some time to
process a new conscious state from the previous one. There are
two complementary ways to estimate the interval ∆t– either
by monitoring brain dynamics to calculate phase transitions
at the hard level or by obtaining a subjective report at the
psyche level. Unfortunately, both approaches do not provide an
exact estimate. The monitoring of brain dynamics is non-trivial
because of the heterogeneous intrinsic timescales involved. An
averaged interval is usually reported to be about 200 ms (Kozma
and Freeman, 2017; Deco et al., 2019). The second approach,
based on first-person reportability, is affected by the problem of
multiple temporal resolutions (White, 2018).
To comprise both approaches, we assign the interval to
a wide window 1t ≈ 100–450 ms that encompasses multiple
experimental findings—from the periodicity of attentional cycles
at approximately 7–13 Hz (VanRullen et al., 2014) to the
attentional blink on masked targets separated by 200–450 ms
(Shapiro et al., 1997; Drissi-Daoudi et al., 2019). Yet, an
important neurophysiological aspect of brain dynamics is that
the stream S(τ ) cannot be normally delayed for a period longer
than about 300 ms according to the timescale proposed to
be crucial for the emergence of consciousness (Dehaene and
Changeux, 2011). Consciousness spontaneously fades after that
period, for example, in anesthetized states (Hudetz et al., 2014;
Tagliazucchi et al., 2016).

(4)

Seeing consciousness as a “mental force” seems to be more
moderate and accurate, at least ontologically, than viewing
consciousness as a fundamental property of matter like mass,
charge, and energy (Tononi, 2008). The analogy between
conscious experience and mass, advocated by IIT, is based on
a quantitative account of the level of consciousness measured by
integrated information Φ a single complex of irreducible causal
mechanisms might generate (Oizumi et al., 2014). IIT argues:
if a complex can generate Φ, no matter whether it is organic
or not, it will have consciousness (Tononi and Koch, 2015).
Instead, CET brings into focus the dynamism of consciousness.
The analogy with force goes in line with the fact there is a tiny
but principled distinction between mass and force in physics by
Equation (4): the former is a scalar quantity which is indeed
constantly intrinsic to a system, whereas the latter is a dynamical
characteristic of motion defined by a vector quantity of a system’s
action that can vanish in inertial states.

FIGURE 1

Brain criticality and conscious experience. (A) In large-scale brain dynamics, conscious states emerge at critical points near phase transitions
between synchronization (order) and desynchronization (disorder) patterns of neural activity at the microscale. (B) The map m transforms each
critical point of brain dynamics, described in a phase space, onto the whole-brain network N in a vector space as a particular NCC responsible
for a certain conscious state at that moment of time. (C) The stream of consciousness can then be formalized as a discrete chain of states (N dimensional vectors) and studied in causal dynamical modeling as a directed acyclic graph. (D) In neural pleiotropy, many neurons constitute a
particular NCC for producing a certain conscious percept, thereby involving a single neuron in generating very different percepts. (E) Conscious
experience is a product of unconscious computations initiated by the brainstem at the hard level and accomplished by various thalamocortical
systems at the soft level.

Only states that emerge globally and are integrated at
critical points are conscious. In the stream, each state appears
instantaneously as a snapshot accompanied by a phenomenal
percept of the “specious present” (Varela, 1999), which provides
human (and most likely animal) observers of the external world
with an egocentric frame of reference, preserving its stability
over time (Seth and Baars, 2005). Due to the cognitive updating
of this self-referential frame by the acquisition of new contents,
consciousness remains well informed at the psyche level about
what is occurring around. Thus, while conscious states emerge
only at discrete critical points of brain dynamics, subjects can still
feel the continuity of being and acquire the illusion of a persistent
presence.
There are also arguments for a continuous flow of conscious
experience (Fekete et al., 2018; Kent and Wittmann, 2021).

Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience

However, these are typically grounded in the phenomenology
of consciousness and time instead of being based on the
neuroscience of consciousness and the physics of time. Yet, they
do it without making a difference between the rigorous notion of
mathematical continuum and something that can be continued.
If such arguments have any merit, their core can be formulated
like this: “If conscious experience is produced by the brain, then
it would seem that there must be a lawful relation between the
state of the brain at the given time and the percept that the
person is experiencing. . . because experiencing or perceiving is
an activity, not something to be looked at” (Brette, 2019). Indeed,
such a “lawful relation” must be suggested.
Equation (3) explains how discrete conscious snapshots
at the psyche level can be separated from continuous brain
dynamics at the hard level. Moreover, because consciousness

does not observe how the experience was processed by the brain,
awareness requires no time to be ignited. Since the ignition
across the brain’s workspace occurs phenomenally due to SOC,
there is no dynamical process that should transmit information
into a special site of the brain to reach the subject’s awareness.
Experience is the information the brain has unconsciously
computed at that specious moment τ . The illusion of temporal
continuity of consciousness is merely a trivial corollary of
its self-evidential nature: consciousness cannot in principle
detect its own absence in the brain. Whenever consciousness
searches for itself, the search happens successfully for an obvious
reason: in the stream, consciousness will always be present in
introspection. Likewise, whenever we look in a mirror, we always
see ourselves as if we were constantly there. We know that it is
not true, but it is impossible to catch the mirror before our image
will appear.
In particular, the discreteness of conscious experience
explains how the subjective distortion of perceived temporal
duration produced by emotionally charged events and causing
the sense of dilated time in the stream S(τ ) can occur.
Overestimation of time is associated with many factors such
as enhanced memory encoding or intensive involvement of
the limbic system and the interconnection with medial cortical
areas (Dirnberger et al., 2012). This depends on how the
states were unconsciously processed over multiple timescales
in brain dynamics (Merchant et al., 2013) while their sensorycognitive contents had been compressed over temporal chunks
P
T=
∆t, composed of non-overlapping intervals. Otherwise,
for the sake of continuous conscious perception, we should
agree on something like space-time effects in Relativity theory
as if a perceived chunk T, as compared to a physically real
TR , wouldpindeed be dilated by the Lorenz transformations
T = T R / 1 − υ 2 /c2 . Thus, the discrete model of the stream
S(τ ) proposes a more reasonable and parsimonious explanation
of the subjective distortion in time perception as merely
depending on a ratio T/∆t, i.e., on a variation of ∆t during which
those emotionally charged conscious states were processed.
The passage of time (whatever it is physically) cannot be
perceived at all without sensory-cognitive contents processed by
different brain systems at the soft level and integrated globally
at the psyche level. This also explains why time perception
vanishes completely in altered states of consciousness such
as sleep, anesthesia, or epileptic seizures. It occurs as brain
dynamics deviate from criticality upon which discrete conscious
experience entirely reposes (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016).

m

S(τ ) → x

Thus, each state S(τ ) is represented now by x as a certain
structural-functional configuration of N that is responsible for
that subjective snapshot at the moment τ . The discreteness of
the stream signifies that all the conscious states could, at least
in principle, be naturally enumerated from a subject’s birth, not
merely by a lag in experimental settings.
Let the brain bring consciousness to a state xi at the moment
τ = t. We can rewrite Equation (5) as follows.
ψ (N, t) = xi

(6)

The next conscious state will emerge over the time interval as
ψ (N, t + 1t) = xi + 1

(7)

In the timeless description, the stream S(τ ) is a discrete
causal chain X = (X,<) (Figure 1B), where xi ∈ X and
whose relation < standing for the causal (and temporal)
order is transitive and irreflexive. Here the irreflexivity means
(∀i) xi 6< xi that forbids closed causal loops and, in particular,
instantaneous feedback circuitry in brain dynamics that might
somehow enable consciousness with causal power over the
brain, for example, due to the presumed quantum temporal
back-referral of information in Orch OR (Hameroff and Penrose,
2014). CET strictly rejects the possibility that consciousness
could—classically or quantum-mechanically—choose a state to
arrive at.
Consciousness is a physically classical macro-phenomenon
(though quantum-triggered) that is always local in space and
time. For consciousness, planning something, as discussed in
Alice’s scenario, does not mean to be already in that state.
In other words, every state in S(τ ) is actual, and any chosen
state should also be actual. However, it is physically impossible
for the brain or for the stream of consciousness to be ahead
of itself. Physically, the brain is exactly where it is. Mentally,
consciousness is what it is just now. Even assuming quantum
temporal back-referral, closed causal loops would be involved,
as if consciousness would be now in a state it had already chosen
in the state before. On any account, this would imply that before
choosing a state consciousness should already be in that state
despite irreflexivity.
Herzog et al. (2016) suggest a discrete model of
consciousness very similar to that of CET. The authors
assume that conscious states represent integrated, meaningful
outputs of unconscious (modular) computations carried out at
the soft level which had been causally provided by dynamical
attractors at the hard level of interacting neurons. They compare

a conscious snapshot with a k-dimensional feature vector Vi
that contains a value for each relevant feature i of an external
stimulus (e.g., color, size, shape, or position), which together
constitute a meaningful post-hoc representation of the event
processed unconsciously during an interval ∆t. The interval
is the period of sense-making (Herzog et al., 2016). CET
transforms their model, based on a statistical presentation of
an external stimulus by a feature vector Vi , into an internal
neuron-based representation of that stimulus in the brain
network N. Namely, in the chain X = (X,<), each snapshot
S(τ ) is a particular NCC described by a N-dimensional vector
xi = [n1 , n2 ,..., nN ] that constitutes a given conscious state which
is responsible for the perceived stimulus at that time.
The stream of consciousness can now be represented in
terms of dynamical causal networks formalized typically as a
directed acyclic graph Gu = (N,E), where edges E indicate
not synaptic connections but cause-effect pairs among a set of
nodes N which in turn represent a set of associated random
variables with a state space  = 5i Ni , based on a given set
of background conditions (states of exogenous variables) U = u
(Albantakis et al., 2019). The representation can be made by
mapping the temporal evolution of the brain network N onto
the acyclic graph. Accordingly, the chain X can be defined in
Gu by a partition of its nodes N into temporally ordered slices,
N = N 1 , ..., N k , each interpreted as a particular NCC of a discrete
dynamical system starting with an initial slice N1 ∼
= x1 and such
that the parents of each next slice are fully contained within the
previous slice. This definition prohibits any instantaneous causal
loops and signifies that Gu (hence X) fulfills the Markov property
(Figure 1C).

occur in the context of other experiences (Figure 1D). Thus, one
might then consider how different NCC might be mapped onto
a state space of phenomenal experience to account for qualia
at the psyche level (Kraikivski, 2020). However, CET specifies
that the problem of the privacy of consciousness cannot be
solved abstractly. Secured privacy is guaranteed by the NFVM,
preventing the possibility of copying one’s unique consciousness.
Generally, the search for a physical substrate S for some P
makes sense if P is a well-defined phenomenon accessible to
objective experience. Here, the objective can be replaced by the
collectively subjective, something that everyone can experience
independently. For example, if P means the Moon, this is
well-defined under objective experience: we all understand that
the Moon means an object in the night sky which is accessible for
our public evidence. Further, physicists tell us that the physical
substrate S of this P consists of atoms that are already inaccessible
to our public evidence. Instead, we simply believe physicists,
and, in principle, everyone can verify their belief in a lab. Yet,
some people may also believe in ghosts revealed to them in their
subjective experience, but, unlike atoms, these might not even in
principle be tested in a lab for public evidence.
Likewise, when one speaks of consciousness, we all
understand what it means. But this produces a lot of confusion.
Consciousness is ontologically like neither one of these. Unlike
the Moon, consciousness cannot be in principle the object of
our collective experience. Unlike an atom, we do not even need
to believe in its existence because of its self-evidential nature.
Unlike a ghost, it is naturally revealed to all of us with no need
to verify its presence in a lab. Although consciousness is the
necessary prerequisite for the public evidence of the existence of
anything, it itself is neither well-defined nor even a phenomenon
under objective experience. Thus, the empirical search for NCC
cannot be theory-neutral but depends on how consciousness is
conceptualized (Pauen, 2021). How might the NCC be detected
without knowing what exactly the function of consciousness is
and how it has evolved?2
The NCC program, as initiated by Crick and Koch, has
been explicitly based on the idea of active consciousness. This
allowed the authors to propose the search for neural correlates
of visual consciousness which should “produce the best current
interpretation of the visual scene in the light of past experience

Neural correlates of consciousness
According to Equation (5) each conscious state S(τ ) in brain
dynamics can be represented by xi as a particular NCC. The NCC
has been traditionally defined as the minimal set of neuronal
events that gives rise to a specific aspect of a conscious percept.
In the context of the binding problem, the NCC should then
be seen not as the static connectivity patterns over anatomical
brain regions but as dynamical and transient networks with
synchronous neural activity as those evolve across the whole
brain in critical dynamics. Klein et al. (2020) argue for what can
be called “neural pleiotropy” in the search for NCC. In biology,
pleiotropy refers to the fact that a single gene can affect a number
of otherwise distinct phenotypic variables.
Accordingly, it can be said that not only many neurons
from different brain areas simultaneously contribute to a single
conscious state xi (a particular NCC) at that moment τ but also
many conscious states are affected by a single neuron, e.g., via
selective participation in producing neuronal avalanches (Bellay
et al., 2021). Thus, a conscious experience at the psyche level
involves multiple phenomenal elements, many of which can

. . .and to make this interpretation directly available, for a
sufficient time, to the parts of the brain that contemplate
and plan voluntary motor output” (Crick and Koch, 2003).
The program had quickly been divided into two parts: the
search for the level of consciousness and the search for the
cognitive (reportable) contents of specific NCC (Miller, 2007;
Hohwy, 2009). The former was explicitly concentrated on the
diagnostic assessments of coma/level of arousal in humans,
tested for instance with the Glasgow Coma scale or Coma
Recovery Scale-revised, while the latter remained concerned
with conscious (mostly visual) perception vs. unconscious
processing in experimental studies on awake subjects.
These in turn generated a lot of cognate concepts
such as prerequisites of consciousness (preNCC), proper
correlates (NCCpr), their consequences (NCCcons), and others
(Bachmann and Hudetz, 2014; Northoff and Zilio, 2022). CET
is not involved in all of these. CET denies active consciousness,
thereby reducing the importance of cortical regions for the study
of NCC. CET argues that the search for true NCC suggested as
an “easy part” of the hard problem (Crick and Koch, 2003) is an
attempt to sidestep the privacy of consciousness in the same way
as the Turing test attempts to do it by obtaining a machine report.
Instead, CET decomposes the concept of NCC into separated
neural configurations that are responsible for different conscious
states. In principle, one can uncover an NCC for any particular
state x = [n1 , n2 ,..., nN ] by merely detecting activity patterns in
N at that moment τ . The minimal neural substrate can then be
defined by the intersection of all those states over the stream
S(τ ), or, more generally, as
N

NCCmin = ∩2i = 1 xi

Naccache, 2018; Aru et al., 2019). However, the premise that
consciousness is active in brain dynamics claims much more
than the NCC program has suggested—to account for the
minimal neural substrate that is necessary and sufficient to ignite
consciousness in critical points of brain dynamics. The premise
makes legitimate the use of such terms as “conscious processing”
in parallel with unconscious processing.
CET denies the possibility of conscious processing that
would be active and continuous over the stream S(τ ) of discrete
conscious states. This argues that the integration of neural
activity, associated with a particular conscious state emerging
at the psyche level, cannot be dissociated from underlying
cognitive and volitional processes at the soft and hard levels
respectively. Some regions in the front or in the back of the
cortex that are thought to be relevant in the NCC debate (Boly
et al., 2017) are also involved in various functions that are
necessary for volition and cognition, e.g., the supplementary
motor area in Libet-type free will experiments, or the inferior
parietal cortex and many corticothalamic loops in predictive
processing. However, in CET, consciousness is derived from
brain dynamics only as a mental force, it cannot persist without
volition and cognition, and completely fades if there is no space
for the cognitive evolution when brain dynamics depart from
criticality (as in coma, epileptic seizures, and general anesthesia).
Thus, contrary to the idea of active consciousness, advocated
by many theories of consciousness, CET takes an “inverted
perspective”: consciousness is a passive phenomenon, ignited
at critical points of brain dynamics and resulting from
unconscious computational processes implemented by various
thalamocortical functional systems. When distilled from those
processes, conscious states emerge as a mental marker of brain
dynamics, by analogy with the physical force as a dynamical
marker of a moving system. This is the subjective experience that
makes a difference over time from its own perspective, thereby
acquiring the illusion of causal power over neural activity3 .

Here 2N is a set of all possible states (from full vigilance to sleep,
or coma) a subject might have during his lifetime. To identify
which minimal correlates are necessary for consciousness,
we need to associate it with the most primitive core of
subcortical consciousness presented in infants born without
the telencephalon (Damasio et al., 2012; Aleman and Merker,
2014; Barron and Klein, 2016; Panksepp et al., 2017) or even
in patients with the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (see
Section “Mental force in critical brain dynamics”).
Otherwise, if we assume an active role of consciousness
(i.e., free will) in an attentional effort, active inference, decisionmaking, planning, and goal-directed behavior, the NCC would
comprise most of the brain, including even the cerebellum
(Schmahmann, 2010; Friston and Herreros, 2016) that is
generally not considered in the NCC debate,

Recall, in CET, discrete conscious states are exposed to the
psyche level as the ultimate decision of cognitive (predictive and
unconscious) processing at the soft level (Yurchenko, 2022). These
decisions form the stream S(τ ) in the physical time continuum with
temporal resolution by 1t. For example, if placed between two almost
identical images, excepting a tiny detail, consciousness perceives
each as a whole image (gestalt) per state, gaining then an insight
into the difference. The whole enterprise of making animation movies
relies on this brain’s ability to capture very similar visual scenes
(discrete frames about 24 per second) and to make a difference by

The general idea of linking consciousness to volition and
cognition relies on the observation that they seem always to
be associated with each other (Bachmann and Hudetz, 2014;

the illusion of active consciousness and the illusion of continuous
consciousness converge and make the use of the term “conscious
processing” legitimate in the literature.

neuronal fluctuations. These small neuronal fluctuations were
then amplified to account for reflexes and primary volitional
reactions. Later they were projected to higher thalamocortical
systems to make computations at the soft level.
Thus, CET reduces the active role of consciousness to the
brainstem activation of each conscious state, triggered by the
NFVM [this would happen in the same way as, for instance,
long-lived quantum entanglements in the cryptochromes of the
retina are thought to participate in precise magnetoreception
of the avian compass (Ritz, 2011; Hiscock et al., 2016)]. The
NFVM is necessary to warrant the indeterminism of the
stream based on quantum randomness as emphasized above
(Conway and Kochen, 2008), not merely on a stochastic
(deterministic) account of brain dynamics. Thus, in the stream
S(τ ), all conscious states (but not consciousness) must be
initially Bell-certified against hidden deterministic variables λ by
Equation (1) to be independent from the past.
Many researchers commonly agree that conscious states
represent a simultaneous binding of neural modules, but there
is no agreement regarding the NCC underlying this form of
integration. CET addresses the problem by dividing the NCC
into two parts: a first one that initiated a new conscious state,
and a second part that integrated the cognitive contents of that
state. The neural correlates (NC) of the NFVM (located in the
brainstem) provide the neural basis for the integration of all
states processed by the thalamocortical systems. This makes
the NFVM a necessary and sufficient mechanism to maintain
the sleep-wake cycle in patients with unresponsive wakefulness
syndrome (UWS) after widespread thalamocortical damage
when brainstem activity is more or less preserved (Laureys et al.,
2004),

Instead of discussing different brain regions with their
contributions to subjective experience, e.g., the prefrontal cortex
vs. posterior “hot zones” (Koch et al., 2016; Boly et al., 2017), or
dissociating attention from consciousness (Koch and Tsuchiya,
2007; Nani et al., 2019), CET argues: conscious states emerge as
neural configurations x = [n1 ,...,nN ] at critical points of brain
dynamics, represented then as different NCC. Consciousness
has not played any special role to have its own evolution-driven
neural substrate; it emerges passively from volitional-cognitive
substrates distributed across all regions of the brain (and from
primitive organisms to humans). There is no special NCC
that might causally influence brain dynamics, NCCactive = ∅.
Instead, the NFVM initiates a random micro-event which
can be stochastically amplified by bottom-up causation via
neuronal avalanches to generate a particular conscious state.
Such avalanches are intrinsic to and ubiquitous in critical
dynamics (Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Hahn et al., 2010; Shew et al.,
2011).

Volition in the stream of
consciousness
To account for quantized neuronal events that might cause
avalanches across the brain, CET places the NFVM into the
brainstem (Figure 1E). This derives from the fact that the
brainstem is responsible for spontaneous arousal and vigilance
conducted through the ARAS projecting to the thalamocortical
systems (Paus, 2000; Merker, 2007). Although the cortex is
mostly responsible for elaborating conscious contents, damage
to ARAS and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus can abolish
consciousness (Mhuircheartaigh et al., 2010; Edlow et al., 2020).
Moreover, the neuromodulatory influences of the brainstem
(due to its anatomical location in the neural hierarchy) act as
control parameters of SOC, moving the whole cortex through
a broad range of metastable states, responsible for cognitive
processing in brain dynamics (Bressler and Kelso, 2001). The
NFVM is thus a natural trigger of critical dynamics over which
the stream of consciousness evolves.
Placing the NFVM into the brainstem is also related to
the fact that the brainstem is the oldest brain region that
plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of homeostasis
(Parvizi and Damasio, 2001). Evolutionarily, brains have evolved
gradually as multilevel systems consisting of anatomical parts
that were selection-driven as adaptive modules for executing
specific functions. Any brain function requires an appropriate
neuronal structure able to generate various dynamical patterns
to carry out that function optimally. It is well-known
that the global architecture of the brain is not uniformly
designed across its anatomical parts, which structural signatures
are specialized under corresponding functions. Possibly, the
network characteristics of the brainstem with its reticular
formation were developed to be especially conducive to small

Recovery of consciousness depends then upon the functional
reemergence of the ARAS, which must provide sufficient input
via the thalamic projections to the anterior forebrain mesocircuit
and frontoparietal network (Edlow et al., 2020). Indeed, it is
known that full recovery from UWS can be accompanied by
restoration of activity in frontoparietal areas (Giacino et al.,
2014). In contrast, brainstem lesions cause immediate coma
by damaging the ARAS and its associated neuromodulatory
systems (Parvizi and Damasio, 2001). Thus, if the NFVM is
severely damaged, no conscious state could be initiated in
brain dynamics, even when thalamocortical systems remained
completely or partially intact,

The NFVM could also account for subcortical conscious
experience in infants born without the cortex, on the condition
of some preserved islands of the limbic system coupled with
arousal centers. This goes in line with Merker’s proposal that the

14

frontiersin.org

Yurchenko

10.3389/fnint.2022.928978

stream of consciousness derives from the interactions within the
brainstem, supporting the triangle of action-target-motivation,
while the thalamocortical systems provide cognitive contents
for “immediate, unreflective experience” (Merker, 2007). For
example, experimental evidence shows that decorticated rats
preserve consciousness driven by volition (NFVM) from the
brainstem, but often exhibit hyperactive wandering and more
emotional behavior than their neurologically intact siblings
whose behaviors are just suppressed and cognitively modulated
by the cortex (Panksepp et al., 1994).

sensory responsiveness (Giacino et al., 2014; Schiff et al., 2014).
According to Equation (10), in these conditions, the NFVM
should still be preserved within the brainstem to maintain
arousal cycles with the lowest level of conscious experience,
whereas thalamocortical systems responsible for cognitive
(unconscious) processing would be severely suppressed. It also
explains why patients who recovered after UWS have no
memories of their staying in that state as if time perception was
also broken (Gosseries et al., 2014).
Now replace the frog with a Bell-certified random number
generator producing a string of numbers a Turing machine
could not compute. Let the numbers symbolize conscious states,
totally disconnected over the stream. The stream of such states
would be unpredictable in favor of free volition. On the other
hand, as the brain has to make its own predictions about the
world, cognition and logical reasoning should be unguided
in this case because a subject having those states could not
concentrate on a task to gain a coherent insight into it. The
subject could then be viewed as going among many arbitrary
frames (thoughts), while the information gain (as estimated
by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the
posterior), would be too big to make a consistent difference from
the past.
Perhaps, similar conditions might characterize attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the literature. Its
typical symptoms are disorganization, impulsiveness, trouble
with focussing on tasks, and low attention span (Salmi et al.,
2020). In this disorder, consciousness, as the way of being
(Tononi, 2008), is ill-adaptive to the environment. How can
free volition be manifested there? CET predicts that ADHD can
occur when the random neural event initiated by the NFVM
and transmitted by the ARAS up to the thalamocortical systems
cannot be normally modulated by these parts of the NCC.
Whatever the neurophysiological reasons of it may be, there is
evidence that critical phenomena are involved in ADHD (e.g.,
Zimmern, 2020; Heiney et al., 2021; Rocha et al., 2022).

Consciousness as a mental force
In Newtonian mechanics, the force is a time derivative of
the momentum. But there are no things such as the force and
the momentum; these are only the dynamical characteristics of
a moving system. Similarly, consciousness can be derived—in
any meaningful sense—only from the cognitive evolution of the
brain over lifetime. Consciousness is thus no more real than
the force in physics though the latter can be measured and
calculated. Hence, if we will proceed with this conceptualization
of consciousness as a mental force, we need to propose objective
observables that could measure its magnitude at a given time.

Mental force in critical brain dynamics
Before suggesting a candidate measure for consciousness
let us return to the metaphor with a clockwork frog. The only
operation a frog can execute is a jump initiated by its engine
repeatedly with the same magnitude of physical force, F = ma.
The frog will make the same jump over and over regardless of
how the environment changes. To continue the analogy between
this force, triggered by the frog’s engine at discrete moments of
time, and the brain’s mental force, ignited momentarily at critical
points of brain dynamics, we need to compare the iteration of the
same jump with the alternation of conscious states.
In the stream, each state must make a difference from the
past (Edelman, 2003) to gain an insight into what occurs around
it. Thus, a mental jump at the psyche level over discretized
time τ provides consciousness with new knowledge that can be
viewed as Bayesian updating of prior beliefs in the framework
of predictive processing models at the soft (unconscious) level.
What follows is that the same conscious state, experienced by a
subject repeatedly, would be like a freeze-frame on a TV screen,
yet, preserving the same mental force. The brain, generating
every time the same snapshot, could not make a difference from
the past to learn something. Accordingly, memory networks
should have nothing to update over the stream of such states.
Perhaps, just these conditions are presented in UWS that,
unlike coma, is accompanied by spontaneous eye and limb
movements without evidence of goal-oriented behavior or

Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience

Neural complexity as a measure of
consciousness
According to Equation (3), conscious states can emerge only
near criticality while the brain moves from a subcritical regime
where excitation dies out to a supercritical regime accompanied
by neuronal avalanches (Haldeman and Beggs, 2005; Chialvo,
2010). SOC maintains a long-term correlation of brain regions to
provide optimal information storage and computational power
on the edge between order and disorder (Figure 2A). In CET,
consciousness is like a river buoy fluctuating on the surface of
water regardless of its depth. The behavior of such a float can
well characterize underwater dynamical processes (for example,
in fishing or navigation) without, however, having any influence
on those complex and invisible processes.

Critical dynamics, phase transitions and the NFVM. (A) In critical dynamics, one neuron excites another and causes avalanches of activity spreading
across N and obeying the power law of distribution. The brain exhibits a broad range of flexible patterns of coordinated dynamics which decay
after some critical value. While the NFVM initiates avalanches from arousal centers, a decentralized feedback mechanism arises spontaneously
to lead a self-organized system from subcritical to supercritical phases. (B) A simulation of critical phase transitions on the 2D Ising spin lattice
model exhibits different degrees of synchronization or coordination (black dots) from subcritical to supercritical states as temperature (a control

with NCC. The emphasis on the ontological status of Φ
takes some form of panpsychism, and includes the possibility
to ignite consciousness in deterministic machines (Tononi
and Koch, 2015). Unlike IIT, in which the presence of
consciousness itself is conditioned on integrated information
a system is able to generate, CET determines the stream
of consciousness by SOC in Equation (3). The complexity
measure CN has no fundamental property. It is needed
only as an objective (epistemic) observable to evaluate the
mental force of brain dynamics at the given time without
assuming machine consciousness or its ubiquity in matter
like mass.
The main reason to accept CN as a quantitative measure
of consciousness is that the notion of complexity is commonly
conditioned on the same balance between order and disorder.
In statistical physics, it starts by considering the perfect crystal
and the isolated ideal gas as simple classical models of two
extrema. The former represents a maximally ordered state of
a system with entropy H = 0, and the latter symbolizes its
maximally disordered state with H = Hmax , while both have
zero complexity (Lòpez-Ruiz et al., 1995). Yet, just like the
emergence of consciousness conditioned on large-scale brain
dynamics with characteristic temporal scale 1t ≈ 100–450 ms
in CET, the complexity is a scale-dependent concept. This cannot
be measured uniformly because of the contextuality of statistical
analysis itself. According to the third prerequisite (contextuality)
in CET, only SOC with contributions of many brain regions can
ignite consciousness.

Similarly, conscious experience is what has been just exposed
to the psyche level by the brain at a given time; it is a passive
marker of the deep neural processes going at hard and soft levels
of brain dynamics. Now we can suggest a candidate measure
to estimate the mental force of this fluctuating phenomenon,
generally referred to as the level or quantity of consciousness.
Recently, SOC has been proposed as a determinant for
complexity measures of consciousness, mainly with respect to
the concept of integrated information in IIT, based on the
fact that both statistically reflect the same interplay between
integration and segregation in network dynamics exhibiting
scale-free patterning (Sporns, 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Tagliazucchi,
2017; Aguilera, 2019; Kim and Lee, 2019). While the critical
dynamics are characterized by the order parameter, for example,
a mean proportion of activated neurons in N, with the control
parameter depending on connectivity density over time (Hesse
and Gross, 2014), the complexity measures evaluate the degree
of integration of N in a particular state (Timme et al., 2016; Rosas
et al., 2018).
In CET, the consciousness’ objective observables, derived
from brain dynamics at discrete moments τ , will be the
neural complexity measure CN (Tononi et al., 1994). This
would be a more feasible measure, instead of its sophisticated
version (integrated information Φ) that requires computing
distance measures between probability distributions of a system
and finding the minimum information partition (Oizumi
et al., 2014). In IIT, Φ is determined by a major complex
of irreducible causal mechanisms, which is then identified

An obvious limitation of CN is that the measure reflects the
degree of short-term coherency of neural activity irrespectively
to the type of cognitive processing recruited there. This can
apply to disorders of consciousness (Mateos et al., 2018) such
as UWS, but not to mental disorders that depend on long-term
coherency of many conscious states over brain dynamics where
other complexity (algorithmic) measures are preferable (Aboy
et al., 2006; Hager et al., 2017; Murray et al., 2018). On the
other hand, it can be proposed that the level of consciousness,
typically defined by arousal criteria arranged from coma to full
vigilance, is itself irrelevant to cognition. Mashour and Alkire
(2013) argue that while humans exhibit the most advanced
cognitive capabilities, including language, it is difficult to agree
that a fully conscious human has a higher level of consciousness
(alertness) than a beast in pursuit of prey.
Nevertheless, it seems undoubted that cognitive processing
at the soft level of the brain must somehow affect conscious
contents at the psyche level (Yurchenko, 2022). Humans can
significantly differ in acquiring information from the same
environment while preserving equal sensory abilities. It means
that information gain is not affected by their capability to
process sensory signals but depends only on how the signals are
transformed into cognitive contents provided by brain dynamics
(which do not still deviate from criticality). Accordingly, neural
complexity should also differ between healthy humans. The
difference should be especially significant in states of dementia,
where the level of consciousness is preserved despite the
dramatic disruption of cognitive abilities. This is a reason why
CN cannot be a self-sufficient measure of conscious presence.
The problem becomes yet more striking if we draw attention
to the fly’s brain, which should apparently provide a very low
quantity of CN compared to the human brain, maybe, even
lower than in disorders of consciousness. Should we treat the fly
unconscious?
Lamme (2018) recently pointed out that existing theories
have missed a “key ingredient” of consciousness. One of
its consequences is that many of them while being prone
to superdeterminism are at the same time not immune to
panpsychism. Thus, on one hand, they endow consciousness
with causal power, i.e., free will. On the other hand, they
make consciousness a scale-independent phenomenon that can
emerge at the atomic or quantum level (Zeki, 2003; Hunt and
Schooler, 2019), or that can be inherent to a single neuron
or even to a mitochondrion as being ontologically conditioned
on Φ (Tononi and Koch, 2015). Therefore, it is not surprising
that these theories grant consciousness to future machines
(Dehaene et al., 2017). How then should machine consciousness
be compatible with free will controlled by hidden deterministic

(12)

Thus, H(X) = Hmax = log M if X is in equilibrium with
(∀i) pi = 1/M. On the contrary, X has the lowest entropy
H(X) = 0 if X will occupy only a single state with p = 1. These
both comprise the full spectrum of states in which the system X
could be.
In CET, X represents the brain network N which can occupy
M = 2N states. Accordingly, the extrema can be applied to
the two scenarios in cognitive brain evolution described above:
the first with a frog iterating the same jump, and the second
with the random number generator where all states from 2N
configurations are equiprobable. However, it does not propose
a quantitative measure of consciousness. To do it, the neural
complexity focuses on the structural-functional connectivity of
N. This is mathematically equivalent to the average information
exchanged between subsets of a system and the rest of the
system, summed over all subset sizes (ideally, beginning with a
single neuron). The CN can be calculated by mutual information
I obtained for all possible bipartitions of a system N consisting
of N elements,
E
XN/2 D
I(Njk ; N − Njk ) ,
(13)
CN (N) =
k=1

where Njk is the j’th bipartition running over all subsets of size k,
and <· > stands for their average integration. The I is defined as
I(Njk ; N − Njk ) = H(Njk ) − H(Njk |N− Njk )

(14)

CN is highest when synchronization (integration) and
desynchronization (segregation) tendencies are balanced in
N, and lowest under either total synchronization (order) or total
desynchronization (disorder) of its elements. In CET, neural
complexity should provide a measure for information that was
integrated by the brain during a time interval ∆t. This displays
how well the brain is poised near criticality to gain the optimum
information over cognitive brain evolution. Thus, conscious
states can emerge with different values of CN over the full
spectrum of conscious states ranging from UWS to ADHD (as
conditioned above).
The measure will reflect the magnitude of the brain’s mental
force at the given time (Figure 2B). Formally, the level of
consciousness in a particular state S(τ ) equals to the neural
complexity of its NCC presented by a corresponding vector xi .
Unlike Φ in IIT, consciousness does not depend ontologically on
CN . The distinction can be formalized in the language of CET as
follows.

variables λ? Also, what would machine consciousness be if
each atom already possessed some level of consciousness?
CET is immune to both types of panpsychism: the emergence
of consciousness is scale-dependent, whereas CN is only an
epistemic measure of the mental force conditioned on SOC.
Yet, CET asserts that there is no conscious experience
without arousal, one of the four principled features (plus SOC)
of an arbitrary system should satisfy to be conscious. Recall,
these features also comprise: (i) living properties; (ii) cognitive
evolution for accumulating knowledge; and (iii) volition not
predetermined from the past. In particular, dreams are often
taken as evidence that consciousness can be separable from
wakefulness (Hobson, 2009; Wamsley, 2013). CET considers
dreams differently as the evidence that (passive and discrete)
consciousness is complementary to unconscious (active and
continuous) cognitive processing, which can persist during REM
sleep by involving a parieto-occipital “hot zone” that is typically
associated with the cortex-centered NCC (Siclari et al., 2017).
CET argues that without activating arousal centers there can be
no immediate awareness of something experienced.
As stated, conscious experience is always local in space and
time. To be conscious means to be conscious of ourselves here
and now while the great gift of imagination can allow us to
virtually travel over space and time. Similarly, on retrospection,
we can be conscious of what we were doing yesterday or many
years ago, but it occurs just now, at the specious present (Varela,
1999). Importantly, we are not conscious while dreaming but we
recall what the brain has unconsciously processed just before
awakening. Dreams are residual (cortex-centered?) memory the
brain can or cannot expose to the psyche level. Indeed, we do not
retain dreams every time by awakening.
Yet, we know that all animals, even those endowed with
a primitive neutral system, can be anesthetized (Zalucki and
van Swinderen, 2016) but there is no “anesthesia” for arbitrary
natural or artificial systems like atoms or machines. The arousal
centers—even if very different in worms, insects, mollusks, and
vertebrates—are that crucial ingredient (Lamme, 2018), without
which neither consciousness nor any kind of free will is possible.
Thus, consciousness, being inseparable from arousal, could have
expanded over the animal kingdom due to the NFVM. Only the
level of consciousness would have varied over species depending
on the size and architecture of their brain capable of maintaining
SOC.

making. The brain could still remain a deterministic machine
(‘t Hooft, 2016; Hossenfelder and Palmer, 2020). Apparently,
the only alternative is to adopt quantum indeterminism. The
question is then: How to rigorously incorporate the quantum
effects into classical stochastic brain dynamics? This problem
has produced several quantum proposals in the science of
consciousness. First, CET differs from all of them because
it does not involve any macroscopic quantum effects that
might arguably be exploited by consciousness to speed up the
computational power of the brain, and make consciousness
non-computable (Fisher, 2015) or even transiently separable
from the brain due to closed causal loops (Hameroff and
Penrose, 2014).
To CET, quantum indeterminism is not a matter of
conscious will, but a matter of evolution of life and origins
of consciousness. CET argues that consciousness has no free
will but brain dynamics can be free of predetermination in a
physically meaningful sense by the minimal use of quantum
randomness via Beck-Eccles exocytosis. At the same time,
Libet-type experiments are all initially cortex-centered by
neglecting one obvious neurobiological fact. Wakefulness is a
necessary prerequisite of any manipulations with consciousness
to detect perception, attention, and cognition as compared to
unconscious processing. Neither consciousness nor volition is
possible without activating arousal centers.
First, CET rules out conscious will which allegedly might
have power over brain dynamics at the soft (computational)
level by deciding ahead of time what goal will be achieved (as
described above in Alice’s scenario). Second, CET also rejects a
statistical (probabilistic) account of volition resulting from noisy
neural fluctuations in a stochastic framework (Khalighinejad
et al., 2018) because such account of randomness depends
ultimately on the state of our knowledge which by itself does
not violate determinism. CET then takes the NFVM as a
principled argument against superdeterminism, which is the
hypothesis that conscious observers cannot act freely or do
otherwise than what has been predetermined by deterministic
laws of nature. This hypothesis has been suggested with the
claim “to remove every single bit of mysticism from quantum
theory” (‘t Hooft, 2016) such as a random wavefunction
collapse caused by observation or nonlocal (faster than light)
correlations between a pair of entangled particles. Nevertheless,
contrary to this reasonable claim, superdeterminism would
inevitably lead to much more mysterious implications such
as “cosmic conspiracies” in Bell-type experiments (Gallicchio
et al., 2014) or, more generally, a “designed” universe
where conscious beings, controlled by hidden deterministic
variables λ, do what the universe wants them to do
(Yurchenko, 2021b).
Leaving aside these metaphysical issues, CET looks at this
problem from an evolutionary perspective on the origins of
life and consciousness. Might life have evolved from completely
deterministic cause-effect interactions? What advantages would

Discussion
CET adheres to the evidence derived from Liber-type
experiments that consciousness is a passive post-factum
phenomenon of neural activity with no causal power over
brain dynamics. Unfortunately, the free-will experiments have
little to say about how the neural activity itself might be free
of predetermination in unconscious processing of decision-

organisms have gained over non-living systems in following
the same predetermined ways? Why should consciousness have
then evolved from the simplest forms of life? Contrary to the
idea that life is a triumph of determinism (Marshall et al.,
2017), CET argues that organisms should initially be free
of predetermination to have any meaningful difference from
non-living systems to evolve from simplest to complex forms
of life. In this way, the evolution of the brain would have
been driven by the natural selection from primitive neuronal
bundles to higher-level neural systems to supply their freedom
to maneuver with computational power in an efficient prediction
of the environmental events (Brembs, 2011).
This lays a principled division between the cause-effect
interactions, reserved for dynamics of non-living systems of
any complexity, and the stimulus-response repertoires accessible
for all organisms. The repertoires can emerge only from the
corresponding neural activity. A lesson we have learnt from
biology is that every useful mechanism will be re-used by
evolution to promote new more sophisticated mechanisms for
adaptive advantages of life. The fast and random reflexes of the
simplest organisms could have evolved from quantized microevents that are abundantly presented in cellular structures of
plants and animals (Arndt et al., 2009; Brookes, 2017). The
evolution of the brain might have then used those reflexes
to build up a neural mechanism like the NFVM in the same
way as random (quantum in origin) gene mutations underlie
the biological machinery that is responsible for the astonishing
variety of species on the Earth. CET places the NFVM into
the brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient brain region that
comprises various nuclei responsible for executing many vital
autonomic functions to maintain homeostasis.
Remarkably, those autonomic functions are typically called
“involuntary” in the literature, while voluntary functions are
implicitly reserved for conscious volition. The distinction
between voluntary and involuntary functions is the main reason
for confusion leading to postulating free will. Indeed, unlike
reflex-like actions, voluntary actions are by definition those
which were initiated consciously. On the other hand, volition
must have by definition causal power. Thus, one naturally comes
to free will via the distinction. In contrast, CET considers all
autonomic and unconscious functions just voluntary, i.e., not
predetermined from the past even in unicellular organisms
placed upon the psyche-matter division between cause-effect
interactions and stimulus-reaction repertoires (Figure 3).
This requires a paradigm shift akin to that of the Copernican
heliocentrism that had turned upside down the humans’ belief
that the Sun revolves around the Earth as they indeed saw it
in everyday experience. Similarly, humans believe they have
free will to choose the course of future actions under given
conditions. Note, CET does not univocally deny this ambiguous
formulation. If humans are associated with what their brain
does, the brain can indeed make a choice that had not been
predetermined from the past. This scenario is possible on

Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience

the condition that the choice is causally triggered at the hard
level by the NFVM in the arousal centers of the brainstem.
The quantized micro-event will then be amplified via neural
scale-free avalanches and cognitively modulated at the soft
level across thalamocortical systems in unconscious ways, and
exposed ultimately to the psyche level.
On the contrary, CET completely denies the assumption that
humans are associated with what their consciousness might do to
their brain (and their body) by intervening in neural activity at
the hard level. In the stream, particular conscious states are what
the brain has periodically generated at critical points of brain
dynamics as it explores its attractor space (yet bombarded by
sensory signals). The only distinction between involuntary and
voluntary actions depends on how the brain processes decisionmaking, which, in turn, depends on the cognitive complexity of a
task. Simple or intermediate tasks as those modeled in multilayer
predictive processing (Pezzulo et al., 2018) will be computed
unconsciously. Only the ultimate decisions of complex tasks will
be exposed to the psyche level as particular conscious states
(which can in principle be measured as the brain’s mental force
at a given moment).
Take for example breathing and heartbeat, both occurring
without necessarily requiring consciousness. We can nonetheless
stop breathing for some time by focusing our attention on this
autonomic process. Advocates of free will take this as an evidence
of the causal power of consciousness. They concede, however,
that we are still unable to stop the heartbeat. Importantly, in CET,
the stream of “pulsating” consciousness is itself like a heartbeat
being every time initiated by the NFVM from arousal centers. At
the same time, meditators trained in yoga practice are believed
to be able to stop their heartbeat too (Krygier et al., 2013;
Vinay et al., 2016). Does it mean that their free will is more
powerful than that of ordinary humans? If so, does it also mean
that free will weakens in humans with mental diseases such as
obsessive-compulsive disorder or schizophrenia? Or is it all a
matter of the cognitive effort and the corresponding state of the
thalamocortical systems?
CET considers wrong saying that “A trained consciousness
can control involuntary heartbeat at its will” or “A cognitively
disrupted consciousness cannot well control even voluntary
behavior at its will”. In both cases, the brain possesses
consciousness as its mental force generated at a given moment
of time. This is what produces the illusion of free will as if
consciousness itself (like a homunculus) “strikes” the force from
the brain to command future actions. Hence, all conscious states
in the stream are already causally driven by the brain like
breathing and heartbeat. They all can be called voluntary on the
authority of the brain. For instance, the experience of “acting
involuntarily” like suddenly reaching out to catch a falling object,
or reflexively removing one’s body from a hot object may arise
because such relatively simple actions can be produced at the
hard level before its stimulus had been exposed to consciousness
at the psyche level.

FIGURE 3

The origins of consciousness. CET starts from the assumption that the brain should have primarily evolved as volitional subsystems of organisms
from simplest neural reflexes based on chemoreceptor, magneto- and photoreceptor cells sensitive to quantum effects. At the causal (hard) level,
the volitional subsystems should provide a principled psyche-matter division between organisms, exploiting their stimulus-reactions repertoires
freely, and non-living systems, governed completely by cause-effects interactions. Placing the NFVM into the brainstem, the oldest brain region
that integrates functions of many vital systems and is responsible for arousal and vigilance guarantees that each conscious state will be triggered
free of predetermination from the past.

CET argues that the stream of consciousness (way of
being) is initially NFVM-driven from arousal centers, and
can be then derived—in any meaningful (formal or informal)
sense—only from cognitive brain evolution (way of knowing).
The brain continuously accumulates information to make an
embodied choice, whereas unitary conscious states appear
instantaneously at critical points of brain dynamics as ultimate
decisions (snapshots) of unconscious action-oriented cognitive
processing (Engel et al., 2013). The stream S(τ ) cannot go
on, though, it can persist like a freeze-frame on a TV screen
if cognitive brain evolution stops and working memory has
nothing to update, as it occurs in patients with UWS when
brain dynamics depart from criticality (Tagliazucchi et al.,
2016; Lee et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020). Indeed, patients
who recovered after UWS have no memories of their time
in rehabilitation as if the stream was “frozen” all the time
(Gosseries et al., 2014).
While the emergence of consciousness from brain
dynamics is commonly accepted, many authors still ascribe to
consciousness a special biological function and active role for

Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience

selective attention, operant learning, and goal-directed behavior
as if evolution had equipped the brain with consciousness just
to perform complex volitional actions, which might not be
performed unconsciously (Pennartz et al., 2019; Feinberg and
Mallatt, 2020; Rolls, 2020). Again, CET does not univocally
deny this conjecture. On one hand, consciousness has never
been the goal of evolution but it has developed gradually from
neural activities of organisms as a global byproduct of their
volitional-cognitive mechanisms, however, with no causal
power in brain dynamics. On the other hand, conscious states
are exposed to the psyche level as ultimate decisions of complex
cognitive tasks processed at that moment.
The laws of Nature make consciousness a necessary
emergent phenomenon of brain dynamics in the same way
as some quantity of H2 O molecules (but not one or two)
placed together will necessarily produce water. Turn now water
into a neuronal substance, add SOC, a volitional (quantum
in origin) mechanism, arousal centers, and learning for
accumulating knowledge: these ingredients will spontaneously
produce consciousness.

parts, a “highway” for conscious processing and an
“underground” for unconscious processing, each requiring
some (iii) neural correlates (workplace) for executing their causal
function in the brain. Rejecting the active role of consciousness
challenges these corollaries as well. First of all, CET operates
exclusively on the stream of consciousness as a discrete chain of
momentary states ignited at/near criticality without assuming
any separate highway for conscious processing. Accordingly,
what we experience as a state of perceptual presence has no
special NCC in the brain but spreads over many brain regions as
those currently involved in volition and cognition.
Moreover, consciousness is not only the phenomenal
experience of something; it implies one’s self-awareness. Perhaps,
the only biological function assigned to consciousness by
evolution is self-awareness, i.e., the ability not only to be but
also to have the sense of being. Consciousness gives the meaning
of life to organisms—not philosophically but biologically: it is
the evolutionary reward of the brain for making its work, over
which the variety of all sensations and all values of being alive
unfold. Life could not have succeeded on Earth if organisms did
not appreciate these values.

Does it mean that the hard problem of consciousness
can be solved? Generally, nothing in CET prevents one
from assuming that future AI systems endowed with these
neuromorphic properties may one day become conscious.
Nevertheless, these machines would be non-deterministic and,
hence, as unpredictable as humans are. In other words, we might
not circumvent Nature in order to create conscious automata like
selfless lackeys. Moreover, such conscious and selfish machines
might not be immune to disorders and psychoses such as
“machine schizophrenia” or “machine depression.” CET argues
that the hard problem as it is related to the search for NCC (Crick
and Koch, 2003) can be better understood by linking it to the
secured privacy of a particular consciousness. If a machine might
know what it is like to be Alice, the uniqueness of her subjective
experience would be uncovered and in principle copyable. Many
machines might have the same qualia. In this sense, subjective
qualia emerging phenomenally at the psyche level of Alice’s brain
are a non-eliminable part of her (and only her) consciousness.
In a conventional view, humans possess free will due to
conscious deliberation. The view seems to be maintained by
plenty of experimental evidence showing that, in contrast to
reflex (autonomic) actions, the cortical function is essential
for volitional control of self-initiated actions (Libet, 1985;
Haggard, 2008; Fried et al., 2011). However, an obvious thing is
neglected in those findings: before executing conscious control
in sensorimotor systems of the cortex, the brain should already
maintain conscious experience due to arousal centers. The
cortex-centered account of free will in Libet-type experiments
loses its validity the moment one realizes that no kind of volition
can be ascribed to a subject in coma after brainstem lesions
(Laureys et al., 2004).
CET proposes a paradigm shift based on an evolutionary
and physically rigorous perspective, contrary to the conventional
view: humans possess consciousness due to a volitional
(Bell-certified) mechanism. While rapid and random reflexes
represent the most primitive preconscious form of volitional
motor integration, consciousness is the highest phenomenon
of global integration. In CET, consciousness is like a river
buoy fluctuating on the surface of water regardless of its depth.
On the other hand, precisely because of its representative
and “superficial” nature in brain dynamics, the stream of
consciousness is the marker the brain has exposed to its
environment (including external observers) in a meaningful
sense.

temporally continuous to implement its own (ii) conscious

The increasing visibility of neuroscience employed in legal contexts has rightfully
prompted critical discourse regarding the boundaries of its utility. High profile debates
include some extreme positions that either undermine the relevance of neuroscience
or overstate its role in determining legal responsibility. Here we adopt a conciliatory
attitude, reaffirming the current value of neuroscience in jurisprudence and addressing
its role in shifting normative attitudes about culpability. Adopting a balanced perspective
about the interaction between two dynamic fields (science and law) allows for more
fruitful consideration of practical changes likely to improve the way we engage in legal
decision-making. Neuroscience provides a useful platform for addressing nuanced and
multifaceted deterministic factors promoting antisocial behavior. Ultimately, we suggest
that shifting normative attitudes about culpability vis-à-vis advancing neuroscience are
not likely to promote major changes in the way we assign legal responsibility. Rather,
it helps us to shed our harshest retributivist instincts in favor of more pragmatic
strategies for combating the most conspicuous patterns promoting mass incarceration
and recidivism.
Keywords: neurolaw, neuroscience, jurisprudence, free will, determinism, culpability, intervention

INTRODUCTION
Increasing attention is being devoted to the emerging roles of neuroscience in legal decisionmaking, both in academic settings and in the courtroom. Among these roles is the growing
influence neuroscience has in reinforcing more deterministic models of human decision-making
and behavior. In a deliberate attempt to (over)simplify this complex landscape, it seems that there
are roughly two camps in these conversations. The first includes those who promote the idea that
neuroscience has mostly “disproved” the existence of free will, which subverts some of our ordinary
notions of accountability. Prominent voices in popular media have indeed heralded the end of
free will (Harris, 2012; Cave, 2016), calling into question our most basic presumptions about the
legitimacy of punitive justice (Burns and Bechara, 2007; Sapolsky, 2017). As a consequence, the
criminal justice system, which punishes people on a now-baseless presumption of freedom and
agency, has been foundationally undermined and must therefore be replaced immediately with
something more enlightened and fair. Expectedly, such claims have incited substantial opposition
and motivated counter-arguments aimed at substantiating traditional views of legal responsibility

and the enduring value of retributive sanctions against criminal
actions. This opposing camp includes those who claim that free
will (whether it exists or not) is largely irrelevant to basic notions
of legal responsibility, and neuroscience has little to no relevance
for assessing guilt or any ordinary sense of civic accountability.
As such, the status quo can be safely perpetuated, and the law,
as it stands, remains unfettered by trifling nuisances of predetermined actions. Perhaps as a kind of contrecoup effect, these
counter arguments often involve rebuffing the very relevance
of neuroscience in the legal process more generally (Morse,
2006; Pardo and Patterson, 2010; Chambon and Bigenwald,
2019). Of course these descriptions are composite caricatures
of many subtler perspectives available in this growing academic
conversation, e.g. Vincent (2013). Still, many of the arguments
we read these days overlap substantially and obviously with
one of these two extreme positions. Without depreciating the
zeitgeist of this revolution or its opponents, we recognize the need
for some conservatism in advancing pragmatic attitudes about
how the legal system might change in the wake of advancing
neuroscience. We therefore set out here to willfully explore the
vast middle ground between seemingly extreme perspectives in
this conversation. We ultimately promote three main theses
related to Neurolaw and its inevitable progress.

NEUROSCIENCE HAS FIRMLY
ESTABLISHED ITS PLACE IN
JURISPRUDENCE
Critical evaluations of the role of neuroscience (and particularly
neuroimaging) in legal proceedings abound in both academic
publications and the popular media (Brown and Murphy, 2010;
Eagleman, 2011a; Morse, 2015; Gonzalez, 2017). While the tone
of these pieces can range from cautionary to insolent, they attend
to a common issue of what is frequently described as a meteoric
rise in the consideration of neuroscience-based evidence in
courtroom decision-making. They frequently highlight perceived
negative consequences of this trend, and some suggest the limited
relevance of neuroimaging in court overall. Here we argue
that neuroscience and neuroimaging in particular have already
established their place in legal proceedings, which is unlikely to
subside. A more practical approach for exercising caution in its
application will be to improve stakeholders’ understanding of
the strengths and limitations of these techniques which includes
educating lawyers, judges, and the general public. Educated
adoption of neuroscience in legal settings is a practical and
realistic solution to any perceived hazards it engenders.
The characterization of a meteoric rise of neuroscience used
in court carries with it a somewhat menacing connotation that
may not be wholly justified. While estimates have suggested an
approximate doubling of cases that consider neuroscience data
as legal evidence in the past decade (Catley and Claydon, 2016;
Farahany, 2016), this is not out of step with its rise in clinical
and research settings over the same period (Yeung et al., 2017).
Further, in contrast to the tone of many commentaries, this
steady increase has not occurred unexpectedly, overwhelming
courts with claims that its practitioners cannot fairly evaluate.
One of the first considerations of brain imaging as evidence in
court occurred over 35 years ago in the high profile trial of
John Hinckley Jr. for the attempted assassination of President
Ronald Reagan (United States vs. Hinckley, 19821 ). Brain
scans were used in conjunction with other clinical evidence
to support Hinckley’s diagnosis of schizophrenia. The brain
imaging was not foundational to his diagnosis, but served
the purpose of grounding his claims of mental illness in a
physical domain (as opposed to purely “psychological”) – an
important educational element for jurors in the early 1980s. This
context remains among the most influential roles of neuroscience
in contemporary jurisprudence, where judges and juries must
inevitably weigh the “legitimacy” of health claims and related
assertions that remain difficult to account for objectively (e.g.,
chronic pain, psychiatric disorders). Hinckley was found not
guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to a secure
hospital for the mentally ill.
Since then, the application of neuroscience evidence in court
has increased, but not on a scale that is out of step with advancing
scientific knowledge and improved practical utility. Any notions
that the rise in neuroscience has happened too quickly for courts
to implement its data sagaciously are likely misguided. Several

Neuroscience Has Firmly Established Its
Place in Jurisprudence
Neuroscience already plays a prominent role in legal proceedings.
This trend seems likely to increase rather than decrease; however,
this development should not be alarming. As judges and juries
are faced with the challenge of weighing this evidence in their
decision-making, we have a responsibility to make this process
as transparent as possible. This involves promoting better science
and better education to judges and legal counsel about these data’s
interpretation, limitations, and best practices in quality assurance
and analytic strategies.

Our Normative Understanding of Free
Will and Culpability Is Changing
Our understanding of human behavior and free will has steadily
incorporated more contributions from science throughout
history. The role of neuroscience only represents a recent and
specific extension of this progress. Increasingly deterministic
models of behavior need not cripple our aim to hold people
responsible for their actions, but they arguably drive changes in
our normative view of culpability and what constitutes justice.

Our Legal System Is Evolving, Not Static
Recent changes in our legal system highlight evolving standards
in normative judgments regarding the relative value of retributive
and rehabilitative interventions. Neuroscience provides a
platform to re-assess the value of primarily punitive systems
that have historically done little to remedy mental health
and social issues that perpetuate high incarceration rates.
Rather than eroding jurisprudence, this has the potential
to inform more effective policies that serve our society in
progressive ways.

diagnosed with a mental illness (Kirschner and Galperin, 2001;
Perlin, 2016).
As noted above, neuroscience data is also increasingly
submitted in the sentencing phase of a trial (e.g., after guilt
has already been determined), and evidentiary standards are
somewhat more permissive and accommodating during these
arguments. This is becoming more common in high stakes
sentencing decisions, for instance, in capital cases when the
convicted offender faces either the death penalty or life in
prison (Miller, 2010). Neuroscience data may then be considered
relevant when deciding whether one deserves the harshest
possible punishment or a sentence reflecting intervening factors
that can include mental health status. Indeed the relevance of
mental health in some cases is considered so pertinent that a
failure to introduce neuroscience data has been determinative of
ineffective counsel and a violation of a defendant’s constitutional
right to fair representation (Koenig, 2016).
Additional applications of neuroscience arise in civil cases,
which may require demonstrating extent of physical injury.
Applications of brain imaging in this context include established
documentation of gray and white matter injury with structural
brain imaging, but may extend to novel applications that provide
information on concussion and mild traumatic brain injury
(Vergara et al., 2017), and application of functional imaging
techniques addressing chronic pain (Wager et al., 2013). These
later examples are emerging areas that need to be vetted further
by the scientific community (Davis et al., 2017); however,
their appeal and potential value is undeniable, underscoring
the importance of lawyers and judges remaining in touch
with advancing technology. In this way, it is imperative that
legal counsel is adequately educated about the relevance and
interpretation of neuroscience-based evidence that may aid the
fair evaluation of each case.
It should be clear that, in any context, the tools of neuroscience
are not subject to more lenient standards than other forms of
evidence presented in legal arguments. That is, their probative
value must be weighed against the potential for introducing a
prejudicial impact or confusion among jurors. Commentaries
often use this as a linchpin for their arguments, citing (limited)
evidence that brain imaging evidence may mislead jurors
and/or distract them from primary lines of reasoning (McCabe
and Castel, 2008; Weisberg et al., 2008). Importantly, this
evidence has been critically evaluated by others who have
noted that these investigations did not present information in
a context matching what juries typically encounter (Roskies
et al., 2013). Other studies accounting for these factors have
indicated no evidence that brain imaging carries any additional
weight over and above verbal neuroscience-based testimony
(Schweitzer and Saks, 2011; Schweitzer et al., 2011). Further,
when evaluated in a legal context where cross-examination
critically evaluates the relevance of information, MRI-based
evidence is no more persuasive than other (non-neurosciencebased) evidence (McCabe et al., 2011). Finally, the role of the
judge as a kind of gatekeeper for admissibility of evidence protects
the system from more controversial applications of these tools.
This has been demonstrated effectively time and again as courts
have rejected the use of fMRI, for example, as a form of lie

reports have objectively evaluated this changing landscape. Using
broad inclusive criteria, it has been estimated that neuroscience
evidence is considered in less than 1% of all criminal proceedings
(based on court of appeals data) and only about 5% of murder
trials dating back to 2005 (Catley and Claydon, 2016; De Kogel
and Westgeest, 2016; Farahany, 2016). Contexts that have seen
more pronounced increases include evaluation of competency
to stand trial, capital cases, and appeals for mitigation of
punishment. An observation made frequently across studies is
that the rise in neuroscience evidence appears most striking in
high-stakes cases. While these numbers are steadily increasing,
they do so in-step with advancing scientific understanding and
improved potential to inform judges and juries about a number
of relevant aspects of mental health, within standard limits
of due process – and this context is important. As with any
emerging technology, its relevance in legal proceedings must
be evaluated carefully with established evidentiary standards
(Gaudet, 2011) as courts learn to integrate and adapt to progress
in clinical neuroscience. Nonetheless, the utility of neuroscience
and neuroimaging data in court is being increasingly realized
as counsel, scientists, and practitioners work together to further
establish its value in different contexts. Indeed, courts are often
recommending, if not requiring, that neuroscience evidence be
produced to support arguments being made, when these data are
potentially informative (Catley and Claydon, 2016).
Understanding the many possible applications of
neuroscience in the courts can help broaden this perspective and
allay concerns that its arrival in legal proceedings is premature or
imprudent. First, neuroscience evidence in the United States has
almost never been an essential factor in determining actus reus –
whether or not the accused actually committed the criminal
act in question. However, for an interesting international
example see State of Maharashtra v. Sharma2 . and commentary
by Gaudet (2011). Neuroscience evidence, in the U.S. and
worldwide, is far more commonly determined to be relevant
for assessing the competency of an individual to stand trial or
in addressing the mens rea element of criminal liability, but
for a more nuanced summary of these various contexts see
Slobogin (2017). These latter contexts relating to mens rea often
require thorough assessments of a defendant’s mental health,
which may reasonably include neuroimaging. Defenses built
on this reasoning include pleas of insanity, which have evolved
substantially over time (see section Our legal system is evolving,
not static). Nonetheless, insanity pleas essentially argue that
someone was so mentally impaired that s/he was not aware of
their own actions, or able to decipher right from wrong. Still, a
brain scan may only represent one element of a comprehensive
clinical evaluation in such applications, or may be determined
to be irrelevant given extant clinical evidence – that is, a brain
scan is often not necessary for determining ones mental health
status, but may provide supportive evidence. In other cases,
neuroimaging may be essential (e.g., brain injury, degenerative
disease, tumors). To be sure, insanity pleas overall constitute
less than 1% of all felony trials, and their success ordinarily
accompanies cases in which a defendant had previously been

detection (US v. Semrau, 20103 ; State v Gary Smith 20124 .). This
has persisted as there is not sufficient scientific consensus for
these purposes, at present. As such, the use of fMRI in this context
does not pass established Daubert standards of evidence.
The checks and balances built into the U.S. legal system
have largely been effective in the face of expanding neuroscience
evidence. It should be clear, however, that these safeguards
are not intended to unilaterally prevent change in the
legal system. Rather, they are intended to promote adaptive
interpretation, reflecting normative standards that shift in
step with increasing knowledge, advancing technology, and
evolving public attitudes (see section “Our legal system is
evolving, not static”). As technology continues to improve and
new applications arise, it is essential for practitioners of the
law to remain adequately informed in order to best serve
their roles. The recognition of this imperative is increasingly
evident in the resources and attention being devoted to these
objectives in recent years (Jones et al., 2013). The MacArthur
Foundation Law and Neuroscience project and the Research
Network on Law and Neuroscience (MacArthur, 2019) represent
large, multimillion dollar investments serving these needs.
These efforts accompany many formal educational resources
for judges and lawyers that specifically address topics of
neuroscience (FJC, 2019), as well as ongoing development of
many international conferences and academic societies devoted
to increasing scholarship and improving communication within
these integrative disciplines.
Our initial assertion in this commentary is intended to be
uncontentious. Simply, there are many contexts in which the
relevance of neuroscience data is already firmly established,
and may in fact be essential for carrying out effective legal
decision-making. Most of these applications are not new, but
the breadth of their relevance has perhaps widened as their
informative value improves in stride with progress in research
and the technology itself. The relevance of neuroscience data
in jurisprudence shows no evidence of diminishing in the
coming years; therefore, we encourage an attitude of integration
and motivated legal scholarship. The importance of this is
clear even given the limited examples provided here, which
leave out additional concerns regarding constitutional principles
(Pizzetti, 2011), moral/ethical considerations, e.g., PallarésDominguez and Gonzalez Esteban (2016); Shaw (2018), and
Napier (2019), and emerging perspectives in international law
(Spranger, 2012). Ongoing critical evaluation of the utility and
limits of neuroscience will remain an essential component of
this progress. Occasional dismissals of neuroscience’s evolving
relevance, in our view, are myopic and potentially dangerous.
Criticisms on this order are usually intended to reinforce a static
view that the law can continue to operate as effectively without
neuroscience, simply because it has in the past. However, this
attitude offers little guidance for the inevitable progress facing
an assuredly dynamic field, which requires close evaluation of
evolving technology and evidence. We therefore reinforce a
perspective that the best way for the system to adapt to advancing

technology is by improving education and resources available to
legal professionals who are increasingly required to incorporate
these data in their arguments.

OUR NORMATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF
FREE WILL AND CULPABILITY IS
CHANGING
Humans have been grappling with the concepts of free will
and determinism (or fatalism) for most of recorded history
(Hoefer, 2016); however, ancient notions of these concepts
had little to do with the brain and neuroscience. Instead,
philosophers and storytellers alike considered how much of our
behavior was controlled by gods, the fates, or other supernatural
external forces. Similarly, behavior that was attributable to our
own motivations and decisions were not always nested in the
brain. Aristotle for instance believed the brain mostly served to
cool the blood. Rather, our motivated behavior has historically
been attributed to something immaterial like a spirit, soul,
or will. As physical sciences improved our understanding of
neuromuscular junctions, neurotransmitters, and the role of the
brain in organizing behavior based on prior experience, the role
of a soul necessarily diminished. In his book Soul Made Flesh,
Carl Zimmer develops a vivid history of neuroscience around
the idea that advances in physiology, medicine, and psychology
have incrementally narrowed the role of an immaterial soul as
science has increasingly explained biological systems responsible
for cognition and behavior (Zimmer, 2005).
In many ways, evolving perspectives about free will
represent an extension of this trajectory. As neuroscience
offers more detailed and predictive models accounting for
human motivations, appetitive drives, and behavioral inhibition,
extant descriptions of free will increasingly seem to grasp at
something immaterial and elusive. This, somewhat covertly,
promotes a paradigm incompatible with natural science, which
progresses on a foundation that is fundamentally materialist,
reductionist, and determinist in nature. As this represents
a predictable extension of prior historical and philosophical
progress, the questions neuroscience addresses on this topic are
not new ones. However, neuroscience provides an increasingly
tangible and convincing platform for demonstrating the limits,
proximal antecedents, and illusions that support our subjective
sense of free will. The relevance of this for promoting evolving
attitudes in jurisprudence relate to how we, as a society, exercise
normative judgments about agency, responsibility, and most
importantly culpability. Here we illustrate how these attitudes
are slowly shifting, and we emphasize the role neuroscience plays
in influencing these standards.
Any treatment of how neuroscience has influenced our
understanding of free will must address the studies of Benjamin
Libet, and perhaps more importantly, contemporary extensions
of this work. In the 1980s Libet published research demonstrating
the precise timing of one’s subjective perception of making a
simple decision to freely move one’s wrist in relation to other
physiological events (Libet, 1985). The study essentially recorded
three events: the movement of the wrist, the time the participant

conscious, deliberative processes. Better understanding of these
influences has, in some ways, also changed the way we reason
about culpability.
Challengers to the role of neuroscience in legal contexts
will often argue that claims of functional impairments based
in neuroscience contribute little to our normative judgments
about culpability. This is based, in part, on the rationale that
innumerable others with similar impairments have undoubtedly
not committed similar crimes, and so the impairment (by
itself) is insufficient to predestine the crime (Morse, 2006;
Mayberg, 2010). This rebuttal fails to recognize that deterministic
influences rarely operate in isolation, and our normative
judgments ordinarily consider multiple factors and contextual
circumstances (Freedman and Zaami, 2019). Further, the
deterministic limits of isolated factors on criminal behavior are
not uniquely reserved for neuroscientific considerations. This
same argument, for instance, fails to undermine the relevance
of something like faulty brakes influencing our normative
judgments about a fatal car accident, given that faulty brakes
only sometimes lead to fatalities, see also (Zeki et al., 2004).
This perspective also misses a somewhat more overarching role
that neuroscience plays in shifting normative judgments about
culpability. That is, neuroscience can help shift our judgments
by simply grounding facts about psychological differences in a
physical realm, underscoring their contextual relevance among
many forms of physical evidence.
If the processes of motivation and decision-making are seen
only as imponderable mysteries, inaccessible to reductionistic
science, then we are constrained by limited insight into the
origins of behaviors we ostensibly wish to diminish in society. We
are further bound to make more simplistic normative judgments
based on right and wrong, and our interventions will be more
unidimensionally focused on reactive punishment. Conversely,
integrating deterministic perspectives in explaining behaviors
society condemns doesn’t prevent us from using punishment as a
deterrent, but only highlights additional points of leverage useful
for applying more proactive interventions as an added method of
diminishing unwanted behavior, see also Eagleman (2011b) and
Slobogin (2011, 2017).
Another interesting context from which to observe this
evolving landscape is to consider relatively common forms of
pathology that impinge on our ability to choose and behave
freely. Fitting examples include obsessive-compulsive disorders
and addictions. In both cases, individuals can be said to lose
some control over behavior that, in healthy individuals, is
attributed to ordinary volitional processes. Normally, washing
our hands, going over a mental list, or enjoying a beer are all
considered among our ordinary, voluntary, healthy behaviors.
Under pathological conditions, however, compulsions to engage
in these or other behaviors encroach on (and supersede) other
normal motivations. Daily goals, long-term ambitions, and
explicit objectives may be at odds with increasingly intrusive
thoughts and behaviors that an individual has limited control
over. An individual may fully understand, anticipate, and wish to
avoid the consequences of certain maladaptive behaviors, while
still succumbing to well-worn patterns leading to the undesired
behavior. Common understanding about the pathophysiology of

“decided” to move their wrist, and neural activity surrounding
these events. The neural activity indicative of preparations to
move one’s wrist was already known (since the 1960s), and is
commonly referred to as the readiness potential (Kornhuber and
Deecke, 1965). What was striking in Libet’s experiments was the
demonstration that this neural preparatory activity consistently
preceded one’s subjective sense of having decided to move, by
about 350 ms. Preliminary interpretations of these outcomes
suggested that neural activity preceding the decision-point
constituted evidence of a deterministic process that had already
begun, prior to our subjective awareness of it, undermining
conventional notions of agency or free will more generally (Libet,
1999). These initial conclusions have been rightfully debated for
decades, while others have more quietly continued to improve
and expand on these methods.
More recent extensions of this work have included the
application of machine learning algorithms to accurately predict
subjects’ movements before they decide to move. This has been
carried out using intracranial, intracellular recordings within
the supplementary motor cortex (Fried et al., 2011). Functional
MRI recordings measuring patterns of neural activity across the
whole brain have also reliably predicted which of two buttons
someone will press up to 7 s before they indicate they’ve
decided (Soon et al., 2008). However, other exciting research
demonstrates that these behaviors are not determined in such
a simplistic way; but rather, they remain influenced by parallel
cognitive systems. Executive control systems can essentially veto
an intended movement, if given as little as 200 ms warning
(Schultze-Kraft et al., 2016). That is, a ‘stop’ signal triggered by
a real-time prediction of one’s intended movement is sufficient
to allow inhibition and eliminate that movement, provided it is
delivered at least 200 ms prior to the execution of the event.
Demonstrations like these provide concrete evidence that
our decisions and motivations are accompanied by many
parallel neural mechanisms that occupy a dimension beyond
our conscious, deliberative processes of reasoning. Measuring
the corresponding neural activity provides tangible, proximal
measurements of these processes, but neuroscience is not the only
context in which we are aware of such unconscious influences
on behavior. Freud may have been the first to draw public
attention to the prominent role of subconscious influences on our
otherwise rational behavior (Freud, 1913). More recently, studies
of decision-making in contexts ranging from economics to moral
deliberation have made it clear that our choices are strongly
guided by implicit emotional influences that often deviate from
rational optimization, and the narratives we construct around
our decisions are often architected in a post hoc manner (Haidt,
2001; Lerner et al., 2015). Finally, we are increasingly aware of
the predictable consequences of many remote influences that
we have no individual control over. These include our genetic
makeup (Brunner et al., 1993; Mason and Frick, 1994), early
rearing environments (Kaplow and Widom, 2007; Mulvaney
and Mebert, 2007), and complex social systems (Yoshikawa
et al., 2012; Javanbakht et al., 2015). These factors all bias our
cognition and behavior in predictable ways and their influence
impinges on neural systems that guide our behavior directly,
in ways that are largely inaccessible to our moment-to-moment

agency in our behavior (Nahmias et al., 2005; Nichols, 2011),
it has become increasingly necessary to clarify what aspects of
our thoughts and behavior remain free, to what extent they
are free, and (perhaps most important for our purposes here)
what the relevance of this is for our judgments about how to
intervene to address pragmatic social needs. After all, moral
responsibility is more abstract and partially removed from the
practical considerations of punishment and intervention in our
justice system. As it turns out, laypeople’s judgments about
these topics are not always internally consistent, often reflecting
shifting attitudes when considered in abstract terms vs. concrete
examples. For instance, when considering theoretical arguments,
people are more likely to maintain that determinism undermines
basic moral responsibility; when considering concrete episodic
scenarios, we are more likely to affirm basic accountability for our
actions responsibility (Nichols, 2011).
Using the disease model of addiction as an example,
opponents do not deny the evidence of biological changes in
motivational systems that account for changes in behavior.
However, opponents still cling to the relevance of individual
agency, free will, and decision making, ostensibly apart from
their biological influences, perhaps only because this reaffirms
our most basic intuitions about choice, consequences, and
our ability to change (Feldman et al., 2014). This veneration
of free will over the biological systems that govern choice
may have counterproductive consequences, however. The best
methods for intervention arguably improve by understanding
the biological systems governing our choices and motivated
behavior, particularly in the context of maladaptive behaviors
involving substances that impinge directly on these systems. It
is the context of intervention that becomes highly relevant for
our consideration of the ongoing role of neuroscience in the
future of jurisprudence. The influence of neuroscience on these
concerns is already evident in a number of contexts discussed
in the next section, and it has the potential to continue to
improve our practical management of an imperfect but adaptable
criminal justice system.

these disorders has altered how we address these issues both
clinically and interpersonally.
The current accepted model of addiction promoted by
the National Institutes of Health is that of a brain disorder
instantiated in motivational and inhibitory systems, brought on
by exposure to substances that pharmacologically impose lasting
physiological changes on these systems (NIDA, 2019). Like
other diseases, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental exposures,
and variability in physiology all promote individual differences
in susceptibility to addiction. Unlike many other diseases, the
observable symptoms are almost entirely behavioral. Moreover,
these behaviors are often categorically illegal and punishable
by law (in the case of illicit drug use), but may also be
viewed under a moral lens as a transgression against more
virtuous decision making. What makes this acutely relevant to
discussions of neurolaw is the nature of arguments for and
against the disease model of addiction, and how they reflect
philosophical discourse on free will, neuro-determinism, and
culpability. Opposition to the disease model can be easily found
in publications such as Heyman’s Addiction: A Disorder of Choice
(Heyman, 2009), Schaler’s Addiction is a Choice (Schaler, 2000),
and Satel and Lilienfeld’s Addiction and the Brain-Disease Fallacy
(Satel and Lilienfeld, 2014). These arguments make rhetorical
appeals to the primary role of choice, agency, volition, and selfcontrol. In doing so, they tacitly place limits on reductionist
approaches that examine supportive physiological processes
that govern our choices. These arguments seem rooted in the
fundamental conservation of free will as something irreducible,
and impervious to reductionist, deterministic paradigms.
By contrast, neuroscientific research nested in the disease
model of addiction studies elements of motivated behavior
in simpler parts, examining individual variability across these
dimensions. For example, this research examines shifts in
valuation (e.g., the motivational weight of pharmacological
reinforcers over natural reinforcers) along with the weakening
of inhibitory control (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002). These
approaches also examine transitions between behavior governed
primarily by executive control systems and behavior carried out
by networks governing compulsive, automatic actions (Kalivas
and O’Brien, 2008). As such, the “disease” aspect of addiction
is more fundamentally rooted in the physiological systems
that govern our choices and behaviors, rather than in the
complex behavioral symptom of drug-taking per se. Adopting
this perspective requires a reductionist and determinist paradigm
for informing our free will. While not universally accepted (and
perhaps still requiring semantic refinement), the progressive
contributions of the disease model of addiction include a better
understanding of biological influences that culminate in our
motivated behavior. Progress on this front further serves to dilute
a predominantly moralistic attitude toward addiction that may
motivate primarily punitive actions intended to address a very
legitimate societal problem. This contribution will feature heavily
in our ongoing assessment of the relevance of neuroscience in an
evolving criminal justice system.
These arguments are familiar in the context of debates about
the nature of free will and responsibility. While our intuitions
may still demand the preservation of a concept like free will and

OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS EVOLVING, NOT
STATIC
The relevance neuroscience has in our current justice system
is already firmly established in several contexts outlined in
Section “Neuroscience Has Firmly Established Its Place in
Jurisprudence.” The way neuroscience is promoting progressive
changes in our justice system is also evident in a number of
ways we address here. We can use recent examples of these
changes to help anticipate the ongoing evolution of jurisprudence
as informed by advancing neuroscience. Importantly, we reiterate
our position that the influence of neuroscience has relatively
less to do with any perceived exculpatory extensions of a
purely deterministic universe (my brain made me do it), and
is more practically relevant for the way we interpret concepts
like “justice” and the role of the justice system in promoting
a safe, functioning society. Shifting normative attitudes on
this front influence how we choose to intervene and hold

there remains a great deal of room for improving strategies
aimed at protecting and benefiting society on a large scale.
These changes in normative attitudes are evident in the evolving
standards we use in legal sentencing and the ways we continue to
evaluate the relative efficacy of various punitive strategies.
As noted, the criminal justice system in the United States
serves many functions beyond a punitive one. We rely on it to
deter flagrant abuses of the law, to protect society at large from the
most dangerous individuals, and (ostensibly) to help intervene
and rehabilitate those who violate the expectations of their social
systems. The current implementation of this system, however,
has been heavily biased toward retributivist deterrence strategies,
which have demonstrated their own limitations over several
decades (Frost, 2006). Indeed, they have contributed, in part, to
the highest incarceration rates, per capita, in the entire world.
Public attitudes play an overt role in this as the Supreme Court
has endorsed that public desire for retribution is a legitimate basis
for establishing harsh, punitive judgments up to and including
capital punishment (Gregg v. Georgia, 19765 ).
Initial steps in adopting more effective strategies may be
fostered by increasing numbers of people reconsidering the
implicit relevance and meaning of concepts like free will for
achieving societies’ goals. As the meaning of this concept evolves
and our understanding of behavior integrates more deterministic
features, we are less compelled to frame maladaptive, antisocial
actions within paradigms that embrace elusive immaterial origins
(like evil, for instance) (Grasmick et al., 1992; Unnever et al.,
2005). Rather, we are better equipped to recognize the influence
of pathology, environment, and acquired maladaptive cognitive
strategies in promoting antisocial behavior, where the levers
of justice have considerably more remedial influence. After all,
pathology is a more tractable problem than is evil. Responding
to antisocial behavior, then, becomes a more pragmatic issue,
and more progressive strategies aimed at addressing objective
moderators of such behavior can be readily explored. In this way,
even slow shifts in normative judgments are highly relevant to the
way we assess culpability as a society, and the degree to which we
view punitive measures as achieving their intended purpose as a
remedy against undesired, antisocial behavior.
Neuroscience ultimately provides a useful platform for
advocating new strategies of social management, where old
strategies have perhaps proven ineffective or inefficient. New
strategies may be less oriented toward retribution, per se, and
more driven by practical concerns serving society with more
efficient and productive solutions. Such strategies may, for
instance, be aimed at better serving the mental health and social
needs of those who come in contact with the justice system,
reducing long-term incarceration rates for low risk offenders,
and reducing recidivism by improving rehabilitative and
reintegration efforts. In the worst scenarios, where rehabilitative
interventions may not be a realistic goal, neuroscience also
provides a platform for improving our predictions of future
dangerousness (Aharoni et al., 2013; Steele et al., 2015; Kiehl
et al., 2018). Such strategies may be integrated for making better
decisions about those who need to be removed from society

people accountable for their actions. Neuroscience, after all,
has improved our general understanding of motivated human
behavior and myriad deterministic influences that converge
to promote maladaptive, antisocial behavior. Where there is
improved understanding of these influences, we will be better
equipped to introduce improved strategies at remedying systemic
problems contributing to the behaviors and societal problems we
aim to diminish.
Conservative appeals to traditional applications of
jurisprudence regularly make the claim that neuroscience
need not change anything about the way we interpret legal
responsibility. This is true in one sense: if our only motivation is
preservation of the status quo. In an article previously published
in this series, Criminal Responsibility and Neuroscience: No
Revolution Yet, Bigenwald and Chambon (Chambon and
Bigenwald, 2019) establish that no revolution is necessary for
us to continue applying the same normative framework of
responsibility that the legal system has always operated on.
Several arguments are presented emphasizing the primacy of
our intuitions about agency for assigning criminal responsibility.
That is, even the reality of a purely deterministic universe does
not negate criminal responsibility, which in their view, exists
as a mostly pragmatic concept independent of free will. This is
true only in that our legal system certainly employs a number
of arbitrary rules in order to remain serviceable. It is no great
leap in understanding to suggest that it simply operates ‘as if ’
we are responsible agents. Our objection on this matter is that
this reality will become increasingly dissatisfying, even from a
normative perspective, as general knowledge increases, providing
more insight into the boundaries and limitations of our own
agency. Fortunately, the present series of articles is under no
obligation to preserve the status quo; but rather, it challenges us
to describe how the legal system might be practically changed
by discoveries in neuroscience. We therefore submit that these
changes may be less visible in the ways we interpret and enforce
the law, and more visible in the ways we punish violators of
our laws and adapt as a society to preserve (or advance) our
most pressing goals.
As Bigenwald and Chambon point out, responsibility has many
possible meanings. A tree can certainly be responsible for falling
on a wire and causing a power failure, even though it has no
real agency. Calling a tree responsible for these consequences
doesn’t violate any of our intuitions about agency and its value.
Calling a tree “guilty” for this, however, feels odd (violates our
intuitions), just as wishing to implement retributive harm on
the tree would seem senseless. This illustration emphasizes a
division between practical considerations of responsibility and
the attribution of a kind of value judgment about the tree’s
actions, and how they align with normative moral values. Even
as we are keenly interested in (also) preventing other trees from
falling (deterrence), one of the key roles of our justice system
remains a punitive one, and this features heavily in how harshly
we decide to punish. Our intuitions about agency, free will,
and moral judgment play a much larger role in our instinct
to punish the guilty. Where neuroscience may play its most
significant role is in the space between legal determinations
and implementing corrective measures that benefit society. Here

behavior and less capable of the highest order decision-making
we ordinarily attribute to adults. That is, opinions informed
by progress in neuroscience suggesting a limited capacity for
behavioral control are influential for evaluating an individual’s
culpability (i.e., how harsh a punishment is justified). Implicit
in the developmental perspective applied is an acknowledgment
of the capacity for ongoing change. MRI evidence was also
presented (in amicus brief) for consideration in Graham v.
Florida (2011)9 . which determined it unconstitutional to sentence
juveniles to life without parole for crimes not involving homicide.
These decisions can be fully reconciled with normative
attitudes about responsibility and determinism. Despite being
fully responsible for their behavior, biological limitations on
individuals’ executive functioning and inherent capacity for
change play a prominent role in our consideration of how harsh
their punishments ought to be. The Court’s decision in Roper
v. Simmons affirmed that juveniles have less culpability due to
their immature development, making them less deserving of
the harshest punishments. These decisions do not imply that,
as a society, we are any less interested in protecting ourselves
from dangerous people or ensuring the safety of free citizens.
What is confirmed in these decisions is a relative diminution in
our motivation to levy harsh retributivist judgments in contexts
where we recognize deterministic limitations in individual
culpability. This, of course, opens the door to consider how
we judge those with other biological limitations in cognitive
functioning, or those disadvantaged in other ways.

permanently. Before addressing this further, it will be important
to consider a few examples for how advancing science has already
changed the way we think about culpability and make decisions
about interventions and punishment as a society.

Limits on Capital Punishment
Torture and execution have been legally sanctioned forms
of punishment since at least the 18th century BCE, as it is
indicated in the Code of Hammurabi (c.1750 BCE) for such
crimes as burglary, adultery, making false accusations, and
poor construction of a house (Harper, 1904). Even within the
history of the United States, the use of capital punishment
has changed considerably, formerly implemented in cases of
burglary, counterfeiting, and treason among others (Randa,
1997). Beginning with the adoption of bans on cruel and
unusual punishment6 ., modern societies (including the U.S.)
have gradually changed their views on behavior deserving
the harshest penalties, limiting its application for the most
egregious crimes and even further to individuals most deserving
of harsh punishment. Determining who deserves the harshest
punishments has a great deal to do with our perceptions of their
intentions, malice, and reasonable expectations of self-control.
As we will see, these judgments also incorporate the relative
utility of the punishment for fulfilling an intended punitive
role. The relevance of neuroscience in drawing conclusions
about these issues increases as their evaluation increasingly
incorporate reductionist, determinist, biological perspectives of
motivated behavior.
Prominent examples of this have come in the form of supreme
court decisions accompanying restricted applications of the death
penalty. For instance, Atkins v. Virginia7 . ruled to prevent the
execution of those with severe intellectual disabilities, citing
“evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a
mature society.” In cases like these, these evolving standards refer
more specifically to what the court witnesses as a consensus
among other jurisdictions and the way they have tended to
interpret and enforce the law in recent history. Many states,
for instance, had previously outlawed the execution of those
with severe intellectual disabilities prior to these proceedings.
Among the topics discussed in the formal ruling is the sentiment
that those with reduced intellectual capacity have limitations
in their adaptive functioning, reasoning, communication, and
understanding of events around them and the actions of others.
Thus, leveraging the most severe of punishments fails to align
with the practical concerns of retribution and deterrence.
Similarly, Roper v. Simmons (2005)8 . abolished capital
punishment of juveniles citing similar “evolving standards” and
an emerging consensus among other jurisdictions. In this case,
however, the decision was also influenced in part by neuroscience
research (including fMRI evidence) presented in an amicus
brief by the American Psychological Association, suggesting that
psychological deficits germane to adolescence (developmental
limitations) make young people more prone to impulsive

The Insanity Defense
Our collective understanding of culpability has almost always
included provisions for certain disadvantages. A clear illustration
of this endures in the limitations on culpability levied against
those with serious mental disorders. This has been a common
feature of many ancient legal systems and customs, including
elements of Roman law which were carried forward in preNorman England (Walker, 1985). For instance, it was at times
customary for juries to find insane criminals guilty, but refer
them to the king for subsequent pardoning. More contemporary
applications of these provisions give juries specific guidelines
for applying these judgments directly. The M’Naghten Rule, for
instance, formalized a set of conditions in English law that could
be applied more consistently following a controversial acquittal.
In 1843, Daniel M’Naghten suffered paranoid delusions and
murdered a civil servant, mistaking him for the English Prime
Minister. He was acquitted for murder based on substantial
evidence that he was mentally ill, and he was forcibly committed
to an asylum, where he spent the rest of his life. Despite
the very real limits placed on his freedom, the ensuing public
dissent following a not-guilty verdict (and official condemnation
of the verdict by the queen) compelled establishing a set of
explicit requirements for instantiating criminal insanity. These
guidelines, in some adapted form, are still prevalent in many
jurisdictions across the world today. They essentially require
(for an insanity defense) that a defendant be so mentally

life. The public outcry following his alarmingly lenient sentence
was instrumental in abolishing the “diminished capacity” defense
in California. The relevance of this trial for our present
arguments is not so much to draw attention to the trial
and defense, but rather what happened afterward. Following
a defense which hinged on severe depression, White served a
relatively lenient sentence at Soledad State Prison in California
(not a secure hospital, or institute known for therapeutic
intervention). Two years after his release from prison, Dan White
committed suicide.
These events raise many interesting questions from a
legal, psychological, and philosophical perspective. Did White
ultimately get what he deserved? Did those seeking harsher
retributive action find some gratification in his suicide, or is it
inherently less satisfying that White’s death was not carried out in
a punitive context? Was White’s case a greater failure in the basic
judicial process of determining culpability, or more of a failure
in enforcing effective interventions following a determination of
his mental illness? Those like White, committing serious offenses
(e.g., homicide) in the throes of mental illness, are typically
forcibly committed to secure institutions with some focused
psychiatric capacity, and do not generally go free in such a short
time. From a utilitarian perspective, this form of intervention
seems reasonable. It serves the role of protecting society from
dangerous people and arguably remains a visible deterrent,
while coupling offenders’ containment with therapeutic and/or
rehabilitative attention. Where this strategy fails is perhaps only
limited in satisfying an instinctual urge to serve harsh retributive
actions against those that have harmed us personally and/or
violated our most sacred moral values (Grasmick et al., 1992;
Unnever et al., 2005).
It matters that this trial has largely been enshrined as a
miscarriage of justice, but probably for many of the wrong
reasons (as evinced by history’s retelling of the “Twinkie
Defense”). In some ways eradication of the diminished capacity
defense serves as a scapegoat that only distracts us from more
fundamental issues in our society and our justice system that
are slow to change. Essentially, we still struggle to balance our
shifting attitudes of culpability against a stubborn instinct to
enact harsh retributive penalties in cases of egregious tragedy.
After all, various provisions for mental illness in sentencing
still exist in virtually all jurisdictions. Despite fine tuning the
language of these rules, we (as a society) have steadfastly
acknowledged that criminal actions occurring due to factors
outside the ordinary limits of one’s control deserve more leniency
or a categorically different form of intervention than simple
retribution. In order to see the potential benefit of progressive
changes in jurisprudence, however, our corrections systems and
forensic psychiatric facilities need to be equipped with the
tools to enact these changes in ways that demonstrate more
satisfying results.

impaired as to not know what they are doing and/or not know
right from wrong.
Following in step with the very impetus for M’Naghten,
many subsequent adaptations and amendments to these rules
have been applied, usually following controversial rulings. As
a result, several variations and alternative defenses have been
enacted in state and federal jurisdictions. These either amend the
essential language of M’Naghten used to describe what constitutes
insanity, or they shift the burden of proof in important ways.
For instance, in Parsons v. State of Alabama (1887)10 ., an
appeal was made following the controversial conviction of
Nancy Parsons who killed her husband under the delusion
that he had cast an evil spell on her. The court established a
provision for instances in which a defendant may be deemed
insane, despite knowing right from wrong. The ruling described
instances where a disease has “destroyed the defendant’s free
will” and became known as the Irresistible Impulse defense.
Other important developments have included modifications
that specifically exclude antisocial personality disorder from an
exculpatory mental illness, since its symptoms are primarily
manifest through repeated criminal conduct (American Law
Institute Model Penal Code, 1962)11 . There has also been a
formal shift of responsibility from the prosecution – proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was sane – to the
defense, which must prove (by preponderance of evidence) that
the defendant was insane (Insanity Defense Reform Act; IDRA,
1984)12 . A lengthy, stand-alone review would be necessary to
adequately review the many important modifications that have
been made to these rules over time and across many jurisdictions;
however, an overarching pattern is apparent in this complex
history. Through many shifts of language and interpretations,
we continually re-affirm the preservation of limitations on
culpability for those impaired by mental illness. We also betray
the cognitive dissonance this instills against the backdrop of
our most basic retributive motivations, and our sensitivities to
potential abuses of these provisions.
As noted above, many of these changes come on the heels
of controversial, high-profile cases. Consider for instance the
trial of Dan White for the murder of San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk. Despite
substantial evidence of premeditation and malice in the killings,
White was ultimately convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather
than first-degree murder, and served only 5 years in prison.
This outcome was aided by what is still disparagingly referred
to as “The Twinkie Defense.” To this day, popular retellings
of this case often reinforce a narrative that White’s defense
asserted his behavior was the result of eating sugary snacks,
including Twinkies. In reality, psychiatrists testified that White
suffered from major depression and had diminished capacity for
controlling his behavior due to this pathology. An incidental
detail of his diminished capacity included recent poor dietary
habits, despite having been extremely health conscious all his

instance progressive treatment programs being instituted at the
Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center among high-risk young
offenders (Caldwell and Van Rybroek, 2005; Caldwell et al.,
2006a). Analyses have indicated better outcomes and relatively
less economic burden on society by enacting these aggressive
treatment strategies (Caldwell et al., 2006b). To be sure, there will
always be those who are resistant to our best available treatments
at any given time, and unable to return safely to free society.
However, this further reinforces the value of pursuing new
and better strategies informed by ongoing research addressing
the origins, development, and maintenance of maladaptive,
antisocial behavior.
In assessing how neuroscience may continue to inform judicial
decision-making in the future, many possibilities arise. Could
brain scans that objectively quantify one’s neurodevelopment
or functional capacity eventually be used to determine whether
one is tried as an adult or juvenile? Could predictive models
determine whether one is amenable to therapeutic attention or
is likely to remain resistant to available rehabilitative efforts?
Could neuroscientific measures reveal specific risk factors for
re-offending that are not evident on standard psychiatric
assessments? These are difficult questions indeed, and ones that
we do not yet have answers for. We simply argue that to ignore
them or to undermine their potential value only to reinforce the
status quo seems myopic and overtly servile toward an imperfect
system. As neuroscience ushers in a more complete bio-psychosocial understanding of maladaptive behavior, and as ongoing
incarceration strategies become unsustainable, our prediction is
that we will be forced to consider alternative approaches that
serve public interest in more pragmatic ways. This will involve
wider application of therapeutic, rehabilitative approaches and
more aggressive therapeutic and reintegration strategies that
reduce the likelihood for recidivism. Such applications may be
particularly effective among young offenders (Glenn, 2019). This
may also include better risk assessment in making decisions about
sentencing and parole. Major advances on these fronts may only
require us to first suspend our most basic retributivist instincts
when addressing social problems, and remain open minded
about the potential for more prudent strategies. Neuroscience
doesn’t fill these roles on its own, but it provides a platform for
advancing each of these goals through empirical research and
improved knowledge.

evolving standards ushered in by a more refined understanding
of human behavior and the boundaries of our own agency.
Neuroscience, surely, does not make this progress simpler.
On the contrary, as our understanding of biology’s role in
promoting pathology and maladaptive behavior increases, this
encourages a far more nuanced interpretation of culpability
in the face of various advantages and disadvantages. Shifting
attitudes on this front have fostered an expansion of contexts
that we harbor special provisions for in the law. However,
rather than promoting overly exculpatory attitudes (a kind
of straw man common in arguments diminishing the role of
neuroscience in law), these shifts have largely required changes
only in the way we intervene and balance corrective and/or
punitive measures in such contexts. We suggest it is reasonable
to expect these trends to continue as retributive goals are
softened and we aim to integrate more practical solutions for
addressing criminogenic needs, improving reintegration, and
reducing recidivism.
Using offender age as a model for such a transition, the
criminal justice system has recently made provisions to limit
harsh sentencing (capital punishment/life in prison) of juvenile
offenders in most circumstances, but various jurisdictions still
apply somewhat arbitrary rules about the cut-offs for these
provisions. Certainly young offenders are not all equal from a
neurodevelopmental perspective. So does it make sense to apply
a bright line rule allowing capital punishment on someone’s 18th
birthday? Neuroscience may continue to inform this perspective,
expanding a more nuanced evaluation. Recent research, in
fact, has demonstrated that a brain-derived measure of gray
matter related to age is a better predictor of future antisocial
behavior than is chronological age (Kiehl et al., 2018). As
such, it may be a more pertinent question to consider the
relative advantages in development and mental health with
which one is equipped before deciding whether they deserve our
harshest punishments. Trends in this direction are encouraged
by the bifurcation of guilt and sentencing phases of some
criminal trials. Another perspective to consider is what effort
and resources are justified in the aim of preserving and enacting
capital punishment as an extreme punitive measure for rare
circumstances. Studies on the deterrence effects of the death
penalty are equivocal at best (Weisberg, 2005), and economic
scrutiny suggests that we may be incapable of enacting the
death penalty in any reasonably efficient manner such that it
serves its intended purposes (Aviram and Newby, 2013). Despite
our enduring retributivist instincts, we may eventually decide
that abolition of the death penalty represents a more practical
solution, obviating some of our more difficult choices when
it comes to punishment. But capital punishment is not the
only context within which shifting attitudes may promote more
pragmatic strategies.
In the case of less severe sentences, we (as a society) have
demonstrated more amenability to the potential value of remedial
approaches and possible re-integration of young offenders.
Certainly, more aggressive treatment strategies integrating
contemporary cognitive-behavioral approaches for improving
long-range outcomes have proven both successful and costeffective (Caldwell and Van Rybroek, 2013). Consider for

Abstract
The development of sociotechnical codes by the legal system acts as a marker of
good citizens and development of self where social norms matter. In most cases,
despite cultural differences, socialization plays an important role in making sense
of law. The question is, ‘how does law come to mind and what is the role of brain?
This question will be dealt keeping the debate on brain determinism and free will
critically at the forefront.
Keywords Legal Socialization · Identity · Neuroscience · Power · Self

Our whole gamut of existence in society are interconnected and any attempt to
bifurcate these psychological aspects are on the verge of a reductive and incomplete
understanding of our existence. In one of the decisions by Indian court under the
juvenile justice act, the person passing the maturity test does not get blanket cover
from criminal process1. Since the agenda of reformation is paramount in juvenile
justice, the general idea is in the common sense that the person has not attended that
maturity as compared to normal adult population. What if the maturity test gives contrary signals, that though the person is not adult but has full capacity to discriminate
between moral and immoral act, right and wrong, criminal, and non-criminal acts?
This question addresses how the severity of crime becomes one of the factors to
relook into the available laws of reformations. The reformation is needed to address

the severity of crime as a matter of deterrence, however, the rising debates coming
from the developmental psychology and neuroscience also require critical attention.
Since law is a social technique to bind people, make them live together, introduce
order, and deliver justice (Kelsen, 1941a, b). When people’s everyday actions are
systematically moderated by the law, humans go beyond their individual biologism.
There are working patterns, habits, emotions, and routines are constructed as per the
social norms (see Tyler, 2021). It became an act of making sense as per the social
circumstances. In the case of juvenile justice law and construction of maturity in the
Indian society, biological metaphors derived from neuroscience, such as, ‘brain maturation’, ‘cortical maturity’ or ‘synaptic pruning’ is also understood within the social
ambit. Justice is a value loaded term and need to be continuously defined as per the
culture, society, Zietgist and situation (Fox, 1997). For example, in India when right
conservatives formed government, their method of imparting justice is constructed
as per the perspective of powerful (e.g., capitalists, elites and male conservatives)
and so the researches meant to be fulfilling these political needs systematically capturing both social sciences and biological science. It is myth that biological science
is neutral and social sciences is political. Both are political and so the neuroscience
(Pykett, 2015). The objective of this paper is to engage in an interdisciplinary discussion about how we make sense of law and our brain as an organ of determining our
social reality has a narrowed approach if not collaborate with the critical humanities
and social sciences.
However, the emergence of modern research in DNA and neuroscience indicates
determinism of the person’s action. Studies indicated that neuroscientific knowledge
can also create an exaggerated understanding of human intention, action, and responsibility. Judges may get easily influenced by the fMRI images which may affect their
decision inclined in favour of the defendant or plaintiff despite the available precedents (see Jones, Buckholtz, Schall, & Marois, 2014). Socialization with the law
involves the development of a critical sense of various socio-cultural events. For
example, how Juvenile law in India treats adolescents and sociocognitive development needs to be debated without discounting neurological development (e.g., Luna
et al., 2013). Studies also showed that biology depends upon the developmental process and it is one of the important factors in the acquiring of reasoning skills, emotional regulation, self-control, and perspective-taking (e.g., Tyler & Trinkner, 2017;
Grusec & Hasting, 2015) and law’s recognition of age and criminal responsibilities
also depends upon the cultural context (e.g., Mercurio et al., 2020).
Making sense of law in this paper is understood with the established research
on legal socialization (e.g., Justice & Meares, 2021; Tapp & Levine, 1974; Tyler
& Trinkner, 2017), social cognition (Lane et al., 2007) and brain executive function to control and monitor one’s intention and behaviour (e.g., Fernyhough 2010;
Luria 1980a, b). Legal socialization is one of the interdisciplinary lines of research
in law and social psychology, though, it has not yet accounted for the role of the rise
of neuroscience in both domains. Since brain studies are done in laboratories, their
influence over different disciplines is immense in the future. Legal socialization is
the continuous process where all the stakeholders from children to adults make sense
of law as per their interaction with alters such as parents, teachers, media, peers,
government agents, and police whose powerful presence in the person’s sociocultural

13

249

activities keep on reminding what is legal. Legal is also what is ethically and socially
upright in sociocultural terms, which manifests in the person’s will to choose the
action. According to Han et al. (2013a, b), the current movements in cultural neurosciences showed how the culture is complex and dynamic social environment where
human brain is shaped. They emphasized the sociocultural nature of the human brain
influenced by “cultural values, beliefs, and practices shared by a social group” (p.
340).
In one of his reflective works, Damasio (2010) stated that cultures have evolved
justice that takes a common-sense approach to the complexities of decision making
and aims at protecting societies from those who violate established laws. There he
showed how the role of brain science is near negligible. However, the role of brain
science is remarkable and creates the possibility of systematic avoidance and undermining of legal concepts. The mundane reality is what we live by and to be conscious
of it and attempting to resist those acts is a crux to bringing the sober connection
between the law and society without losing our ability to be critically conscious. To
understand others, we may follow various routes, like a formless critique not pointing
towards anything particular or being in a shape to offer a visible critique of the situation. Since these aspects of our lives are very much in our memories and experience,
people, may act as naïve scientists (Heider, 1958), look for the proximal causes and
avoid the uncertainty of being reflective or like social psychologists or other social
scientists, give an explanation to the possible causal links.
The knowledge of law or being mindful of law is not as systematic as our society
portrays it in a taken for granted way. The consciousness of law is being conscious
of social structure or as Marx (1984/1867) noted “it is not the consciousness of people that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their
consciousness” (p. 20). People are conscious of themselves in the social world. For
example, in most simplistic and minimal situations when a person intends something
towards any person or thing, this whole approach is a social conduit of one’s selfpositioning in the social environment. The idea of self as one and pure is a myth and
denies the logical connection of sociality which defines the self and even negates it.
The self and consciousness are not dependent on just one kind of self-reference effect
(SRE), which was a dominant paradigm to understand the role of self in memory, but
flourish in a variety of contexts, making the self a multifaceted entity not difficult to
be precisely defined (see Klein, 2012). Society attains its fabric through the objective
and subjective view of the social objects, which Vygotsky (1978) indicated as a form
of engagement with the tools in a sociocultural context, where the objectivity of the
external environment defines the subjectivity of the person. Law in its most pragmatic form is operational rather than symbolic and the very engagement of law with
the people preserves the fabric of society. The sociocultural tools through which the
society is understood with the active check by law seem to be dominantly regulated
by the scientific view of the people (e.g., machine, organism, entity, unit, datum, sapiens) with the capacity to intend and think. This connection between law and science
has a limited view of society and the stern boundary of law will not suffice to address
the complex view of society. In one study concerning performance and judgement,
researchers found that women who were in the control condition performed well in
the task and their brain areas such as inferior prefrontal cortex, left inferior parietal

13

cortex and bilateral angular gyrus became active [Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu,
& Tsivkin, 1999). It can be compared to women whose gender or inferior ethnic
identity were activated during math performance didn’t show enhanced activation
in these regions. However, the activation was in ventral anterior cingulate cortex, an
area that has been associated with emotional self-regulation and the processing of
affective information and social feedback (see Moran, Macrae, Heatherton, Wyland,
& Kelley, 2006; Somerville, Heatherton, & Kelley, 2006). Thus, situation and context
matter in performance and judgement. It can be inferred that neuroscience is helpful in the court proceedings and could support law significantly in interpreting the
‘culturally modulated social behaviours’ (Salvato et al., 2014, p. 2). Further, research
showed how our preferences may be distinct but can have similar neural pathways. It
is the cultural systems that gives accuracy in mind reading (see Adams et al., 2010;
Chiao et al., 2008) showing that our brains are malleable which absorbs the regularities in our cultural environment2. Usually, the legal domain seems to be driven by
this maturation-cognitive development account which is quite prevalent in the public
view of cognition. However, the Vygotskian view seems to be collinear with the
Bruner (1986) and G. H Mead (1934) view at the meta-theoretical level in which the
child discovers in the context and forms the consciousness of the ‘generalized other’
such as rational understanding of group activity which helps the child in developing
autonomy and capacity to participate in the society (see also Mead & da Silva, 2011
for detail on Mead) respectively. It is established knowledge that the brain develops with the maturation and growth that leads to the child’s intellectual capacity,
problem-solving and relationships understanding. Is the brain development sin qua
non for the development of perceptual and other cognitive and social activities? If the
answer is affirmative, then it is important to understand the meaning of growth and
embodied understanding of self. The understanding that the culture and context under
which the consciousness of meaningful collective self develops has the potential to
form transformative neuroscience (see also Chaudhary et al., 2022).
The notion of an objective view of society shows a good interdisciplinary connection between law and science. In the words of Jovanovic (2010) “critical science has
to re-establish the relation to society as a whole in its historical dimension, not just
the relation to scientific communities” (p. 580). The problem with critical science is
its lack of foundation as it is not laden in the defined categories like the mainstream
sciences and law. The defined categories make the established features of these categories more pronounced and easier to bring into the vocabulary of people engaged
with various institutions. This engagement with established categories by the law and
science is their inability to bring the invisible and subaltern identities into the mainstream discursive picture of society. The methods which make these undefined social
categories readily come to the mind are taken as irrelevant, unstructured, and useless.
Some of the methods which in most cases use dialogical and participant perspectives
have much to survive from the threat of status quo, science, and law.

The Emergence of Legal Self
People get socialized with law and their brain gets adapted to the circumstances.
Law has the power to shape the thinking, behaviour, and emotion of the masses.
According to Kagan (2007) “Law’s power does not stem from tradition or its formal
pedigree alone, but also from its persuasiveness as good public policy” (p. xxiv). He
pointed toward the responsive law where various institutions embody the legal values
and hence are legal institutions. Our brain shows the picture of continuity at all the
levels of consciousness, sub-consciousness, and unconsciousness. The nerve cells are
active despite the persons’ knowledge. It is a paradox because we think in a categorical way rather than in terms of continuity. The need is to clarify this point that it is in
the social language to explain something in terms of categorical benchmark, otherwise, the continuity of brain and mind are always at their pace, what Whitehead called
‘fallacy of misplaced concreteness’ and Ryle (1949) called as a ‘category mistake’.
Our observation of people and forming an impression about them and self becomes
more intense as a child grows. Some of the studies noticed that even the child of age
three develops a sense of real and imaginary objects (see Harris, Brown, Mariott,
Whittall & Harmer, 1991; Sussman, 2001; see also Dunlosky & Metcalfe, 2009). If
the law is objectified through the family and other social institutions, it impels the
brain to think categorically about ethical-unethical, moral-immoral, good-bad, and
right-wrong. The children’s capacity to be cognizant of law based on their maturity
is also an understanding of something concrete to abstract. The law is understood by
different people in various ways, where some understand it in terms of following the
orders of elders and some view it in the form of social obligations. In the case of the
former, despite their ability to differentiate between real and imaginary forms, wrong
and right are mostly concretized and associated with the consequences. Extensive
critical work is done in the domain of development, cognition, and activities of the
children, despite the systematic differences in the approaches (see Mattingly, Lutkehaus, & Throop, 2008). For Piaget (1965), it was the development and maturation
which transformed the moral understanding of the child from the stage of “morality
of constraints’ to the ‘morality of cooperation’ as the child’s cognitive development
matures from concrete thinking to abstract thinking. The quality of being cognizant of one’s thoughts about something comes under the category of abstract thinking which according to Piaget is hardly developed in the previous stages. Though
Piaget (1965) differs significantly from other theorists like Vygotsky (1978), at the
perspectival level, where he emphasizes the natural maturation order in the child
as compared to Vygotsky’s view which emphasized the importance of significant
others, such as one’s parent or teacher who are better equipped with experience and
capable to transform the cognitive capacity of the child. Piaget did not show how
some children understand cultural morality better than others at the same age or how
some have a better abstract level of understanding and some still hang back on the
conventionalities (e.g., Kohlberg, 1981; Candee & Kohlberg, 1987). As in the case
of Juveniles, law generally look after the general pattern of development and in rare
case move beyond the conventionalities. There are instances where Juveniles move
beyond their socio-cognitive and biological capacities to accomplish difficult task
involving duty to the nation, creativity and helping behaviour. The general marker of

13

252

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:247–270

maturity and cognition is not always successfully applied to the practical life. This
is what Vygotsky and further Luria indicated that children are not passive but active
agents who make sense of their environment, integrate the result of their experiences,
and masters the cultural tools (see van der Veer & Ijzendoorn, 1985; see also Valsiner
& van der Veer, 2000). It is not always that they do risky, negligent, and reckless acts
in a group but also altruistic and co-construct social innovations. We can see this in
the approach of Vygotsky and Luria (1993) who indicated that higher mental functioning is the consequence of the historical and cultural processes of discontinuities
and continuities with new socio-cultural interactions and activities.

Social Perception of Law
The understanding of the law is also like understanding expectations from one
another in a bonded social system. Researchers in neuroscience indicates towards the
neural systems involved in processing of social information (e.g., Jenkins & Mitchell, 2011). Legal consciousness or awareness of law during some specific social context is also an information processing act. As in the case of juveniles their behaviour
seems to be dependent upon the facilitating or inhibiting context which they judge
and engage with along with their peers. This is a higher mental processing which may
also involves the capacity to think rationally, take proper action or higher judging
capacity to differentiate between ethical and non-ethical acts and its long terms consequences for self and others. Luria (1980a, b) credited Vygotsky that higher mental
functions exist as a result of interaction of differentiated brain structure making their
unique contribution both holistically and specifically. The systematic attempt to see
the place of neuroscience in our understanding of the world offers a unique and scientific view, however, it is undeniable that this view is also conservative and linear. It
gives as a clear mechanism about how we see the world and understand. Paradoxically, the problem of subjectivity and how we understand the world in a social context is not fulfilled by those mini models showing the linear pathways. Since when we
ponder upon how we make sense of something, our intentions are directed, focussed
and systematic in that moment. But this is not an enough to give an interdisciplinary
picture of our sensemaking. The science does not have all the answers and scientists
are aware of that. Providing a mechanism is not a complete science until appropriately explained without falling into circularities. Social scientific debates often helps
in correcting any faulty conjectures formed during the process of phenomenon detection (Haig, 2014). In the legal context, whose understanding itself emerges from the
everyday meaning making and social constructions, it will be reductive and perfunctory to blindly stick to the quick model generating methods. Neither the developed
models nor any intuition will help in meta level understanding of how we know
somethings as institutions, phenomenon, or social process. Social sciences give an
opportunity to see the social world in more rich manner and that too when it comes
to our working with the societal laws and regulations. Somewhat critical in totally
affirming the role of social science as a perfectly valid junction to understand the law,
Daniel Robinson wrote, “the ambitions of the social scientists include the discovery
of reliable statistical laws permitting better -than-chance predictions of complex

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:247–270

253

social phenomenon (p. 238). It is indicative that the metatheory which overpower
social scientific thinking may create blunders if not critically ventured. According to
him, the social scientists’ ‘predictive efficiency’ may become susceptible to human
and social biases. Since our brain is a mechanistic science and as Stephen Morse
warn legal domain that neurons don’t have sense of past-future and neither aspiration,
what comes in our debate is interpretations and meaning making based on cooccurrence of event and neural firings. However, the common activation of brain areas
while understanding any phenomenon will not show anything substantial unless a
meaning making is formed and affirmed through the everyday languages. Whether it
is any domain of science or law, the interpretations are done in a common language
and categorically classified. If Juvenile delinquency behaviour is explained by psychologists, they adopt framework and strategy best suited to surmise their case, and
likewise the neuroscientists or lawyers. The agenda is to draw a line between the
discipline specific debate and the interdisciplinary debates. In the common and general dialogues, it is done through the folk psychological notions. This forms the
anchored view of some systems of knowledge. Luria (1980a, b) indicated how folk
psychological aspects of intersubjective meaning making explains complexity of
human consciousness. He emphasized going beyond the mechanism and organismic
determinism, by taking note of indepthness of the social contexts and situations. This
cultural-historical note in the Vygotsky-Luria tradition of understanding human
responsibility to the self and the contexts bridges the organismic aspects of neuroscientific mechanism with the sociocultural processes. This anti-modular view denotes
the sociocultural position playing an important role in our brain’s executive function.
The model penal code ascribing the responsibility of any criminal act on the person
looks for certain criteria such as acting voluntarily causing harm with the requisite
mental state. The person committing the act had enough knowledge and sense of
reasoning about the consequences. It was in the persons intention to harm or the person despite having enough cues to refrain from the risky act was reckless and negligent. The behaviour of the person matters most since it is the only observable and
witnessed form of act. What happened in the brain depends upon the persons encountering certain situation or socio-emotional cues which at certain level responds automatically. However, the brain becomes dangerous because of its uncontrollability,
lack of proper self-control mechanism, inappropriate cultural interventions, lack of
mediators and experiences of filtering out thoughts, intentions and behaviour which
are harmful to self and society. Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983) indicated
towards readiness potential (RP)-the specific electrical charge) in the prefrontal cortex before the conscious intention (350–400 ms after the RP) whether to take any
action or avoid. According to Schleim (2012), ‘If every action is caused by unconscious process (e.g., readiness potential) without any chance of control this would
undermine our common understanding of being rational agents” (p. 106). The decision to choose as intended in the prefrontal cortex was contested by some as these are
the areas known for controlled decision making. According to Libets work, it seems
that brain areas operate without our being conscious of it. Conversely, it may be positioned according to the deterministic studies that unconscious is not in our control
which imply that we are not rationale. Since for any being to be logical and reasoning, one must be conscious. Schleim (2012) noticed that research also showed that

13

254

with the help of neurogenetics and neuroimaging evidences the tendency or propensity towards destructive emotions can be identified. But that does not make any one
criminal nor derides one’s self control and sense of responsibility towards the society.
Certain brain areas which are responsible in greater activation of persons tendency to
act in a certain way is generally applied on most of the people. The uniqueness of any
individual who had acted aggressively and committed crime depends upon the context exposed to the person and this is based on few data which cannot be generalized
on larger population. Thus, with some instances of criminal activity and brain recordings of the person one can say that certain area of the brain has propensity to respond
in a non-approving way but that model can be a misfit to general population and not
very reliable. However, as per Luria, this is not the same, since human being are
conscious agents when it comes higher mental functions. Though brain localization
can be identified through different methods, higher mental process is an integral
activity of different zones of elementary brain functional system. So, the determinism
of brain’s functioning was observed by the Luria’s emphasis on the executive functions, thus, situating the context of free will into one’s rationality and unified functioning of the brain. This is one of the important aspects of human social mind which
has the potentiality to offer control to one’s action and brain plays a very important
integrative role. Thus, the legal domain emphasis on the free will is supported in the
general circumstances where there are no past records of strokes or any brain injury
and chromosomal defect, may take forwards the law and neuroscience
interdisciplinarity.
The judges’ understanding of the neurological concepts are not facts in themselves
but a form of interpretations laden in the sociocultural context. The mereological
fallacy (see Bennett & Hacker, 2003) to ascribe intention to a particular neuronal
activity, had occupied the modern neuroscientific research, unless the intervention
of interdisciplinary approaches from different fields of social science. The conscious
intention and will is a illusion or reality seems to be still at the stage of continuous
debate and its presence in the legal domain is till the point the legitimate meaning of
free will is not disturbed. The direct property of brain cells as equated to the psychological functioning and stimulating our behaviour was rejected by Luria. He advocated “that meaningful or language-related activity organizes cerebral processing”
(See Harré & Gillett, 1994, p. 84). The description of the brain and what its localized
part do is legitimate till it contributes to the understanding of the human brain but
seems to be unlawful if its structure and functions are regulated.
Here the assigned and adopted roles, values, and beliefs are sanctioned in a moral
framework and communicated back through various legitimized institutions like rule
of law. Our brain is a self-organizing system and plays an adaptive role rather than
a commanding role. The act of the person which is sanctioned as valid and normal
as per the deep-seated societal experiences makes the brain systematically adapted
for its future triggering. Law in this case is a human thing and is not regulated by
purely scientific explanations as it does happen to the physical phenomenon. Even
the physical phenomenon is a matter of ordering out of the mystery to give a scientific
explanation in a limited way. Human action and thought are as easy to understand stereotypically and popularly as it is difficult to understand others scientifically. The rise
of neuroscience as a discipline and brain as one of the prominent elements of today’s

13

255

popular science is a result of modernity and individualism. The charm of modernity,
new era, individual freedom and will and technological sophistication gave an extra
flash of light to the brain, if not in terms of final understanding, then in the creation
of a picture of systematic mapping which anyway portrays an idea of authenticity or
as Adorno (1973) and Baudrillard (1968) portrayed as creating jargon of authenticity
and as a legitimized systems of the object respectively. Postmodernists were more
into the un-structuring and the dangerous portrayal of words rather than in any kind
of systematic and true knowledge as law preferred and scientific disciplines like neurosciences provided. Though both modernity and postmodernity worked simultaneously, modernity was more pro-system in comparison to postmodernity which never
believed in anything like a system. Since the law is a matter of systematic sanctioning
of rules, texts, legal discourse, and active categorization of ideography of individuals,
there is a rare possibility of postmodernist thinking, as it is assumed that it will make
the system of law redundant, remove the legitimized form of articulation and make
it baseless as languages are not necessarily representative of what one experience.
However, it also does not mean that the system of law consists of final conditional
statements of rules based on if-then logic. To reinvent we require new data, logical
structure and truth statements quite linked to the views and worldviews of people
who question the systems of law as unrepresentative and oppressive.
When we ponder upon this question about the law coming to mind, it is also
important to look at the possible avenues which drive us to think in a particular way
about the law filtered through or matching the legal sensemaking with our experiences. The colonized understanding of the law is taken in one’s subjectivity already
framed by the positive and popular view of the colonizer to the understanding of law
from the worldview of the indigenous and powerless. The need to reinvent the notion
of powerlessness through reengineering the dominant notions in society and law and
many times through the systematic uprising of the technology to find the signature of
psychological makeup within the brain embarked upon the story and experience of
the person, essentializing it, veiling the social make up and expanding consciousness
and story of the person. To relate with Adorno’s (1973) critique of objectivity and
reification, neuroscience in most cases did not form a firm association between the
history of mind and determinism of object, as we see in the case of the brain. In the
forward to Adorno’s (1973) “The jargon of authenticity”, Schroyer (1973) stated that.
“The constitutive presupposition of human subjectivity must themselves be dialectically related to the historical context in which determinate subjects are formed.
Failure to so relate the subject and object of historically situated knowledge results
in the fallacy of ‘objectivism’-or the reduction of subjectivity to the in-itselfness of
facts (e.g., positivism) or the innate principles of mind (the idealistic philosophy of
the identity of reason and mind)” (P. xi).
The case of neuroscience is well established in neurological categories. When neuroscience is associated with social and legal categories it limits the essential definition and understanding of the categories and concepts. In that process of explaining
the human mind, the deeper meaning of categories seems to be missed out. Scientific knowledge is established knowledge where a connection is drawn consensually between terminologies and the truth. The use and misuse of these terminologies
have largely limited the true connection between ascription and experience. The legal

13

256

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:247–270

discourses become limited when it is based on the dominant view of neurosciences
or popular history. This further limit the chance of expansion and solidarity to the
human being who as a willing agent is seen as lacking control and the freedom of
choice. The established model of neurosciences reflects the cause-effect relationship
which may not necessarily corresponds to the truth and social reality but only providing a utility function (e.g., Burr, 2003; Hruby, 2001) to predict one’s preconceived
biasedness, and stereotypes, attitudes, and so on.
The legal domain establishes its authenticity through the stated verdict may rely
on reasons which was applied earlier. This may indicate the post-hoc fallacy and
confirmation biases if the neuroscientific inputs are not triangulated along with other
admissible methods for valid corroboration. It is not new that scholars had tried to
look for the common thread in the metatheories such as realism and relativism and
in that variety of linkages such as the need of neurosciences to understand the brain
and the role of language adopted to represent something technical for usefulness
and change in the perceptions (see Burr, 2003; Gergen, 2009). The system of neurosciences offers a picture of the brain whose area becomes active if the person is
engaged in some thoughts, however, it is not yet clear about the kind of thought that
particularly emerges from any particularly specified area. The thought of any action
intended towards any person is simply a process that can be aligned to the brain
area being active but what exactly was the thought is the matter of consciousness,
discursive framework, and self-reporting. Looking at everything through the neuroscientific lens is like confining oneself in a box that is limited in its height, breadth,
and wideness.
Human beings tend to be curious but to resolve it through the application of reductive approach may establish one kind of cause effect relationship. The requirement to
understand the brain and its process to estimation about various human relational acts
may be a better scientific exercise that may provide an understanding of the pathways
between neurological imbalance and the person’s other biological responses. Though
this has very less to do with the exactness of the type of thought and intention. The
correlation between brain and behaviour is more an interpretation by the disciplinary
experts. However, the possibility of a true statement may be stated with certainty. This
is not to say that the probability of these neuroscientific statements does not matter
and cannot be applied at the treatment level. At the judicial level which is driven by
ideographic premises these statements probably hold the chances of error. This may
invite repressiveness in the law rather than progressiveness. We perceive different
events in our life, good, bad, normal but for the bad ones, we look for the cause with
greater force as compared to the normal events (see also Baumeister, Bratslavsky, &
Vohs, 2001). For example, why people committed suicide is one of the most thought
about question with no clear answer. We look for the context, socio-political situations, history of the place and economic condition to give the most acceptable answer
compatible with the situation and the individuals’ unique response in that situation
as compared to the other individuals. Legal scholars might construe the cause as per
the evidence giving the impression of the suitability of the best cause, for example, in
the case of suicide, the evidence presented by the neuropsychologists possibly portrays a person or victim as depressed with an earlier history of psychiatric treatment
of depression or any part of the brain having a neurobiological deficit. Finding the

13

257

cause is one of the processes of understanding and reasoning which judiciary verifies
to make a verdict. Moreover, it is the physical cause obtained through forensic methods that matters much in the inferring of the psychological ones. Since locating the
psychological cause is rather subjective and exactly unobservable, the location of the
cause along with the forensics systematically regulates the legal reasoning. Though
this is another matter that how legal reasoning, which is itself subjective, objectifies
itself with the forensics, locates the cause, and gets influenced by the numbers of
moderators and mediators like stereotype contents, groupthink, competence illusions,
cultural hegemonic thinking, dominance trends of morality laden within the power
and politics. In that denial of a larger context, the visible picture of neuroscience
looks more objective, scientific, sensible, reliable, and valid, eventually, making legal
reasoning more sophisticated.
To be mindful of law is accepting the superiority of law without much cognizance
to how legal reasoning happened with the aid of dominant superstructure, forensics,
and interpretations of others’ subjectivity. The neuroscientific view if not properly
understood may give simplistic impression about the person’s reality. The brain science attempts to show its presence in all the cognitive and behavioural functioning,
which makes up the social world, in a crude manner. Does it matter for neuroscientists to differentiate between expert kinds of thinking or majoritarian? It is quite probable that the thinking process, as it is observed, through the fMRI, shows some area
of the brain as active, and this is more important for the legal domain, whether it is the
area of manipulative thinking in a normative way or in a psychopathological way3.
Law surrounds its categories symptomatically and orients one’s thinking in a taken
for granted way to the best of recognized evidence. Evidence is interpreted through
some qualified assumptions, seemingly based on precedents and past success of the
decision in making most people agree to its authenticity.
Social and cognitive neuroscientists are interested in the number of social and
motivational aspects of the persons. Research demonstrated how people understand
self and the mental states of others, how they derive logic behind the action of the
other, and embody the perspectives of others. Research also showed how much
brain areas are automatically and in a controlled manner specify one’s action (e.g.,
Lieberman, 2007; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006; see also Arioli, Crespi, & Canessa,
2018; Healey & Grossman, 2018; Spunt & Lieberman, 2013). In both cases, it is all a
human thing to do, whereas in the legal domain it is the folk understanding of human
nature delivered through the histories, societal conjectures such as the commonsensical way of locating the cause, identities development and dominance, whereas in the
neuroscientific domain especially, social, and cognitive, the understanding of self and
others is through the mediation of brain. In the latter case, neuroscience is sophisticated and scrupulous. It has the methodological support of fascinating techniques
and instruments which specifically locate the area of the brain with increasing spatial
and temporal resolutions. To the hypothetical question ‘how do you feel when you
believe in law or vice versa?‘, a possible response may be good and bad respectively.
To the first part of the question, being a believer of law is to believe in the system
3

Some of the studies showed that psychopaths’ manipulative thinking is untraceable in cortical areas,
which usually matters in the thinking process.

13

258

of justice which makes one get relieved from the state of confusion and anxieties,
and in the second part, the non-believer in law situates themselves in the anarchical
thinking which demands complete overhauling of the system which regulates. Neuroscience is systematic and the believers in law are a high probability to believe in
this system of science as compared to the non-believer who falls out of the systematic
and deterministic way of thinking subjected to be legitimized by the state, psychiatry,
and structural viewers of society. Since the law is not universal along cultural lines,
as societal structure, language, and beliefs differ, the perception of different laws and
their applicability also differs.
The exceptionalism of the dominant culture does not warrant homogenizing the
perception, however, the imposition of dominant values connected to that exceptionalism forced to be compiled directed towards imperialistic and colonial coercion
rather than any true justice. How justice is conceived by the legal neuroscience progenitors, has much to do with the idea of justice itself where what is fitting into the
public and legal understanding of one’s agency will be more pronounced despite the
neuroscience systematic identification of active brain region in having one’s sense
of ownership of action and thoughts, agency, and self-identification. Recently, it is
argued that free action in the case of criminal proceedings, does not have a subjective
or objective probability of occurrence and only because insufficient information does
accurate prediction about free action cannot be made. Since the probability of free
action does not exist, free action cannot be predicted (see Pundik, 2020)4.

Legal Socialization, Brain, and Agency
How law comes to mind can be indescribable unless we see how the law is being
continuously used to socialize us and then our varieties of action which makes us
systematically a legal agent, whether we believe it as something delivering justice or
not. In our populist discourses, we make an impression about any phenomenon existing in terms of bipolar opposites, for example, we probably think that the opposite of
justice is injustice. To be more specific, denying a right to someone is the opposite of
giving a right, however, political philosophers approached this bipolarity in terms of
uniqueness and varieties of these bipolar opposite concepts. Thus, if neuroscientist
identifies that the lateral parietal cortex (LPAC) becomes active when the person
faces mismatches between one’s action and the sense of ownership, for example, in
the case of schizophrenics (Franck et al., 2002; Ganesan, Hunter & Spence, 2005;
see also Lieberman, 2007), what can be a better option of justice to be sanctioned by
the law as per the report of neuroscientists? Justice is inoperable unless nurtured with
socio-political values. Justice is not an entity but it is framed under the worldview
of society configured by the sequence of events in history, collective memory, wars,
crisis, attitudes and conflicts, deep-seated emotions which were suppressed by the
different regimes, oppressed-oppressor dichotomies, structure, and social identities.

Neuroscience is not taking a backseat in all of these issues and it is actively venturing through the brain mediation about the issues such as automatic filtering of the
person based on stereotypically laden schemas, controlling the function of the brain
when expressing one’s prejudice in a socially sanctioned way, formation of political
attitudes, or perception of competence in political knowledge, partisan bias, motivated political cognition and so on (e.g. Jost et al., 2014; Lieberman & Schreiber,
2003). Justice is a social process that is not limited to the procedure but also about
the substantive visibility of the outcome, a kind of reciprocity based on the idea that
every action has some equivalent consequences for the person. This action by the
person affects others socially, physically, cognitively, and emotionally, so the inherent consequence of that action seems to be received by the person as a reciprocal
response. But how then does the other who is affected by the action and intention
of the first person define justice or appropriately get justice? For example, in civil
cases, the victim of financial fraud gets justice through the compensation and possibly imprisonment of the accused of intentionally manipulating others for one’s selfinterested motive. In the criminal case, whatever be the compensation given or the
punishment sanctioned to the confirmed accused, most of the time the impact on the
victim is never redeemed and mostly it is irreversible.
Justice seems to be a process where both the parties, victim, and victimizer, lessen
their dehumanization, where a person is punished for the crime, he/she committed
and a victim drives his/her justice out of it. In the context of the criminal justice system, justice outcome plays a significant role at the same time. However, this happens
through the effect of the system and legal agents and under the influence of power. In
the legal system, the legal understanding and confirmation to the powerful progenitor, it is all the interpretation of the evidence and precedents. The legal system has
very little room for dialogue between different parties, through dialogue happens in
a limited space of media and humanities/academic circles. The need to be an expert
in the practice of justice in the court is like an interdisciplinary connection between
powerful, that is, powerful experts and powerful judges. Expert knowledge of neuroscientists is a systematic appropriation of technical knowledge presented sophisticatedly to the judges making the case for the guilt-prone mind, to be construed by the
judges either as relevant and admissible or not. Though neuroscientist presenting the
case for the brain is relevant and applicable in the treatment of the brain-damaged
patient, its theory about the activation of the brain part which is supposed to be active
while describing the past intention become debatable and not easily admissible to the
court. In the current time, if neuroscientists present the case that the Medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) and the Medial Parietal Cortex (mPAC) are active when the person
is self-conscious (e.g., Ochsner et al., 2004; Johnson & Schmitz, 2005) as compared
to the person who was engaged with some simple cognitive task (e.g., McKiernan
et al., 2003; for extensive discussion see Lieberman, 2007), may add to the legal
knowledge also. However, the debate and differences among the neuroscientists are
greater enough to lead to any detailed conclusion, except for some broad generalizations, which most of the time retain the power of juries in going by the precedents
and established legal categories. Some scholars posited that it is very difficult, if not
impossible to ascertain the first-person experience and intentions and what remains
in the air is the fitting of the established notions into the legal frameworks (e.g.,

13

260

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:247–270

Nagel, 1974), unlike other scholars who posited that “linking phenomenological with
the psychological and neural is a promising research strategy for understanding person” (see Churchland, 1986; Flanagan, 2000, 2011; Searle, 1997). Since the notions
and meaning of any category are the commonsensical representations that formed
the structure and come into our discourses, justice is not a part of these notions.
We live our brain and it is embedded in our collective repertoire whether one can
control his activities as normally others are doing, in terms of thinking, problemsolving, social relationships, verbal expressions, obedience and conformity. If those
controlled activities are not possible, either it is connoted to the will and socialization
of the person or the deficiency in some brain parts. In the latter cases, neuroscience
can help in posting whether the person intended or is it happening automatically and
the person does not have knowledge or consciousness of his/her action. If the legal
domain is sure that the action of the person is not intended, the meaning of justice
in terms of giving punishment must be relooked, and it becomes the responsibility
of the law to convince the victim party to understand that the action of the defendant was not indeed and in control. The question may arise, whether the convict was
equally unconscious of other activities which require control, which can be a decisive
point in legal decision making. Thus, neuroscience has its say but it is not that established as law. In philosophical speculation, the point of justice may not be exact but in
the legal domain, justice derived from the evidence seems exact and therapeutic. The
perception of any object in the external world is also a major area of study in psychology, for example, psychophysics. Here the external events are considered actual and
objective but seem to be perceived by the subjective mind differently. The possibility
of mismatch is provocative in philosophical speculation, as to how something subjective connects to a concrete and tangible external world. It is like a mirage that is not
real but perceived. Law does not speculate the cause through this dualism, since it
can be refuted as baseless.
Neuroscience resolves this dualism through its compatibility with the series of
input-output and action-reaction debates. It resolves the dilemma of how something
comes out of subjective by showing the localization of something active in realtime, only to be seen in the form of action in that temporality. However, modern
techniques show the brain activity, intention, and behaviour delay in milliseconds,
but this is very quick when one perceives or witnesses someone making any action.
For the judges, the time gaps in brain activity, intention and behaviour are like correspondence of causes rather than simply any impressions. Justice is, thus, a matter
of acceptance of a situation that is activated in our social partnership and collectivity,
demonstrated through the everyday symbolic use of our normative reasoning. Since
human beings cannot be neutral and they are political beings, their existence is a
politics of passions, desire and evaluations, their way of expression cannot be neutral
and thus their brain. They do politics, their brain gets activated by their actions and its
reciprocities, thus it cannot be simulated as automatons but it is all the culmination of
desires and passions superseding, though this is the different matter, that this shaping
and socialization of desires and passions are the normal instances of human lives.
The understanding of law follows many pathways such as families, schools, peers,
and media, despite one never through the court proceedings. The law is everywhere,
in our surroundings, moral acts, social relationships and in our everyday activities.

The rebellions against the repressive law are a radical movement to refuse something coercive and predatory5. This also comes under the periphery of law where
it becomes imperative to know why people sometimes disobey the law. There are
instances when people order the intensity of punishment associated with the breaching of law and fall into acts that may align them to the legal categories. The severity
of punishment associated with any action gets legitimized in everyday discourses and
registered in the brain. The question about how we get socialized with the law and
how the law understands the psychology of individuals adds to the theory of justice.
Socialization with the law is to go through psychological processes such as learning,
thinking and memory together with the macro-level facets such as the influence of
culture, power, and institutions. The legal domain while situating their decisions to
attain justice must go by the psychological appropriations also. Justice cannot be the
sole repertoire of legal categories but it must conform to the psychological categories
which make up the individuals and society. If psychology is going through the interdisciplinary phases of understanding any phenomenon at all the three levels of the
social, cognitive, and neural (Ochsner & Lieberman, 2001), then the law which is in
no way confine itself to the ivory tower of legal categories, established and normative assumption, and precedents, and inadvertently must shape its assumptions at all
those levels respectively. Since the law is also a social process of imparting justice,
its interdisciplinary alignment with psychology and neuroscience has a social connection too. Just citing the atomist and discrete process of the brain will not feed
the broad and general form of understanding of human actions. How can we be sure
that any neural firing supposedly corresponds to the social process? However, the
observations show a clear relationship between the brain and act. The correlation of
the neural activities and behaviour together with the interpretations based on social
norms and rule of law makes the whole dynamic a social enterprise. The social experience as a legal experience and vice versa goes together in society at the general
level. Though these social and legal experiences understood through the standards
do not fully account for the qualitative experiences and phenomenon, it is the theory
of mind that we hold logically towards the externally focused situations that matter
dominantly. In one study on empathetic understanding, Singer et al. (2006) showed
that “it is unclear whether subjects are imagining their own experience of pain or
truly empathizing by the perceived fairness of others” (as cited in Lieberman, 2007,
p. 265). Neuroscience has given a systematic account of the brain, but the qualitative
experience is within the memory of the person and the way he/she can communicate
it.
The way people communicate their intentions and subjective feelings are not
always conveyed through the standard format to be understood, these accounts have
the potential to be incomplete. Law’s control is paramount which gives meaning to
society. Melton (1992) pointed out that the idea of culture is announced by the law
and gives a statement of cultural identity. He further stated that “the law is a social
glue that offers cues for behaviour consistent with respect for the community and
the person it subsumes’’ (p. 384). The notion of culture and identity as sanctioned by
law was appreciated by few scholars in support of the law as a good thing. However,
5

See Appadurai, A. (2006). Fear of small numbers: an essay on the geography of anger.

13

262

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:247–270

it was not clear how the meaning of culture and identity emerges and why there
are hierarchies like inferior and superior cultures and identities (see also Han et al.
2013a, b). Since the law, science, and society connect, it is absurd to say that law
is fixed, as it is observed in history and present that science and society shift. If the
law is assumed to be fixed, it is an example of reification and rigidification of social
objects, phenomena and identities and is not much benefit to the justice system. Science is a continuous process and it comes out with an evidentiary principle in a
reliable way. Since categories of sciences are also amenable to new instruments and
questions, the neutral picture of science is also questionable as it is the society and
scientists’ worldviews that constructs the idea of something as fact.

Law and Critical Neuroscience
In the case of law and neuroscience connection, the derivative force is the evidence
that neuroscience provides to aid legal decision making. There is little evidence
available that shows the law is actively involved with critical neuroscience. There
are some areas like critical legal studies which have the potential to inform the legal
domain about the authentic interdisciplinary connection of law and neurosciences.
The antagonism against the indigenous conforms to the epistemological violence
towards their culture and subjective experiences (e.g., Teo, 2010). The objective and
imposed knowledge indicate its oppressive nature when it finds it difficult to form an
association with the subjective aspect of the locale mind (Smith, 1999). In all cases, it
is the mind tools that are designed to interpret subjectivity. They seem to be designed
by the powerful disciplinary domains. Critical neuroscience addresses these issues
and has the potential to connect with the law sustainably.
The question about our understanding of the law needs a better perspective where
we can understand how law intervenes in our everyday consciousness and confirm its
metatheory. The law as defined by whom and as who are the people construct law for
the prevention and detention need to be understood in a wider sociocultural domain
(Tyler, 2006). The idea of law to be imposed to see the right kind of behaviour or law
aligned to the people in their heterogeneity complying with the universal values. The
psychological input to the vagaries of law is in terms of obedience and conformity,
which is a need to go by the hierarchy of thought, language, and status. The law is
not understood unless it is the person who encounters anomalies and alters what he
and she believe to have taken for granted in theory, acts and thoughts. The simplifying language that neuroscience adopts to frame the case of brain involvement in the
complex behaviour of people is appreciated and granted a major starting point for all
the actions and thoughts. If this is so then the law seems also a business of neuroscience. The demarcation of the society regulated by law and reciprocally contributing
to the law through moral principles also seem to be possibly explained by neuroscience and may be observed in everyday legal discourses. In other ways, neural firings
in some areas of the brain in a situation make the person powerful or anxious and
that is what impels the brain to experience the difference in legal consciousness and
societal events. But how much can we be sure or bent ourselves to this idea that the
brain is the powerful agent, all-encompassing and it is the brain only which creates

our world? In the earlier work on the brain, free will and law it was discussed that free
will can be a valid one and it is not that the brain is so much laden with the stimuli
around that all activity of humans is determined. This is not to argue that it is all the
free will and any kind of brain determinism is not the possibility.
Zeki (1993) argued for the existence of neurological inputs without despising the
will and consciousness and stated in this wider context that “no theory of the brain
is complete if it cannot give a scientific account of the subjectivity of mental states”
(p. 5). Further, the inter-subjectivity question which accounts for the reciprocity in
understanding the people and the social world will be having a limited snapshot kind
of model. Neuroscience is expanding its research into varieties of the domain and
its metatheory is limited to the reductive understanding of the human brain which
portrays a simple model of human complex actions and thoughts. Being sophisticated and under the influence of limited metatheory, bounds neurosciences become
a grand approach or being part of human and social science. Thus, its disconnection
from everyday activities and offering an explanatory picture by seeking information
about the people’s social relationships is an unnecessary imposition of the will of
neurosciences on the complex will of people. Since law believes in the individual
narrative and is ideographic, the insufficient connection of neurosciences to the social
cognitive enterprise of people shows how the law is not going to be challenged by
the neurosciences and since it is the emergence of the field of interest to know human
brain from a long time through different techniques that do not seem going to change
the legal verdict made in the past nor it would deskill the lawyers from their intuitions and precedents. However, the neurosciences do not go to lose their importance
because it shows the brain’s involvement in acts and thoughts, and the latter does not
emerge without any context. The primacy of law in its willingness to give the verdict
based on responsibility and accountability still does not make the legal agent libertarian. As Kane (2007) noted that we do not have proof of the existence of acts that are
sole without cause and how can something which does not have true cause make us
accountable?
The legal decisions and verdicts are assumed to be justified based on available
evidence. They depend upon the questions the people are interested, for example,
legal question or the scientific question (Morse, 2016). It is the new evidence only
that may claim the limitations of earlier decision making which further impels the
legal agents to look back at the earlier evidence and their authenticities. How to be
sure that the evidence available is sufficient to prove an accused guilty? The justice
system is an operational system where outcomes matter and most of the time the
content which led to this outcome is not in the social and cognitive periphery of the
people. The judicial verdict had a long-term impact on the psyche of people despite
the new expert evidence and refutation of earlier evidence and interpretations (Asokan, 2016; Biedermann & Kotsoglou, 2018). Though, the reliance on evidentiary
principles which are continuously advancing with new methods and techniques, may
not remove the stain which fed the stereotypes or nurtured the first impression in the
society. These impressions come under public intelligence and are passed through
different channels. The irony of legal socialization is in its reification of consciousness and impressions which are constructed and reconstructed in collective memories
and becomes the truth. Since vocabularies do not assure the truth of individuals’

subjectivities, any recall of the memories can also be not relied upon as it is. It still
does not reveal why the brain led to the reconstruction of memories. Whether it is an
individual’s life, legal domain, or any social institutions, the essence of something
personally related like a flashbulb or episodic will define our memory but the other
challenges available in the context, in our activities and sense-making will nurture
the memory, the way our will strands it (Patihis et al., 2014). For instance, during
the eyewitness testimony, the chances of overestimation, misinformation and guided
stereotypes may construct and co-construct the memory of evidence and its interpretations (Loftus, 2017). In an innocent project where care is taken not to punish the
innocent due to misinterpretation of evidence or lack of a best possible method to
conclude, the vitriol use of witnesses and creating a false image of reality may create
a factual understanding of one’s systemic involvement in the events, that never happened (See Loftus & Pickrell, 1995; Woolston, 2017).
The role of neuroscientists and psychologists as an expert in the judicial proceedings to give their memory view is sometimes not entertained by the judges and
rejected as embarrassing and unreliable. The legal domain is skeptical about the
methods designed to understand the subjectivities and even the most sophisticated
methods prevalent in these fields are questioned as unsuitable and meta-theoretically
limited (see also Monahan & Loftus, 1982). Does realization of one’s intentions
and actions as wrong and morally incorrect make the person less vulnerable to legal
punishment? Common sense indicates that ‘once an accused, always an accused’,
though this labelling seems to get moderated by many events at the micro and macro
level. A positive attitude towards the person either belonging to one’s group may
dilute the effect and enhance the empathy factor as compared to the attributions in
the context of an outgroup. Some studies explored the relationship between learning
and enhancement of empathy in the brain towards the outgroup. For example, Hein,
Engalman, Vollberg, & Tobler (2016) showed that classical learning signals update
empathetic brain responses and few positive experiences and emotions towards the
outgroup were sufficient to increase out-group empathy, giving an affirmative sign of
plasticity of the brain in terms of empathetic reactions, perspective-taking and empathy. How much the law regulates, becomes responsive and derives the usefulness of
any evidence from the expert’s viewpoint, depends upon the system of beliefs that
any society holds as a normative belief about one’s roles, responsibilities, and internalization of rules. The society which is based on scientific belief looks for the useful
designs, intrinsic values, and exactitude of any theory to be replicated and confirmed
(Polanyi, 1966). Laws vary in those societies either as regulatory and autonomous or
as responsive towards the varieties of ideas provided, they do not feed the nonsense.
Neuroscience has systematically upgraded itself in modern society and can form a
discourse of power to be convened by the law. In traditional societies, its status and
emergence in the form of discourse of power are still in an ambivalent state.
The coming of neuroscience in the periphery of law and if not utilized within the
standard of law and society, speculation is that neuroscience will change the picture
of the law in the eye of society (Green & Cohen, 2004). Similarly, for neuroscientists,
it is exactly what they do by showing the picture of the brain through the natural controls (posthoc situation only), developing the meaning of the case (e.g., neurological
deficit). Some of the studies using mass empirical analysis and task-free fMRI data

pointed toward the replication crisis in brain imaging studies and neuroscience (e.g.
Eklund, Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016; Szucs & Loannidis, 2017), where they noted
that “the parametric statistical methods used for group fMRI analysis with the packages Swift Package Manager (SPM), FSL, and Analysis of Functional Neuroimages
(AFNI) can produce Family Wise Error (FEW)-corrected cluster P values that are
erroneous, being spuriously low and inflating statistical significance” (p. 7903), thus
suggesting to embrace nonparametric analysis with the fewer assumption6. As per
the above evidence, chances seem to be high that even the experts appointed by the
prosecutor or defendant to show the authenticity of evidence based on the published
paper, may fall into the self-serving bias of overestimating the reliability of their findings, thus creating a possibility of distortions. The perceived normative significance
of neuroscience may trigger a peak of inflated expectations (see Schleim, 2014). This
also creates people’s explanatory preference for scientific phenomena suggesting that
“people’s sense of the relations among scientific fields are fairly well-calibrated but
display some general attraction to neuroscience” (e.g., Weisberg, Hopkins & Taylor,
2018; p. 1). It is the accuracy of the data that matters in the subjective understanding
of a phenomenon in terms of teleological and longer explanations (see Lombrozo &
Carey, 2006) with many causal factors (see Zemla, Sloman, Bechlivanidis, & Lagnado, 2017). Some of the research showed that judges may get allured by neuroscientific evidence (e.g., Jones et al., 2015). This was also stated as a seductive allure
effect which states that “people without advanced training prefer explanations for
psychological phenomena when those explanations include a neuroscience component, even when that component is irrelevant to the logic of the explanation” (as cited
in Weisberg, Hopkins & Taylor, 2018. p. 2).
The meaning of socialization is laden with the pathways through which it happens, the progenitors of science socialize through the authenticity of methods through
which any conclusion is reached. As individuals from different sections of society
derive the legitimacy of law from sources considered to be authoritative by common
understanding, the reason to accept and be driven by the logic of law as legitimate
and defending the system is a paramount factor for one to be considered as a responsible citizen. The law is there to create responsible citizens who will be working for
the advancement of society and culture based on normative ways of dos and don’ts.
The system of morality is a matter of culture that is preserved by law. If neuroscience is scientific and authentic its interpretation by the legitimate expert orientations
towards the systematic contribution to society and law. Since at most of the levels,
society is considered to be in the institutions, family culture, social relations and
adherence to authority, which is a normal way of seeing the world, self and social
objects, so the construction of morality depends upon this normal way of living. Neuroscience, as a normal science will be adhered to the systematic and normal societal
discourse and will be useful to the law to the point it helps it to regulate society based
on derived morality.

Conclusion
The brain mould through the social stimuli to develop the capacity to perceive self
and others in the social context. If we focus on the self, society, and culture, the
response seems to be positive as there is no other scientific measure, in terms of
observation, to rely on the continuity of the brain. In the legal domain time matters
and any imposition or ascription is scientifically inappropriate, as consciousness of
oneself and others shifts because of the development and maturation. Going by the
theory of Vygotsky, the competent others who comprise the society and dominant
individuals also nurtures the perception about oneself and others, as the brain captures the bombardment of social, emotional, and cognitive stimuli to shape the identity of the person in the present (Luria, 1980a).
If law is to be understood as per the legal doctrine by the people, it will solve the
misalignment issues of what one sees himself/herself and societal expectations. It
also depends upon the experiences and maturity, where some understand the law as
per the instructions about the conventional norms (e.g., teachers, parents, institutions), some live law as part of their moral selves and some are dissenting to the
majoritarian and blind acceptance of repressive (or otherwise) law. Technically, making sense of law is about our socio-cognitive process which is derived through interactions with the social norms, institutions, and socializations. It consists of the way
we process the social information, the way our brain becomes habituated in giving
stereotypical responses and our everyday social behaviour. It is also about our emotions, the way we feel fearful of law or have some assurance that the law is them to
give us a meaningful and dignified existence within the social space. Le doux (2003)
study systematically called our attention to the programming of our brain as an evolutionary object in which Amygdala is seen as a primitive structure and its response
to any illusion is a matter of survival. However, it is neocortex which assures through
reasoning that the fear is unfounded. The law as it was seen in the history as in many
a case regressive where the dominance of hierarchy has imposed oppressive value on
the masses. At the same time the collective sensemaking of the oppressive law was
reformed through collective struggle. Our brain is an adaptive organ and seeing it in
a deterministic manner limits its ever adapting and changing picture. The way we
make sense of law is our response to the context and a socio-political system which
either programme our free will in a narrowed sense or gives us a power to bring
social change and a new insight to the hegemonical system. The interaction of the
neuroscience with the law needs to be critically seen as both the domain evolve with
the changing times for social justice.

The title refers to the free will theorem by Conway and Kochen whose flashy formulation is as follows: If
experimenters possess free will, then so do particles. In more modest terms, the theorem says that individual
pairs of spacelike separated particles cannot be described by deterministic systems provided their mixture is the
same for all choices of measurement settings. We reformulate and generalize the free will theorem in terms of
systems of random variables and show that the proof is based on two observations: (1) Some compound systems
are contextual (nonlocal), and (2) any deterministic system with spacelike separated components is nonsignaling.
The contradiction between the two is obtained by showing that a mixture of nonsignaling deterministic systems,
if they exist, is always noncontextual. The “experimenters’ free will” (independence) assumption is not needed
for the proof: It is made redundant by the assumption (1) above, critical for the proof. We next argue that the
reason why an individual pair of particles is not described by a deterministic system is more elementary than in
the free will theorem. A system, contextual or not and deterministic or not, includes several choices of settings,
each of which can be factually used without changing the system. An individual pair of particles can only afford
a single realization of random variables for a single choice of settings. With this conceptualization, the “free will
of experimenters” cannot be even meaningfully formulated, and the choice between the determinism and “free
will of particles” becomes arbitrary and inconsequential.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper the issues related to the free will theorem
(FWT) [1,2] are discussed in terms of random variables. Conway and Kochen [2,3] emphasize that their theorem does not
use probabilistic notions. This seems to plunge our paper in a
controversy from the outset [3–5]: Our analysis of the FWT
would be suspect if we used conceptual means that are not
acceptable in the original formulation of the theorem. This
is not the case, however. We use the language of random
variables to describe quantum experiments, involving large
numbers of replications with multitudes of particles. On the
level of individual particles (more specifically, individual pairs
of entangled particles), our focus, the same as in the original
FWT, is exclusively on whether they can be described as
systems of deterministic outcomes (which are, of course, a
special case of random variables). Probabilistic description of
quantum experiments is hardly controversial, and we have a
good demonstration of the benefits it offers for the FWT in
Ref. [6]. Moreover, it is unavoidable. It is known [5,6] that the

FWT can be found or extracted from much earlier work than
[1,2], with the Kochen-Specker system used by Conway and
Kochen being replaced with other contextual systems (in fact,
any contextual system, as we will see later). The contextuality
of many of these systems is more saliently probabilisitic than
that of the Kochen-Specker system. This prominently includes
the EPR-Bohm system, with a variant of the FWT being
already seen in Bell’s pioneering work [7].
Our reformulations lead us to critically reexamine and
modify the FWT, although not invalidate it. In particular, we
show that the assumption of the free will of experimenters
(or independence assumption, as many authors prefer to call
it [6,8–12]) is not needed in the FWT. This assumption is
only needed to ensure that experimental observations correctly identify the system experimented on as contextual. It
is therefore made unnecessary by another assumption, critical for the FWT and underivable from the independence
assumption—that a contextual system with certain properties exists. Furthermore, we argue that while the question of
whether individual particles can be described by deterministic
systems is indeed to be answered negatively, and while the
FWT is indeed one way of demonstrating this, there is a more
elementary reason for this negative answer: The notion of a
system, deterministic or not, is not applicable to an individual
pair of particles to begin with. The latter is a realization
of random variables for a single choice of settings, whereas
the notion of a system involves several mutually exclusive
settings, each of which can be factually and repeatedly used.
Our analysis is based on the contextuality-by-default
(CbD) theory (e.g., Refs. [13–15]), but its utilization in this

paper is confined to only two basic principles. The first one
is that each random variable is identified not only by the
property it measures but also by the context (settings) in
which it measures this property. The second principle is that
no two random variables recorded in different, mutually exclusive contexts possess a joint distribution. Moreover, these
principles are only applied to a special subset of systems of
random variables, the compound, “Alice-Bob”-type systems
with spacelike separation. These systems are nonsignaling,
and this makes it unnecessary for us to invoke most of the
content of CbD. Because of this the reader need not be familiar with CbD to understand this paper.
However, a brief comment may be needed on the two
principles just mentioned. The double indexation of random
variables means that if Alice chooses a setting x and Bob
chooses a setting y, their measurement outcomes (random
variables) are represented as, respectively, Ax,y and Bx,y . And
if Bob changes his setting to y while Alice maintains her
setting, her measurement is represented by another random

variable, Ax,y . A reader might erroneously interpret this as indicating that Bob somehow influences Alice’s measurements
despite their spacelike separation (a “spooky action at a dis
tance”). This is not the case. The distribution of Ax,y is the
same as that of Ax,y , so Bob transfers no information to Alice.

There is no “action.” The difference between Ax,y and Ax,y
simply reflects the relational nature of random variables in
classical probability theory. A random variable is a measurable function on a probability space, and any variable defined
on the same space is jointly distributed with it: Their observed

realizations are paired. Therefore, if Ax,y and Ax,y were the
same random variable, they would be jointly distributed. But
this would mean that realizations of Ax,y and realizations of

Ax,y co-occur (and are equal), while in reality they occur in
mutually exclusive contexts.1
The scheme of the paper is as follows. In the next section
we introduce formal notions and definitions related to systems
of random variables. In Secs. III and IV we present the FWT
in the language of such systems. In Sec. V we show that a
systematic use of the language of random variables makes the
FWT unnecessary (though not wrong): The experimenter’ free
will (independence) becomes unformulable, and the choice
between the determinism and free will of particles becomes
arbitrary and inconsequential. The concluding section provides a brief summary.
II. PRELIMINARIES

A compound system of random variables is an indexed set
of random variables,
R = {(Ax,y , Bx,y ) : (x, y) ∈ C},

(1)

1
Without elaborating (see Refs. [15,16] for detailed argument),
another way of understanding the contextual labeling is to observe
that if one dropped the second superscript in Ax,y and the first superscript in Bx,y , the system would have to be noncontextual (due
to the fact that joint distributions of X, Y and of Y, Z imply the
joint distribution of X, Y, Z). The existence of contextual systems
therefore is a reductio ad absurdum proof that contextual labeling is
necessary.

where x is a property measured by Alice, y is a property measured by Bob, (x, y) is the context in which the measurements
are made, and C is a set of all possible contexts. Every random
variable therefore is identified by the property it measures and
the context in which it measures it. To simplify discussion,
we will assume that all random variables have a finite number
of values. The properties x, y are also referred to as settings,
although there is the obvious semantic difference: A setting
x designates the decision and arrangements made to measure
property x.
Alice and Bob are always assumed to be spacelike separated. Because of this, by special relativity, the system is
nonsignaling: The distributions of the variables are contextindependent,

with C = {x = 1, . . . , x = 40} × {y = 1, . . . , y = 33}. In
REPRB , the x values and y values enumerate choices of axes
by Alice and Bob, and the random variables are 0/1 (say, spin
values in spin-1/2 particles). In RKSP , the y values represent 33
special axes in Peres’s proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem
[19], and the x values encode 40 Peres’s triples formed using
these 33 axes; the A variables have values 011,101,110, and
the B variables are 0/1.
Any two random variables recorded in the same context, and referred to as an AB pair, are jointly distributed:
This means that Pr [Ax,y = a, Bx,y = b] is well defined for
(x, y) ∈ C. However, two random variables from different
contexts are stochastically unrelated, i.e., have no joint distribution; i.e., if (x, y) = (x  , y ), then the event conjunctions







[Ax,y = a, Ax ,y = a ], [Ax,y = a, Bx ,y = b], etc., are not welldefined events, and no probabilities can be assigned to them.
This formal distinction reflects the obvious fact that random
variables from mutually exclusive contexts can never be observed together, in any empirical meaning of “together.” In

particular, Ax,y and Ax,y in (2) are not equal, because they are
not jointly distributed. All this means that the system R in (1)
is a collection of stochastically unrelated AB pairs, combined
within a single system only because every AB pair shares at
least one property it measures with at least one other AB pair.
Random variables attaining a given value with probability
1 are deterministic variables. A deterministic system is a
system containing only deterministic variables. Thus, the two
systems below are deterministic versions of the EPR-Bohm

In presenting these deterministic systems we conveniently
identify the random variables with their supports, say, writing
0 instead of A2,1 ≡ 0 (≡ meaning “equal with probability
1”). Because one loses the indexation as a result, one has to
indicate for each number what properties it measures (at the
bottom of the tables).
Note that we use capital Roman letters to designate random
variables, and the script letters R, D to refer to systems—
because a system is not a random variable, it is a set of
stochastically unrelated random variables (the AB pairs).
A coupling R̄ for a system R is an identically doublelabeled set of jointly distributed random variables
R̄ = {Āx,y , B̄x,y : (x, y) ∈ C},

dist

(Āx,y , B̄x,y ) = (Ax,y , Bx,y ),

(8)

for every (x, y) ∈ C. Note that we can write R̄ rather than R̄
in (7) because a coupling is a random variable in its own right.

A (nonsignaling) compound system R is noncontextual if

and

Pr[B̄x,y = B̄x ,y ] = 1,

(12)

whenever the indicated contexts are defined (belong to C). If
such a coupling does not exist, the system is contextual.
Overlooking logical subtleties [16], this definition is equivalent to the traditional definitions of contextuality and locality,
in terms of the nonexistence of joint distributions for singleindexed random variables [20] and in terms of hidden
variables with noncontextual or local mapping into observables [7,18]. Perhaps this becomes more clear on observing
that noncontextuality is equivalent to the existence of a set of
jointly distributed single-indexed random variables
R̃ = {Ãx , B̃y : (x, y) ∈ C},

(13)

such that

If all AB pairs in a compound system R are set to specific
values, then the resulting system is called a realization of R.
The reason this has to be presented as a definition is that,
unlike a realization of a random variable (e.g., an AB pair),
a realization of a system is not an observable outcome of
any experiment: It is a pure mathematical abstraction, as the
variables do not co-occur across contexts. Recall that each
random variable in R is finite valued, because of which the set
of possible realizations of R is finite. Thus, the system REPRB
has 44 realizations, whereas RKSP has 640·33 realizations.
The question posed in the FWT theorem can be formulated
thusly: Given that an idealized experiment involving an unlimited number of particle pairs is described by a system R, is it
possible that each individual pair of particles is a deterministic
system that coincides with one of the realizations of R? The
crux of the issue here is in whether the realizations of the
systems can describe individual particle pairs. If not for this
constraint, it would be innocuous (although still objectionable,
as we will see later) to say that the system R is presentable

with no restrictions on the codomain set of values: Random vectors
and random sets therefore are also random variables.

However, in the question asked by the FWT, these deterministic systems are assumed to describe real physical entities
(particle pairs), because of which they should be physically

and have to be nonsignaling. For instance, in the decomposi

is not allowed.

nonsignaling, i.e., f (i, x, y) = f (i, x) and g(i, x, y) = g(i, y)
for each  = i, we have
(Āx,y , B̄x,y ) = ( f (, x), g(, y)),

which is a local (i.e., noncontextual) model with  as a hidden
variable.
Applying this theorem to RKSP used in Conway and
Kochen’s proof, this system has no nonsignaling realizations
(by the Kochen-Specker theorem). Rather surprisingly therefore, the proof of the Conway-Kochen version of the FWT is
contained in the first sentence of the proof above. For REPRB ,
we have 16 nonsignaling realizations of this system, and the
proof says that their mixtures can only be noncontextual.
IV. WHERE IS THE FREE WILL ASSUMPTION
IN THE PROOF?

The formulations and proofs given in the previous section
do not even mention the hypothetical freedom with which
Alice and Bob choose their settings. How is it possible?
The answer is that the experimenters’ free will assumption
is indeed redundant. The proof above is contingent on the
assumption that R is a correct description of an idealized
experiment involving an unlimited number of particle pairs,
those whereof we ask whether they could be deterministic systems. The experimenters’ free will is only needed to dismiss
a conspiracy of nature leading to an incorrect identification of
the system in such an experiment. Let us explain this using the
system REPRB .
Consider the possibility that in an EPR-Bohm experiment
only four types of entangled particle pairs are possible, described by the deterministic systems

for all (x, y), (x  , y) ∈ C. By definition then, R is noncontextual, contrary to the theorem’s premise.
Equivalently, and perhaps more familiar to physicists, the
proof could be formulated as a demonstration that R has a
local hidden variable model. Using the same  as in the proof,
we have a coupling R̄ of R such that
(Āx,y , B̄x,y ) = ( f (, x, y), g(, x, y)),

(20)

where for each value  = i and each (x, y), the function
( f , g) reads the value of (aix,y , bx,y

Then the true system REPRB obtained from any mixture of
these four systems is noncontextual. Suppose, however, that
whenever Alice and Bob choose (x, y) = (1, 1) or (2, 1) (the
first and third rows in the matrices), the nature chooses to
supply a pair of particles described either by D1 or by D2 ,
equiprobably; whereas for (x, y) = (1, 2) and (2, 2) (the second and fourth rows in the matrices) the nature chooses
between D3 and D4 equiprobably. Neither Alice nor Bob
nor anyone analyzing their experimental data has any way of
knowing this. Following many replications, the results will be
a statistical estimate of a system in which all random variables

(the TWIN assumption). With these postulates, however, the
independence (part of their MIN assumption) is not needed.3
Summarizing, the independence (or “experimenters’ free
will”) is only needed if we consider the epistemological
question: How can one be sure that the compound system
estimated from an experiment is truly contextual? The FWT
is a conditional statement: If we have a contextual compound
system with certain properties, it cannot be decomposed as in
(15).

(24)

This is a nonsignaling contextual system (a PR box [21]), and
if used in the proof of the FWT in place of what we assumed
to be the true system, it will lead one to the wrong conclusion
that no decomposition (15) is possible.
To avoid such conspiratorial scenarios one can postulate
that the distribution of the nonsignaling deterministic systems
in (15) is the same for all contexts (all choices of settings).
This can be interpreted in terms of Alice’s and Bob’s free
will, but does not have to. It would be better therefore to call
this assumption unbiasedness, but not to multiply terminology
we follow the authors who call it (measurement or setting)independence. The assumption, of course, is consistent
with the choices of settings being perfectly predetermined,
but simply uncorrelated with the occurrences of the different
types of deterministic systems. Moreover, Alice’s and Bob’s
choices may very well be correlated, it makes no difference.
The example just given, of a noncontextual system being
mistaken for a contextual one, suggests the logical possibility
of taking the decomposition (15) for granted, and accounting for the (apparent) contextuality of the observed system
R either by relaxing the requirement of nonsignaling of the
deterministic systems Di or by exploring deviations from the
independence assumption. There is an obvious reciprocity
between the two, and it has indeed been researched and quantified [8–11]. This line of study is outside the scope of our
paper. In the FWT we are only interested in whether individual
particle pairs can be described by deterministic nonsignaling
systems, and the answer given is negative.
As the above reasoning shows, the independence assumption is not a necessary premise of this theorem, because it
is obviated by the critical assumption that certain contextual
systems exist. The situation is this:
(i) if we do not assume, e.g., that REPRB for certain
quadruples of axes is contextual, then the FWT for this system
cannot be proved whether or not one adopts the independence
assumption; and
(ii) if we do assume the contextuality of REPRB (presumably because we believe experiments or quantum-mechanical
theory), the proof can be carried out without mentioning the
independence assumption.
Analogously, Conway and Kochen have to postulate the
existence of a system RKSP with certain properties (the SPIN
assumption), ensuring that no consistent assignment of values to Alice’s measurements is possible (the Kochen-Specker
theorem); and they also have to postulate that if Bob’s axis
coincides with one of the three axes chosen by Alice, then
the corresponding measurement outcomes always coincide

V. SYSTEMS VERSUS ISOLATED AB PAIRS

There is, however, a simpler reason not to use deterministic
systems when describing individual particle pairs. The reason
is that a single pair of particles is a realization of an isolated
AB pair of a system rather than a realization of an entire
system. The difference is that the AB pair is determined by the
factual context chosen by Alice and Bob, while any given realization of a system also includes the counterfactual contexts
that Alice and Bob “could have chosen.” Thus, experimental
trials for REPRB produce a series of outcomes, such as

We see no logical reason to think that the observed value
(A1,2 , B1,2 ) = (0, 1) is somehow related to any specific values
of the AB pairs for contexts other than the factual (x, y) =
(1, 2). Such a relation would only be reasonable if there
existed a way to observe these alternative AB pairs by factually performing the measurements for (x, y) = (1, 1), (2, 1),
and (2, 2) in addition to (x, y) = (1, 2) on the same pair
of particles. This is, however, impossible, and not because
a projective measurement is known to destroy the state of
entanglement. We are not allowed to use quantum mechanical
considerations when conceptually testing the standard quantum mechanical view of elementary particles.4 The reason we

As noted by critics of the FWT [4,5], MIN is not a rigorous statement. It speaks of Alice and Bob’s choices as being made “freely”
and “independently,” of which the former we translate into the independence assumption. The “independently” of Conway and Kochen
apparently means that Alice’s and Bob’s choices are combined in all
possible ways. This assumption is not needed either. Thus, it is easy
to see that in the system RKSP one can delete all rows in which Bob’s
axis is not one of the three axes chosen by Alice. The assumption in
question then will be violated, but the proof of the (original) FWT
will not change at all (MIN also includes a statement that can be
interpreted as nonsignaling principle).
4
In fact, it has recently been established [22,23] that a sequence
of POVM-represented measurements (each of which depends on
the settings and outcomes of the previous measurements) can be
performed on the same pair of entangled particles without affecting
the entanglement state.

cannot speak of “the same” pair of entangled particles being
measured repeatedly using variable settings is logical rather
than physical. It is critical for our analysis that all particle
pairs be generated and prepared in precisely the same way,
and their spin values, for any given choice of settings, be
measured in precisely the same way. A pair of particles after a
measurement has been performed on it simply is not the same
pair as it was before, and it should be relabeled accordingly.
Barring such relabeling, a sequence like (25) should be treated
as several (here, four) unrelated to each other sequences, each
defined by a specific context.
One may now ask seemingly the same question as in the
FWT but applied to pairs of particles treated as realizations
of specific AB pairs: Can they be considered deterministic
variables? In other words, the question is whether each pair
of particles can be described as
Ax,y ≡ ax,y

Bx,y ≡ bx,y ,

(26)

with the specific settings (x, y) under which the measurements
are recorded. This is, however, a very different question,
and the answer is yes, if one so wishes, but this makes no
difference. Flips of a fair coin can always be considered a
mixture of two deterministic variables with respective values
head and tail, each occurring with probability 1/2. Following
the prevailing tradition in statistics, a sequence of realizations
of an AB pair can be treated as a realization of a random
sample (a set of identically distributed independent random
variables). However, it can also be treated as a realization of
a set of different random variables (e.g., deterministic ones),
randomly alternating. Let us again use REPRB for an illustration. Assume that one of its AB pairs is distributed as
(1, 1)

We see that the question of whether the individual pairs of
particles have “free will” of their own, i.e., whether they are
deterministic entities, loses its meaning.
It should also be noted that once this contextwise view
of the individual particle pairs is adopted, one need not be
concerned with the independence assumption (“free will” of
Alice and Bob). In fact this assumption now is unformulable.
Each AB pair corresponds to a fixed context, and one cannot
informatively say that the AB pair in a given context does not
depend on context.
VI. CONCLUSION

To summarize, the view that follows from the conceptual
framework of CbD does not invalidate the FWT-type theorems, but makes them unnecessary. These theorems can be
viewed as reductio ad absurdum demonstrations that individual pairs of particles cannot be viewed as deterministic
systems. CbD allows one to streamline these demonstrations,
ridding them of unnecessary assumptions. Moreover, CbD
leads one to the view that the individual pairs of particles
should not be viewed as systems to begin with, only as realizations of random variables for a given choice of settings.
As Peres famously put it, “unperformed experiments have
no results” [24]—and these nonexisting results should not be
appended to factual results, lest one runs into a contradiction.
The reason we can speak of R in (1) as a system is that as we
switch from one context to another, all other macroscopic circumstances of measurements (overall experimental set-up and
preparation procedure) remain the same. We can repeatedly
experiment with such a system without changing its defining
parameters. In particular, a deterministic system allows one to
repeatedly experiment with it and obtain the same results for
any given context. Individual pairs of particles, unless they
change their identity, afford only one pair of measurements,
in one particular context.

Freeing the Will from Neurophilosophy: Voluntary Action in
Thomas Aquinas and Libet-Style Experiments

Abstract: This essay presents a substantive Thomist response to neurophilosophy’s main experimental
challenge to free will: the Libet-style experiments on the neural antecedents of conscious voluntary
actions. My response to this challenge will disclose that Thomists are rationally justified in rejecting
both the conclusions of neurophilosophy skeptics of free will, and more fundamentally, the rival
philosophical conceptions of voluntary action and free will that were chosen to be operationalized
in these neuroscientific experiments. I show how the Thomists’ alternative conception of human
action justifies a significantly different interpretation of Libet-style experiments, one which reveals
the psychological phenomenon targeted by these experiments is miscategorized as a voluntary action.

Thomists have made important contributions to contemporary debates concerning
moral psychology, practical reasoning, human action, virtues, and free will. These contributions teach us how to situate Thomas Aquinas’s enquiries and insights within these forums
and how to ask and respond to contemporary philosophical questions and objections that
Aquinas could not have entertained. Yet Thomists have been largely silent on the neuroscientific challenges to free will.1 It is the aim of this essay to provide a substantive Thomist
response to neurophilosophy’s main experimental challenge to free will: the Libet-style
experiments on the neural antecedents of conscious voluntary actions. By “neurophilosophy”, I mean the neuroscience version of a scientific naturalizing approach to philosophical
questions, which contends neuroscience can take over and resolve certain philosophical
problems.2 My response to this challenge will disclose that Thomists are rationally justified
in rejecting the conclusions of neurophilosophy skeptics of free will because they already
reject the rival philosophical conceptions of voluntary action and free will that were chosen
to be operationalized in these neuroscientific experiments.
I begin with a digest of the Libet-style experiments on the neuroscience of human
agency and their purported challenge to free will. Next, I introduce four major problems
with the causal theory of action, which is operationalized in the Libet-style experiments. I
then argue Thomists do not face these problems because we endorse a rival conception of
voluntary action which rejects the very theses that generate these problems for the causal
theory of action. In the final section I show that because Thomists reject the causal theory
operationalized in the Libet-style experiments, Thomists also reject neurophilosophy’s
skepticism of free will based on these experiments. What the Thomists’ rival conception of
voluntary action provides is an alternative interpretation of the Libet-style experiments.
This Thomist re-interpretation, I argue, reveals that the psychological phenomenon these
experiments target and conceptualize as essential to voluntary action is in fact an instance

of a nonvoluntary passion that has been misconstrued in the Libet-style experiments. Accordingly, this essay embodies a MacIntyrean case study for how Thomists can engage
scientific contentions—and their underlying philosophical assumptions—which purport
to undermine key theses of the Thomist tradition of rational enquiry, like the place of
voluntary action and free will in philosophical anthropology. It identifies internal problems
with a rival philosophical tradition’s account of free will, shows how those difficulties are
inherited by the experiments that assume this account, and then explains why the Thomist
tradition’s notion of free will does not have those internal problems but can explain the
source of those internal difficulties in the rival tradition.3
2. The Libet-Style Experiments on the Neuroscience of Voluntary Action
Since Galen physiologists have known that the nervous system plays an essential role
in muscular contractions, including voluntary movements, that is, the bodily movements
we exercise some control over. Our understanding of what the nervous system is and how
it functions has been radically transformed over the centuries (Bennett and Hacker 2022,
Part 1, chp. 1–2), but a basic question seems to remain the same: what happens when I
voluntarily move my finger?
Discoveries in neurophysiology in the last century prompted neuroscientists like Sir
John Eccles and Benjamin Libet to ask and conceptualize these questions in light of the
dominant conceptions of free will and voluntary action of the 1970s–1980s. Neurophysiological studies in the 1960s had shown that activity in the motor cortex of the brain—which
can cause muscle movements, say, in a finger—can be detected prior to movement in a
finger; this detectable activity in the brain was dubbed the “readiness potential” (RP). This
experimental discovery of how to detect activity in the motor cortex of the brain prior to
detecting the muscle contractions it causes in a finger might not seem too impressive. After
all, it is reasonable to assume that events in the brain occur prior to the finger movements
they cause. But Libet, following the research of Eccles and others, used this experimental
discovery to ask more specific questions. When I voluntarily move my finger what happens
first: Does my conscious intention to move my finger occur before the activity in my brain
that causes the finger movement? Or, does the brain activity that causes my finger to
move occur before my “conscious awareness of the voluntary urge or intention to act”?
(Libet et al. 1983) Libet hypothesized, “If a conscious intention or decision to act actually
initiates a voluntary event, then the subjective experience of this intention should precede
or at least coincide with the onset of the specific cerebral processes that mediate the act”
(Libet 1985, p. 529). How can this question about the priority or coincidence of either
conscious intentions or neural events be “operationalized”; that is, how can this concept
of conscious-will be translated into a measurable empirical task that can then be tested
experimentally?
Given the conception of voluntary movement assumed and employed by Libet, the
experiment he devised is quite ingenious. In order to test his hypothesis Libet needed to
find some way to detect objectively (a) the time of the subjective experience of the “first
awareness of the urge to move” (Libet et al. 1983, p. 624) so as to distinguish it from (b)
the time of the RP in the brain detected by an electroencephalograph (EEG) and (c) the
time of a muscle burst in the relevant muscle (e.g., in the right forearm) recorded by an
electromyogram (EMG). This was achieved by instructing the subjects of the experiment
to watch the “clock-position” of a revolving spot and report the position of the spot at
the moment they became aware of the urge or intention to move. This reported time on
the “Libet Clock” provided an objective time for (a) the conscious volition that could be
compared with the times detected by the (b) EEG and the (c) EMG.
To understand Libet’s experiment better, it is helpful to imagine sitting in a room
watching the rapid revolutions of a spot on the “Libet Clock” with an EEG cap on your
head and an EMG attached to your forearm. Libet provided the following instructions for
“self-initiated voluntary acts”:

Religions 2024, 15, 662

3 of 21

“The subject was asked to wait for one complete revolution of the CRO spot [on
the so-called “Libet Clock”] and then, at any time thereafter when he felt like
doing so, to perform the quick, abrupt flexion of the fingers and/or the wrist of
his right hand. . .. An additional instruction to encourage ‘spontaneity’ of the act
was given routinely. . .. For this, the subject was instructed ‘to let the urge to act
appear on its own at any time without any preplanning or concentration on when
to act’, that is, to try to be ‘spontaneous’ in deciding when to perform each act;
this instruction was designed to elicit voluntary acts that were freely capricious
in origin”. (Libet et al. 1983, p. 625; my emphasis)
While watching the spot on the Libet Clock, subjects were told not to plan when
to move their finger, but to wait and move their finger after an “appearance of [their]
conscious awareness of ‘wanting’ to perform a given self-initiated movement” (Libet et al.
1983, p. 627). The subjects then reported the time on the Libet Clock corresponding to when
they were conscious of their voluntary urge or intention to move.
Libet’s experiment revealed that the RP in the brain was consistently detected some
550 milliseconds prior to the muscle flexion and around 350 milliseconds prior to “the
appearance of a reportable time for awareness of any subjective intention or wish to act”
(Libet et al. 1983, p. 640). In other words, the relevant activity in the brain consistently
occurred prior to any awareness of an intention to move. Libet concluded from these results:
“it would appear that some neuronal activity associated with the eventual performance of the act has started well before any (recallable) conscious initiation or
intervention could be possible. Put another way, the brain evidently ‘decides’ to
initiate or, at the least, prepare to initiate the act at a time before there is any reportable subjective awareness that such a decision has taken place. It is concluded
that cerebral initiation even of a spontaneous voluntary act, of the kind studied
here, can and usually does begin unconsciously”. (Libet et al. 1983, p. 640)
According to Libet, it is the brain that generates and initiates the voluntary movements
for us to perform. We then become conscious of these cerebrally proposed bodily movements, and our conscious free will is able to allow them, or, as Libet also noted, subjects
were able to veto the occurrence of these bodily movements.
“The role of conscious free will would be, then, not to initiate a voluntary act,
but rather to control whether the act takes place. We may view the unconscious
initiatives for voluntary actions as ‘bubbling up’ in the brain. The conscious-will
then selects which of these initiatives may go forward to an action or which ones
to veto and abort, with no act appearing”. (Libet 1999, p. 54)
A number of scientists and neurophilosophers have taken these and subsequent Libetstyle experiments to demonstrate humans do not have free will. The pioneering cognitive
neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga declares, “Neuroscience reveals that the concept of free
will is without meaning” (Gazzaniga 2012, 2014, chp. 4 “Abandoning the Concept of Free
Will”). Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen state, “Free will, as we ordinarily understand
it, is an illusion” (Greene and Cohen 2004, p. 1783). And the social psychologist Daniel
Wegner commenced his extensive study, The Illusion of Conscious Will, with his central
contention: “It usually seems that we consciously will our voluntary actions, but this is
an illusion” (Wegner 2002, p. 1). The biologist Jerry Coyne, like Robert Sapolsky, claims
these and other experiments reveal that “What is seriously affected is our idea of moral
responsibility, which should be discarded along with the idea of free will” (Coyne 2012;
Sapolsky 2023).
While these radical claims are primarily based upon the assumed implications of
Libet’s experiments, Libet himself was considerably more cautious. Libet concluded
his famous 1983 study with some important caveats which have been ignored by many
scientists and neurophilosophers skeptical of free will.

Religions 2024, 15, 662

“[A]ccepting our conclusion that spontaneous voluntary acts can be initiated
unconsciously, there would remain at least two types of conditions in which conscious control could be operative. (1) There could be a conscious ‘veto’ that aborts
the performance even of the type of ‘spontaneous’ self-initiated act under study
here. . . . (2) In those voluntary actions that are not ‘spontaneous’ and quickly
performed, that is, in those in which conscious deliberation (of whether to act or
of what alternative choice of action to take) precedes the act, the possibilities for
conscious initiation and control would not be excluded by the present evidence”.
(Libet et al. 1983, p. 641)
In light of these caveats, some have understood Libet’s view of conscious-will to imply
that while we do not have free will, we do have free won’t. But Libet also emphasizes here
that his study only addressed “actions” that were (i) spontaneous, (ii) unplanned, (iii) motor
movements. What his experiments do not address are either planned or non-motor actions,
that is, the kinds of psychological phenomena many plain persons and philosophers alike
understand to be paradigmatic of voluntary human “actions”. Furthermore, many have
rightly pointed out that Libet’s experiments on spontaneous unplanned motor movements
only pertain to arbitrary “picking” and not “choosing” for some reason, where “choosing”
is what matters when it comes to debates about moral responsibility and free will.4
In the four decades since Libet et al.’s 1983 study, new Libet-style experiments—often
drawing upon innovations in neuroscience technology—have emerged which attempt to
overcome some of the legitimate technical deficiencies of Libet’s experiments (e.g., problems
with subjective reporting times; statistical errors), some of the philosophical criticisms of
Libet’s experiments (e.g., that choosing, not picking, is crucial to free will), as well as
some of their limitations of scope (e.g., not testing the neural antecedents of free won’t
or of non-motor actions).5 For instance, Patrick Haggard and colleagues have conducted
Libet-style experiments to challenge Libet’s claim that we can initiate a conscious veto
or free won’t (see Filevich et al. 2013; Brass and Haggard 2007; Haggard 2019; SchultzeKraft et al. 2016). John-Dylan Hanes and colleagues performed experiments wherein they
identified brain activity up to 10 seconds prior to conscious awareness of an urge to press
either a right or left button that is predictive of which button will be pushed (Soon et al.
2008).6 In another experiment, John-Dylan Hanes and colleagues discovered antecedent
neural activity for non-motor actions, which they claim “show[s] that the outcome of
a free decision to either add or subtract numbers can already be decoded from neural
activity in medial prefrontal and parietal cortex 4 s before the participant reports they are
consciously making their choice” (Soon et al. 2013). Many neuroscientists are confident that
as neuroscience technology improves, so also will their ability to detect antecedent neural
activity that is predictive, and perhaps even determinative, of our conscious urges to act.
The main challenge these Libet-style experiments purportedly present to Thomism
is the thesis that all our conscious intentions and decisions are determined by the brain
before we become conscious of our intentions or decisions. My counterargument to this
challenge is as follows. Neuroscientific experiments addressing the reality or nature of
free will necessarily operationalize some conception of free will, and so the scope and
adequacy of the results of these experiments are essentially dependent upon the scope and
adequacy of the conception of free will employed in these experiments. Most positive and
critical responses to the Libet-style experiments by both neuroscientists and philosophers
implicitly assume or overtly endorse the same conceptions of free will and voluntary action
operationalized in these experiments.7 But these very conceptions of free will and voluntary
action are incompatible with the account of Thomas Aquinas which is defended by the
Thomist tradition. Accordingly, if Thomists have sufficient justification for defending
their account of voluntary action and free will and rejecting these rival philosophical
conceptions, then they have prior and independent philosophical grounds for rejecting
the rival tradition’s conceptions of voluntary action assumed and operationalized within
Libet-style experiments along with their free-will-skeptical interpretations. The rest of

Religions 2024, 15, 662

this essay is dedicated to making the case for this counterargument and presenting an
alternative Thomist interpretation of the Libet-style experiments.
3. Four Problems for the Causal Theory of Action
Thomists are not alone in critiquing what is known as the “causal theory of action”,
that is, the philosophical conception of voluntary action that is uncritically assumed and
operationalized in all Libet-style experiments. Thomism and the philosophical tradition
which endorses the causal theory of action both take their theories of action to be accountable to the everyday lives of plain persons. But they disagree about how to conceptualize
everyday human actions, and it is these disagreements that generate different internal
problems for these rival philosophical traditions. Let us consider the causal theory of
human action and the major internal problems critics raise against it.
The standard causal theories of action are committed to a Humean picture of causation
wherein causes are events that are temporally prior to their effects and there are no logical
connections among causes and effects. So, when it comes to action, they contend what
distinguishes voluntary actions from mere bodily movements are their distinctive kinds
of antecedent mental causes. An action is caused by a prior mental event that has been
variously characterized as being a (conscious or unconscious) volition, willing, sensation,
impression, idea, intention, or kinesthetic image by Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Reid,
Mill, William James, Bertrand Russell, and others.8 Given the prominence of this causal
picture of action, and the mistaken assumption that it is a matter of commonsense, it is
not surprising that Libet and colleagues conceptualized their enquiries in these terms
and focused their attention on conscious antecedents of voluntary movements. Most
modern theories of the will do contend that a “specific kind of conscious thought was
held to cause every voluntary act” (Hyman 2015, p. 4). It is the presence of this conscious
executive mental cause that distinguishes “actions” from mere bodily movements. These
anti-Aristotelian and predominantly Humean conceptions of action and the will were
vigorously critiqued by Wittgenstein, Ryle, Anscombe, and many others. The causal theory
re-emerged later, however, in a different guise in Donald Davidson, no longer as a theory
of will, but as an account of intentions as rationalizing mental causes of actions.9 Variations
on Davidson’s view have come to be known as the “standard story” or “causal theory” in
the philosophy of action (see Davidson 2001, pp. 3–20; Teichmann 2015, p. 142; Stoutland
2011; Vogler 2016).
It is unlikely Davidson’s view had any direct influence on Libet. Libet did, however,
frequently interact with John Eccles, and Eccles’ own musings on the self and its myriad
liaisons with the brain led to collaborations with Karl Popper. Eccles and Popper defended
a form of interactionist dualism and articulated a version of the causal theory of voluntary
action. The influence of Eccles on Libet for the initial conceptual framing of the neuroscientific experiments on free will is unquestionable. I suspect both of their conceptions of
voluntary action and free will, like those of most neuroscientists then and now, were due
more to a general picture which still holds many captive, a picture that is made theoretically
explicit by the causal theory (Eccles and Popper 1977).10 What are the internal philosophical
problems with the causal theory?
Harry Frankfurt drew attention to one of the fatal flaws in the causal theory of action—
namely, it misrepresents action itself, that is, the very explanandum it aims to explain. This is
because the causal theory of action entails there is no intrinsic difference between actions
and mere happenings. Actions, it holds, are caused by some executive mental cause (e.g.,
volition, intention, etc.), and mere happenings have other causes, but the effects that result
from these two different types of causal histories are “inherently indistinguishable”.
“It is integral to the causal approach to regard actions and mere happenings as
being differentiated by nothing that exists or that is going on at the time those
events occur, but by something quite extrinsic to them—a difference at an earlier
time among another set of events entirely. This is what makes causal theories
implausible”. (Frankfurt 1978, p. 157)

Religions 2024, 15, 662

Paradigmatic human actions, pace the causal theory, exhibit ongoing purposive rational control within a dynamic environment, like each of the basketball players on a
team shifting to offense and intelligently responding in coordinated ways to the defensive
strategy of their opponents; an investigative journalist tactfully interrogating an evasive
minister suspected of fraud during a live interview; or a surgeon cautiously reacting to
unanticipated hemorrhaging complications mid-surgery. These and more everyday actions
like driving during rush hour or conversing with a friend involve the continuous efficacious
guidance of practical intelligence; actions are not captured by the slogan: set it and forget it.
Frankfurt argues that the causal theory cannot integrate these putative characteristics
of human action within its account because the “only conditions they insist upon as
distinctively constitutive of action may cease to obtain, for all the causal accounts demand,
at precisely the moment when the agent commences to act. They require nothing of an
agent, once the specified causal antecedents of his performing an action have occurred,
except that his body move as their effect” (Frankfurt 1978, p. 157). Furthermore, it is
precisely this problematic conception of action—along with these Humean commitments
and omissions of obvious action characteristics—that render all causal theories vulnerable
to a second problem, that of deviant causal chains. Consider the following scenario.
Jones is a neuroscience enthusiast and is dead chuffed when he is chosen to be a
volunteer participant in a Libet-style experiment. Not risking anything to chance, he
makes plans to ensure he arrives early at the neuroscience laboratory on the big day. Once
he arrives, he dutifully listens carefully to the instructions of the scientist running the
experiment: he is told to watch the revolving spot on the Libet Clock and to push a button
and note the “time” on the Libet Clock whenever he becomes conscious of an urge or
intention or volition to push the button.11 As the scientists attach some apparatuses to
his head and forearm, he feels a surge of excitement, and his heart begins to race. The
scientists start the clock and leave the room. Jones stares at the clock and waits patiently in
anticipation for a conscious urge to push the button, but nothing happens. After a long time,
Jones begins to grow anxious and thinks to himself, “Maybe I’m doing something wrong”.
He rehearses the instructions to himself to make sure he is following them correctly, but
still, nothing happens. Jones begins to tremble with frustration when, all of a sudden, he
becomes conscious of what he had been instructed to interpret as an urge or volition to
push the button, but the dawning of this spontaneous feeling startles Jones so much that it
causes his finger to move, and it depresses the button.
Even though very few would insist Jones here performed an action of intentionally
pushing a button, the causal theory is forced to characterize his bodily movements as an
action because what transpired satisfies the causal theory’s conditions for an “action”. Such
episodes are characterized as deviant causal chains because despite the presence of the
right sort of prior executive mental cause—the urge or volition to push the button—Jones’s
awareness of his volition or intention startled him, causing his trembling finger to push
the button. The button was pushed due to Jones being startled, and not directly due to his
volition or intention to push the button. As Frankfurt and others have argued, and as the
causal theory’s major exponents like Davidson have acknowledged, the difficulty is that
“No matter what kinds of causal antecedents are designated as necessary and sufficient
for the occurrence of an action, it is easy to show that causal antecedents of that kind may
have as their effect an event that is manifestly not an action but a mere bodily movement”
(Frankfurt 1978, p. 157). The causal theory of action “must inevitably leave open the
possibility that a person, whatever his involvement in the events from which his action
arises, loses all connection with the movements of his body at the moment when his action
begins” (Frankfurt 1978, p. 158).
Along with this second problem with deviant causal chains, two additional problems
with the causal theory are relevant to the Libet-style experiments. The third problem is
whether voluntary actions require either a conscious volition or a spelt-out deliberation
of what one is going to do prior to causing that action. The most sophisticated causal
theorists might (rightly) doubt that what Jones experienced is aptly described as a volition

Religions 2024, 15, 662

7 of 21

or intention; nevertheless, many philosophers and neuroscientists subscribing to the causal
theory are fully committed to the thesis that a prior sense of agency, feeling of volition, or
awareness of one’s intention is a conditio sine qua non for all voluntary actions. I will return
to this.
A fourth problem concerns how anyone can identify actions if the causal theory is true.
This problem also brings to light why exponents of the causal theory must be committed to
the third problematic thesis, namely, that actions require that persons consciously experience
an intention or volition to act prior to it causing their actions. If actions and mere bodily
events are inherently indistinguishable, as the first problem of the causal theory discloses,
then the only way to distinguish events that are actions from mere bodily movements
requires identifying the effects which have the right sort of causal antecedents, namely,
intentions or volitions. However, because there is nothing that intrinsically distinguishes
Jones’s actions from his mere bodily movements, third-person observers cannot detect
whether another person, like Jones, is performing an action or his bodily movement is
due to being startled. The causal theory entails the only person who can identify these
unobservable mental causes of action is the person who consciously experiences these
mental events. Absent any prior conscious experience of his own intentions or volitions, not
even Jones can discern whether or not the events that issue forth as his bodily movements
are actions.
Later, I address how some of these internal problems with causal theories of action
infect the Libet-style experiments which assume the causal theory of action. I turn now to
the alternative conception of action defended by Thomists and show how it avoids these
problems confronting the causal theory of action, in part by providing a more adequate
account of the complexities of everyday human living.
4. Aquinas, Thomists, and Action
The battery of distinctions and arguments concerning human action and free will
afforded by the thought of Thomas Aquinas and his commentators contains many valuable
insights for thinking through the practical and theoretical questions that confront us today
(see Brock 1998; Osborne 2014; Pilsner 2006; Westberg 1994; MacIntyre 1989, 2008; McInerny
1992; De Haan 2021, 2022a, 2022b). Here, I focus on the features of a Thomist account
of human action that are most relevant to the causal theory of action assumed by the
Libet-style experiments.
4.1. A Thomist Account of Human Action
Unlike many contemporary philosophers, Aquinas presents an integrated account of
ethics, human action, virtue, and free will. While some might argue that the philosophy
of action is orthogonal to the problem of free will (and vice versa), Aquinas maintains the
Aristotelian principle that the objects and operations pertaining to human action disclose
the kinds of powers that ground these operations. In other words, we only come to discover
and understand the nature of our powers of reason and will through an understanding
of our experiences as developing social animals that engage in practical reasoning and
voluntary acting. Thomists therefore will not find it alarming that debates orbiting the
Libet-style experiments frequently shift from the subject of voluntary action to free will, as
they are inextricably connected.
Aquinas’s treatment of human action follows his account of the ends pursued by
acting. He commences with a distinction between “human actions” (actiones humanae) and
“acts of a human” (hominis actiones) (Aquinas 1981, ST I–II.1.1).12 The latter pertains to
acts performed by humans and other animals; the former signifies acts that are proper
to human persons and so distinguish them from the acts of nonhuman animals. Human
actions are identified with those acts that humans rationally control; that is, actions require
an ability to exercise rational self-mastery or self-determination over what one does or
does not do. To be clear, the “self” in “self-determination” is neither any power of the
soul, nor the soul itself, nor an inner mind (mens); “self” here simply means the developing

Religions 2024, 15, 662

8 of 21

dependent rational animal, that is, the whole human person (see Aristotle 1981, De Anima,
I.4.408b12–15; Bennett and Hacker 2022, chp. 3–4; MacIntyre 2006c, pp. 86–103). It is our
exercise of practical reasoning and willing that constitutes our rational self-control over
what we do. What explains and grounds this confluent exercise of practical reasoning and
willing are the powers of reason and will. We know what the power of will or free will is
through what it enables us to do, namely, exercise voluntary human actions.
Human actions proceed from a deliberate willing (ex voluntate deliberata procedunt),
wherein the confluence of our rationally intentional and voluntary operations and powers
is crucial. Indeed, Aquinas eschews false dichotomies and captivating, though distorting,
philosophical pictures—e.g., intellectualism versus voluntarism—by identifying free choice
(liberum arbitrium) as a capacity (facultas) requiring practical reason and will. Neither rational
cognition nor volitional appetition alone is sufficient for a free judgment or free action
(see Aquinas 1952–1954, Truth, 24.4–6; 1981, ST I.83.2–4; 2003, De malo, 6). To understand
free choice properly involves resisting any theoretical analysis that requires reducing free
human action to a single explanatory primitive like reason alone or will alone. At those
atomic levels of theoretical analysis, free human action—the explanandum—disappears. For
Aquinas, the voluntary operations of the will are always teleologically specified by the
presentations of practical reason, and the evaluations of practical reason require the efficacy
of the will in order to execute a human action (see Aquinas 1952–1954, Truth, 24.6 ad 1 et ad
5; 1981, ST I–II.9.1 (esp. ad3); 9.3 ad3; Westberg 1994, chp. 4–8). There can be no free choice
apart from the co-operative exercise of practical reason and will.
This brings us to the way Aquinas helps us to distinguish voluntary actions from
involuntary and nonvoluntary behaviors. We exhibit fully voluntary actions insofar as we
exercise rational control over the initiation, continuation, and termination of our actions.13
Voluntary action pertains principally to the “domain of things able to be in a human’s power
to do or to bring about”, but it also includes both omissions as well as “the possibility of
suffering or undergoing things voluntarily” (Brock 1998, p. 138; see also pp. 155–60). This is
why Aquinas counts some omissions or instances of “not acting” among voluntary actions,
like permitting, abstaining, refraining, allowing, and tolerating. Aquinas also distinguishes
these voluntary acts of omission from what Stephen Brock calls “voluntary passions”
and John Hyman labels “voluntary passivity” as distinct from “voluntary inactivity” (see
Aquinas 1981, ST I–II.6.5; Brock 1998, p. 150; Hyman 2015, pp. 9–11). In his Action,
Knowledge, and Will, Hyman reiterates how few philosophers of action have taken any
notice of voluntary passions, and he singles out Aquinas and Anscombe as important
exceptions. I can voluntarily permit some event to occur, but I can also voluntarily undergo
some passion, and in both cases I can be held responsible and either be culpable for some
wrong that I allowed to happen or willingly suffered, or merit some good that I did not
attempt to thwart or that I elected to suffer. Involuntary acts are any acts that occur that are
contrary to the voluntary stances or efforts of the person. Unlike voluntary and involuntary
actions, nonvoluntary acts fall outside of the domain of acts that humans have the selfdetermining ability to do or to refrain from doing; they are mere acts of a human (McInerny
1992, pp. 1–24).
To be clear: what happens to a person insofar as it is a passion is among the nonvoluntary acts of a human; however, that person might voluntarily intend and choose to undergo
some passion, in which case it is the way that person undergoes some passion that renders
some aspects of it as being a voluntary passion. Despite my irrational fear of needles, I
voluntarily allow a nurse to take my blood and give me injections. But many voluntary
passions are considerably less dramatic; we allow others to cut our hair, to treat us to
dinner, “and both children and adults sometimes choose whether or not to be kissed or
carried, just as they sometimes choose whether to kiss or carry someone or something
else” (Hyman 2015, p. 11). However, if in any of these cases a person voluntarily attempts
to resist undergoing such passions as getting a haircut, receiving an injection, or being
frog-marched, and insofar as this person is forced or compelled to continue enduring such

Religions 2024, 15, 662

9 of 21

passions despite their continued voluntary efforts to the contrary, the passions that happen
to them fall within the domain of the involuntary.
In sum, whatever happens to a human person, insofar as it is a passive undergoing, is a
nonvoluntary act of a human, but insofar as he voluntarily endures it—as many, but not all,
martyrs have done—it is a voluntary passion and qua voluntary is a human action (Aquinas
1981, ST II–II.123.6; II–II.124.4ad4). Insofar as it lies within someone’s control to voluntarily
oppose such passions, happenings that thwart or coerce the person contrary to his voluntary
efforts are, in this respect, identified with involuntary behavior. Hence, what happens to
a human person does not of itself discriminate among the voluntary, involuntary, and
nonvoluntary, for happenings admit coarse-grained and more fine-grained descriptions.
There is much more to be said about Thomist accounts of human action, but this
should be sufficient for addressing why Thomists reject the causal theory of action and
thereby steer clear of the problems introduced above. The significance of these Thomist
distinctions will become apparent when we present a Thomist reinterpretation of the
Libet-style experiments in the final section.
4.2. Do Thomists Face the Same Problems the Causal Theorists Do?
First, the problem of deviant causal chains that plagues the causal theory of action
does not arise for Aquinas or Thomists who reject the Humean conception of causation
that renders causes logically isolated from and temporally prior to their effects. Aquinas is
committed to an Aristotelian conception of causation wherein the operations of practical
reasoning and willing function as confluent efficient, formal, and final causes. Together
they actualize, coordinate the actualization of, and rationally guide or direct the other
human powers for perception, memory, conation, and motility, which have potencies to
be actualized, coordinated in their operations, and directed by practical reasoning and
willing. To be far too brief, the human’s embodied perceptions and movements have the
intrinsic potentiality to be passions actualized by the “interior action” of the will informed by
practical reason. Causal action and effected passion here are neither temporally successive
nor logically contingent, but dynamically constitutive of the acting human, that is, of what
the human is doing by intentionally acting.14 This neo-Aristotelian view should not be
confused with any version of psychophysical identity theory, as the “relation between the
movements. . . and the action itself is not one of identity but composition” (Haldane 2003,
pp. 97–98).
What I just characterized in terms of the passions of other powers actualized by the
action of the will informed by practical reason is what Aquinas in his discussion on the
moral species of human action analyzes in terms of two explanantia: interior action and
exterior action. The interior action of the will formally actualizes the exterior actions of the
other powers, like those for embodied perception, motivation, and motility. Once again,
this is a constitutive or hylomorphic compositional relation between the interior action
as formal and principal cause and exterior actions as material and instrumental causes.
Together, these two explanantia comprise what Aquinas calls a voluntary human action, the
explanandum. Because exterior actions are formally specified by interior actions, Aquinas
holds that if the interior act changes, so too does the exterior act. If I am going to church in
order to give ostentatiously an enormous tithe but along the way become contrite for my
vainglorious intention and now intend to go to church to repent, then the exterior act has
also changed. I am no longer “going to church to boast”. I am now “going to church to
repent”.15 In other words, Aquinas is committed to a form of disjunctivism with respect to
human action.
It is for this reason that Aquinas’s account of human action avoids the first, second,
and fourth problems that confute the causal theory. For Aquinas, human actions are
intrinsically different from other acts of humans or any mere bodily movements that are not
human actions. Human actions are constituted by the formality of the interior acts, whereas
non-actions (or other acts of humans) are constituted by a different formality (e.g., reflexes
or instinct). The button being pushed as a result of Jones being startled is a completely

Religions 2024, 15, 662

10 of 21

different act of a human from any human action Jones might perform like leaving for work
early, following the scientist’s instructions, or voluntarily pushing the button. More would
need to be said to show why Aquinas’s or other disjunctivist accounts of action avoid every
possible version of the deviant causal chains problem, but this should suffice to show why
it does not face the arguably fatal objection deviant causal chains pose to the causal theory.
As for the fourth problem of identifying human actions, two points are noteworthy.
First, as we have just seen, unlike the causal theory, Thomists maintain that human actions
are inherently different from non-actions. Furthermore, Thomists, like Gibsonians, some
phenomenologists, and radical enactive cognition theorists, endorse a richer conception of
what is observable, like affordances, and what can be observed than most modern theories
of perception (see MacIntyre 2006a, chp. 9; 2006c; Haldane 1988; Zahavi 2014, chp. 11;
Hacker 2017, chp. 12; Gibson 1966; Hutto and Myin 2013; Hutto 2007). “The affordances
of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for
good or ill” (Gibson 1979, p. 127). Our environment is replete with observable affordances,
including the psychologically animated comportment of other humans. Human actions
like signing a check, stealing a purse, hailing a cab, and eating one’s dinner are among
the many observable psychological phenomena that comprise human life. Most human
actions are observable to others even if they require interpretation and attunement to the
per accidens sensibles or more subtle affordances exhibited by the characters of different
persons in different circumstances.16 It is no objection to this realist position to point out
our observational mistakes, for, as MacIntyre explains, it is because human actions are
exhibited in and through interpretable human bodies that they are always liable to be being
misinterpreted human actions (MacIntyre 2006c, pp. 91–94).
Given these Thomist responses to the first, second, and fourth problems, we can see
that when it comes to the third problem, Thomists need not be committed to the causal
theorist’s thesis that all human actions require a prior conscious volition or intention.
Nevertheless, some might think there is experiential evidence that justifies this thesis
independently from the question of whether it is entailed by the causal theory of action.
After all, it is obvious that we do deliberate about what we are going to do before we do it,
and such prior deliberations seem to be necessary if we are to act intentionally. How else
might we act for reasons if we did not consciously deliberate and form a practical syllogism
that articulated our reasons for acting prior to acting on account of these reasons?
Some causal theories have taken this line of thinking to its extreme—not only in the
philosophy of action but also in their libertarian accounts of free will—concluding that
morally responsible free human actions are extremely rare.
“One way in which philosophical models tend to over-idealize has already been
remarked upon: given the pervasiveness of automaticity, the freedom and responsibility of much of what we do must be thought of as “inherited” from
the comparatively few directly free choices that we make. While some recent
philosophers have incorporated that fact into their thinking about the will, it is
still not widely enough appreciated, so that philosophers often write as if we are
constantly making explicit and considered choices”. (O’Connor 2009, p. 182)
This conclusion runs completely counter to Aquinas’s positions on the ubiquity of free
human actions in everyday life, that every human action is morally significant,17 and that
as we increase in virtue our enkratic oscillations and deliberative indecisions diminish; for
the virtuous, right human actions are stable, prompt, and enjoyable (see Aquinas 1952–1954,
Truth, 1.1; 1.8, ad6, ad7; 1.9ad13; 26.7ad3). Prudent persons not only deliberate well, but
also judiciously decide rightly which circumstances require deliberation prior to action and
which do not (see Aquinas 1981, ST II–II.49.4). So, how do we avoid this extreme conclusion
that free human actions are exceptionally rare while also recognizing the constitutive role
of practical reasoning in everyday human actions? How can we maintain that we are
responsible and culpable for all the lies we tell, not just the premeditated lies we schemed
up beforehand?

Religions 2024, 15, 662

We need to start by understanding the phenomenology of voluntary action correctly.
First, theories that contend all free actions require prior explicit and considered choices occlude what is distinctive among nonvoluntary habituation, nonvoluntary versus voluntary
forms of automaticity, routines, practices, virtuous activity, and embodied expertise among
athletes, musicians, craftsmen, technicians, and many others. Explicating such distinctions
goes beyond the aims of this essay, but such work has been conducted (see MacIntyre 1986,
pp. 63–80; 2007, chp. 15; McDowell 2007, chp. 18–19; Bennett and Hacker 2022), and what
is characteristic of voluntary action will suffice to show how superficial that theoretical
contention is.
Second, as John Haldane explains, “to understand what is going on is satisfied by being
told what the agent is doing. No mention of antecedent events is necessary” (Haldane 2003,
p. 101). My voluntary action of traveling to work—including all the obstacles I consciously
and intentionally navigate around to reach my office—does not require any antecedent
conscious articulation of what I am going to do before I do it. I might think to myself: “First,
I need to get to the bus stop in ten minutes, then I’ll board the bus and pay my fare, then
I’ll get off at my stop, then I’ll cross the street, etc.” before I go to work, but I need not think
through this, and consciously thinking it out beforehand does not render my going to work
“voluntary” or a “free choice”. The Thomist criteria for voluntary actions, like speaking, do
not require that I plan or deliberate about what to say before I say it. As Hacker incisively
points out, these erroneous theories have mistakenly
“presupposed that every voluntary human movement constituting an action is
preceded by an act or occurrence of willing. But there is no empirical reason for
supposing this to be true. We are not aware of performing an act of will (let alone
of an effort of will or an inner act of trying) or of the occurrence of a volition
(a mental image or a representation of a kinaesthetic sensation) antecedently
to everything we do voluntarily. When one utters a sentence, every word is
spoken voluntarily, but it would be ridiculous to claim that one consciously
performs successive acts of will, one for each word (or phoneme?) an instant
before utterance. And it would defeat the purpose of the account to suggest that
one performs this manifold, but without being conscious of doing so—for part of
the point of the account is precisely to explain, by reference to the transparency
of each mental act or occurrence of willing, how it is that we can distinguish,
without evidence, between what we voluntarily do and what happens to us.
This empirical qualm gives rise to deeper conceptual worries”. (Hacker 2007,
pp. 148–49)
Third, this phenomenologically implausible contention, namely, that all voluntary
actions must be presaged by an antecedent conscious or nonconscious deliberation, is
vulnerable to two nasty regresses. First, if I cannot voluntarily speak without previously
deliberating about what to say, then how can I voluntarily deliberate about “what to say”,
without previously voluntarily deliberating about whether I should “voluntarily deliberate
about ‘what to say’”, and so on?18 Second, this contention demands more than any human
form of explicit deliberation can or should deliver, for if we cannot act voluntarily without
complete prior deliberations, then what possible non-arbitrary limits are there on what
counts as a complete deliberation? Even in those more capacious moments of life where
we have all the time in the world to deliberate about our future actions, we can “never
consider every possible feature of any concrete option, a procedure that would be infinite,
or at the very least practically impossible” (Jensen 2017, p. 321).
What is required instead for a Thomist account of voluntary action is aptly captured
by meeting some criteria akin to Anscombe’s treatment of the question “Why?” relevant to
intentional action.
“What distinguishes actions that are intentional from those which are not? The
answer that I shall suggest is that they are the actions to which a certain sense of

Religions 2024, 15, 662

12 of 21

the question “Why?” is given application; the sense is of course that in which the
answer, if positive, gives a reason for acting”. (Anscombe 1972, § 9)19
Sincere and truthful answers to the relevant question “Why?” report the reasons for
action that the human person was in fact intentionally or voluntarily employing while
acting. Confabulated reasons for action after the fact either betray the absence of a voluntary
action or mask the true reasons for some action with a concocted or insincere avowal
(MacIntyre 2016, pp. 9–13). If we understand the Thomist criteria for perfect human action
in light of Anscombe’s account of the relevant question “Why?” then we can understand
why actions do not require antecedent conscious formulations of one’s reasons for action,
but rather the rational competency to act in such a way that one could articulate truthfully
the practical reasoning exhibited in one’s intentional acting (Brock 1998, pp. 103–6, 239).
There are two common misunderstandings of this account that need to be addressed
before we can move on to the challenges of the Libet-style experiments. First, it might seem
that practical reasoning on this Thomist–Anscombean account is so retrospective that it
entails we do not know what we are doing until after we have voluntarily done it. Second,
it might seem to imply that we never need to deliberate before we perform an action, which
is surely false. Neither of these two problematic results follow from this account of practical
reasoning and intentional action.
To the first worry, voluntary action consists in a kind of conscious, non-observational,
practical knowledge productive of action (Anscombe 1972, §§ 8–9; pp. 16, 28–29, 33ff). As
was noted before, intentional acting takes place on the go and requires practical intelligence
that is flexible and adaptive to whatever the particular circumstances of life throw at
us. Sometimes we need to intentionally react immediately to unforeseen circumstances
when we encounter someone in grave danger or meet questions and assertions that need
answers or rebuttals, and which, because of their immediacy, exclude the possibility of any
worked-out deliberation prior to intentionally acting, including speaking.
As for the second worry, MacIntyre explains:
“Indeed, what matters about rational action is primarily, not that we have deliberated immediately before embarking upon any particular action through the
enunciation of some practical syllogism, but that we should act as someone would
have done who had so deliberated and that we should be able to answer truly the
question “Why did you so act?” by citing the relevant practical syllogism and the
relevant piece of deliberation, even if these had not actually been rehearsed by us
on this particular occasion. But of course in order for this to be the case, it will
also have to be the case that often enough we have deliberated explicitly and so
performed the tasks necessary for constructing a practical syllogism”. (MacIntyre
1989, p. 131; see also pp. 138–39)
Articulated practical syllogisms—whether deliberated beforehand or retrospectively
reflected upon afterward—set in relief the practical reasoning that will be or was logically
governing and constituting one’s embodied intentional actions. We thematize in speech
what will be or was actualized in rationally controlled embodied human actions. However,
our free human actions performed without prior deliberations are in themselves voluntary
and intentional; they do not derive or “inherit” their freedom from any past or future
instances of explicit practical reasoning. Self-examination and social correction, especially
via the counsel of family and friends, are not required before or after every instance of a
voluntary action to certify that it is a bona fide voluntary action. Nevertheless, as MacIntyre
argues, explicit self and social deliberations are indispensable for developing and perfecting
our rational and volitional abilities to pursue various ends via various means, to anticipate,
prevent, or resolve conflicting ends pursued (like God, family, friends, or work), and to
rank-order as well as harmonize the ends we pursue at any particular point or throughout
our lives as developing rational animals (MacIntyre 1999; 2014, pp. 807–21). In short, there
are three ways practical reasoning is exercised and manifested in our intentional actions as
developing human persons: (i) explicitly in our self and social deliberations prior to acting,

Religions 2024, 15, 662

13 of 21

(ii) as tacitly exhibited in our conscious and rationally controlled intentional acting in the
present, and (iii) explicitly in our retrospective self and social examinations of stories told
about our conduct.
A proper exposition, argumentative comparison, and defense of this Thomist account
of action vis-à-vis causal theories of action would require an extended enquiry.20 What
this brief presentation of the Thomist account reveals is a rival conception of human
action to that propounded by causal theorists, an alternative which explains human action
without needing or conceding the thesis that human action requires an antecedent conscious
mental cause.
5. A Thomist Reinterpretation of the Libet-Style Experiments on Voluntary Action
Even this brief sketch of a Thomist conception of human action and free will—which
omits many key distinctions and details—is sufficient to lay bare some of the fundamental
disagreements between these rival conceptions of human action and free will. Significantly,
these conceptual disagreements about human action are prior to and inform how rival
theorists interpret and evaluate the neuroscientific experiments on free will that operationalize a particular philosophical conception of voluntary action. All Libet-style experiments
subscribe to at least two theses central to the causal theory of action, both of which are
rejected by the Thomist account presented here: first, that actions are caused by a prior
volition or intention; and second, that persons are conscious of their volition or intention to
act prior to acting. Without these two theses from the causal theory, Libet’s experiments
would be unintelligible. This is because the principal reason for introducing the Libet Clock
to establish the objective time at which a subject is conscious of his intention to act was to
achieve an experimental operationalization of the causal theory’s conception of a conscious
volition that is prior to the action it causes. And because the results of these experiments
rely on the operationalization of one of these rival conceptions of voluntary action and
free will, it is quite plausible that a radically different conception of voluntary action and
free will would provide a radical alternative interpretation of the Libet-style experiments.
Given the differences we have already established between Thomists’ and causal theorists’
conceptions of action, it will be instructive to show how Thomists should re-interpret the
Libet-style experiments. This Thomist re-interpretation will reveal why these experiments
do not present any challenge to voluntary action or free will as conceptualized by those
committed to the Thomist account.
The first problem with the Libet-style experiments is that Libet indiscriminately employs a wide range of psychological terms throughout his work to identify and characterize
voluntary action, like conscious urges or volitions, as well as subjective experiences of
intentions, decisions, desires, and wishes. Libet employed this array of psychological terms
to avoid endorsing a specific philosophical view about voluntary action. He writes that
“the voluntary action studied was defined operationally, including appropriate and reliable
reports of introspective experiences. The definition is not committed to or dependent upon
any specific philosophical view of the mind-brain relationship” (Libet 1985, p. 530, my
emphasis). The problem is that philosophical neutrality on any contentious issue is difficult
if not impossible to achieve. By failing to distinguish conscious urges and desires from
intentions and decisions, Libet’s experiments thereby implicitly adopt a conception of
voluntary action that elides any significant conceptual (and so potentially experimental)
differences that might exist among these psychological phenomena. For instance, he employs numerous psychological concepts and descriptions to characterize voluntary actions
without apparently noticing the tension between (a) descriptions of voluntary action as
something active, self-initiated, and freely controlled and (b) descriptions of voluntary
action as a phenomenon that involves capriciously felt urges or inclinations to act that
“appeared spontaneously (“out of nowhere”)”.21 He seems to regard urges, wishes, inclinations, desires, intentions, and decisions alike as consciously experienced antecedents
that are “paradigmatic examples of unrestricted volition, at least in regard to choosing
when to act” (Libet 1985, p. 532). This pageant of incompatible descriptions of voluntary

Religions 2024, 15, 662

actions is deeply problematic from a Thomist point of view because it means that Libet-style
experiments do not notice any discernable difference among the psychological phenomena
Aquinas regards as acts of a human as distinct from those he identifies with human actions.
In order to discern what bearing Libet’s experiments have on Thomist accounts of
human action, we first need to get a grip on what psychological phenomenon Libet is
in fact targeting despite his ambivalent psychological descriptions. We can obtain some
traction here by turning our attention once again to the disagreement over the need for
conscious experiences of urges or intentions antecedent to voluntary actions. Like other
exponents of the causal theory of action, Libet maintains that intentions, decisions, urges,
or wishes are paradigmatically something one experiences or becomes conscious of prior
to one’s voluntary motor actions. Indeed, the presence of such antecedent, conscious,
psychological phenomena provides the telltale mark of a voluntary action for all Libet-style
experiments. Such “introspective experiences” are included in his operationalized definition
of voluntary action.
“The subject is also instructed to allow each such act to arise “spontaneously”,
without deliberately planning or paying attention to the “prospect” of acting in
advance. The subjects did indeed report that the inclination for each act appeared
spontaneously (“out of nowhere”), that they were consciously aware of their urge
or decision to act before each act, that they felt in conscious control of whether or
not to act, and that they felt no external or psychological pressures that affected
the time when they decided to act”. (Libet 1985, p. 530)
In order to determine the timing of the subject’s conscious-willing, Libet’s experiment
required that subjects become conscious of their spontaneous and non-pre-planned urges
or decisions to act prior to their motor acts. As was underscored before, without these
subjective experiences of prior inclinations, urges, or decisions to move, there would be
nothing for the subject to time and report, and so no conscious-will to compare with
the EEG and EMG. While Patrick Haggard and other neuroscientists have more recently
introduced numerous rectifications and improvements to the original Libet experiments,
this feature has been accentuated. Haggard has rendered the search for the neural source
of our sense of agency central to his own Libet-style experiments on free will. According to
Haggard and Bonicalzi:
“Intentional actions are accompanied by a distinctive sense of agency, whose
presence is seen as necessary for somebody to qualify as an agent and not just
as a physical cause of an outcome (Gallagher 2007). The sense of agency accompanying intentional actions has been defined as the sense of being in control of
our actions and, through them, of their consequences in the outside world. . .”.
(Bonicalzi and Haggard 2019, p. 2; see also pp. 11–12; Haggard 2019, p. 22)
This point is significant, for it brings to light that even the more recent modified Libetstyle experiments continue to focus on operationalized definitions of action that regard as
paradigmatic what we were at pains to show is rejected by Thomists, namely, that prior to
the movements of a voluntary action a subject has a “subjective experience” or “conscious
awareness of the voluntary urge or intention to act” (Libet et al. 1983, p. 624).
For Thomists, human actions do not require any antecedent awareness of a conscious
urge, wanting, intention, or decision to cause our actions and make them voluntary or
intentional. In order to raise my arm voluntarily, this action need not be—indeed it
rarely is—prefaced by any conscious overt intention to do so; rather, I just raise my arm
(Anscombe 1972, § 19 ff; Vogler 2016). Among the countless voluntary actions I perform
every day, only some of them are preceded by a consciously formulated plan of action that
I overtly select. But even for those voluntary actions that are prompted—but not caused—by
antecedent urges or articulated proposals for acting, what renders them voluntary is not
the presence of any antecedent conscious experiences of volitions or intentions; rather it
is due to the person’s capacity to exercise rational self-control in guiding the initiation,
continuation, and cessation of her actions, actions that actualize and embody her reasons for

Religions 2024, 15, 662

so acting. In short, because Thomists reject this plank of the causal theory operationalized
in the Libet-style experiments, Thomists already have a reason for doubting that these
experiments even assay voluntary action. But if they do not test our exercise of free will,
what psychological phenomenon do they target?
The clue is found in the Libet-style experiments’ focus on experiencing a “conscious
awareness of the voluntary urge or intention to act” or a “sense of agency”. Whatever
a conscious urge to act or a sense of agency might be, it is certainly not a paradigmatic
action, for it is something that dawns upon a person, not something an agent initiates. As we
have seen, Thomists argue that the facts of psychological experience reveal that voluntary
actions neither require nor are identified by the presence or absence of these antecedent
items of awareness—such as the quotidian urges or feelings manifested by physiological
exigencies to drink, eat, cough, sneeze, yawn, vomit, or relieve oneself. Consequently, the
phenomenon Libet-style experiments conceptualize as a paradigmatic voluntary action
would from the Thomist point of view be conceptualized as a paradigmatic non-action;
this is because spontaneous urges, antecedent passions (see Aquinas 1952–1954, Truth, 26.7;
Aquinas 2003, De malo 3.11; 12.1; Aquinas 1981, ST I–II.24.3ad1; 77.6), and any sudden
awareness of a wish or prompting to act are quintessential acts of a human, not human
actions. Peter Hacker insightfully points out:
“Strikingly, Libet’s theory would in effect assimilate all human voluntary action to
the status of inhibited sneezes or sneezes which one did not choose to inhibit. For,
in his view, all human movements are initiated by the brain before any awareness
of a desire to move, and all that is left for voluntary control is the inhibiting or
permitting of the movement that is already underway”. (Bennett and Hacker
2022, p. 249)
In short, the Thomist re-interpretation of the Libet-style experiments reveals that a
phenomenon that is, in fact, a paradigmatic passion has been conceptually misrepresented
as being the essential mark of a voluntary action. Before we conclude, there is a final feature
essential to the Thomist conception of human action that is entirely overlooked by the
Libet-style experiments.
A basic requirement for any good scientific experiment is the need to identify and
control for potential interfering factors. One of the fundamental flaws in all of the Libetstyle experiments on free will is the failure to conceptualize the basic structure of a human
action, namely, that persons act for purposes or ends. Among human actions, Aquinas,
unlike Libet, carefully delineates intentions, which are the adoption of some end to be
achieved through action, from deliberations about the most suitable actions or “means” (ad
finem) to be performed to achieve some intended end, from decisions or choices that select
an action to be performed so as to achieve an intended end, and from commands which
constitute the execution of a chosen action (see Aquinas 1981, ST I–II.6–17; Westberg 1994,
chp. 8–12). No scientific experiment can accurately assay intentional action without, at
the very least, identifying and controlling for both the action as well as the end for which
the agent is acting. But this is precisely what the Libet-style experiments’ conception of
intentional action completely overlooks and therefore fails to control for. The participants
in Libet’s experiments were neither merely performing a single conscious intentional
action nor simply waiting to be aware of their conscious urge to act. Rather, they were
human persons, like Jones, volunteering to participate in Libet’s experiment, who were
intentionally following Libet’s instructions of what to do in the experiment, and were
intentionally anticipating and waiting to be consciously aware of what Libet described
to them as a conscious urge, wish, intention, decision, etc., to move their finger, and they
were intentionally (trying) to be “spontaneous” while paying attention to the Libet Clock
in the way they were instructed to do so. What the Libet-style experiments fail to control
for are these potential interfering factors, for any one of these standing intentions might
have initiated or caused the purported antecedent readiness potential in the supplementary
motor cortex of the subject’s brain that was causally involved with the movement in the
subject’s finger. While the Libet-style experiments might consistently and robustly show

Religions 2024, 15, 662

16 of 21

that there is a readiness potential in the supplementary motor cortex that is antecedent to
and predictive of the subject’s conscious awareness of an urge to move one’s finger—i.e., a
nonvoluntary happening akin to becoming aware of a stomach ache or recalling an upcoming
dentist appointment, and so not a human action—they neither show that these readiness
potentials cause a human action nor rule out that the readiness potential might itself be
caused by any of the aforementioned standing intentions of subjects, like Jones, who are
intentionally following the instructions given to them.
Note well, this is a fundamental confounding problem that all past and future Libetstyle experiments on the neuroscience of free will must address before any radical skeptical
conclusions can be drawn about free will based on these experiments. If experimenters
cannot control for what influence the subject’s free choice and intention to participate in the
experiment might be having on their nervous system while they are engaged in the tasks
of the experiment, they cannot rule out the real difference-making role voluntary choices
have on our brains and our actions.22
6. Concluding Remarks
My comparison of Thomist and causal theories of action established that Thomists
present an alternative conception of voluntary action and free will to that held by causal
theorists. I also argued that there are independent philosophical reasons for thinking the
Thomist conception is not beleaguered by the major problems confronting the causal theory,
problems inherited by Libet-style experiments which subscribe to the causal theory. I
went on to show that the Libet-style experiments endorsed a version of the casual theory
which I argued mistakenly contends that a necessary mark of a voluntary action is its prior
conscious volition or intention. I also argued that in their attempts to operationalize this
confused conception of voluntary action, Libet-style experiments mistakenly conceptualize
psychological phenomena (like conscious urges to act) as paradigmatic volitions, but they
are more plausibly conceptualized as instances of nonvoluntary passions and so are not
voluntary phenomena of any kind. Finally, I pointed out that the Libet-style experiments
neither rule out nor experimentally control for the difference-making role of an agent’s
own intentions to follow the instructions of Libet’s experiment by watching a Libet Clock
and waiting to note the time of the anticipated “urge or intention” to move one’s finger.
Consequently, and following MacIntyre’s strategy for engaging rival traditions, the Thomist
tradition can vindicate the superiority of its account of free will over those rival traditions’
conceptions of free will. It is not vulnerable to the fatal internal problems of the causal
theory, and it can also explain why the causal theory has the internal problems it does
and why it cannot solve these problems without rejecting its position and drawing on
the insights of the Thomist tradition. These insurmountable internal difficulties with
the causal theories of action—which are inherited by the experiments operationalizing
this philosophical position—are in part due to its failures to conceive adequately the very
phenomena at issue, namely, the complexities of everyday human action and its connections
to mere acts of humans. What lessons does a comparative study of rival traditions like this
one teach us about Thomist engagements with science?
Thomists need to draw attention to the swath of rival and incompatible conceptions of basic psychological phenomena when confronting scientific experiments on these
psychological phenomena. All scientific investigations operationalize concepts in the formulation of their experimental questions, designs, hypotheses, executions, and interpretations.
Thomists must therefore be cautious to avoid what Sarah Coakley identifies in her Gifford
Lectures as “naïve correlationism” in all their scientific engagements; they cannot presume
all scientifically operationalized concepts are tradition-neutral. As we have seen, this
is no less true of neuroscientific experiments on voluntary action and free will; indeed,
experiments of this kind are especially tendentious because there are such widespread
disagreements among plain persons of commonsense and among rival theoretical traditions about basic psychological concepts like those concerning human action and free will.
So, any experiment can be criticized on both scientific and philosophical grounds. One

Religions 2024, 15, 662

17 of 21

substantive failure of neurophilosophy’s skeptical conclusions has been its unwarranted
assumption that the Libet-style experiments interrogated free will as such, when they merely
operationalized one highly debatable philosophical conception of free will. There are only
neuroscience experiments that operationalize either a particular commonsensical or a particular theoretical tradition’s conception of free will. Neuroscience is not neutral concerning
these conceptual disagreements, for it inescapably endorses one conceptual framework
over others by virtue of the very way in which it operationalizes certain concepts in its
experiments. Neuroscientists and neurophilosophers who claim particular experiments
undermine or falsify free will full stop lack circumspection. They have missed the fact that
their particular conception of free will operationalized in a particular style of experiment is
but one among many tendentious conceptions of free will. If we wish to critically engage
in the scientific study of free will, we must also ask: which conception of free will has been
operationalized in these experiments?
Because most philosophers and scientists working on these issues take for granted a
causal theory of human action, Thomists must realize from the outset that any attempt to
engage this (and similar) philosophical and scientific literature will require a considerable
task of critical re-interpretation and transposition, without which Thomists are likely to
distort and equivocate rather than illuminate their disagreements with these rival traditions
of enquiry. Thomists interested in reflecting on the significance of experimental research
with respect to Aquinas’s view of human agency should not be caught unaware of the
underlying rival philosophical positions that have generated these experiments and their
standard interpretations. From a Thomist point of view, what is needed in the brain science
of free will is conceptual clarity and a more adequate understanding of the varieties of
human activities, not just more experiments. Until this occurs, it is arguable that many
neuroscientists are not even conducting experiments that assay conscious voluntary actions,
but paradigmatic cases of nonvoluntary passions. More attention should be given to
what is meant by voluntary, involuntary, nonvoluntary, free, coerced, omitted, intentional,
unintentional, and nonintentional operations before we ever begin to make claims about
“free will” and the metaphysics of compatibilism, determinism, or libertarianism. For
Thomists, the latter metaphysical debates concerning natures and the power of free will
can only be arrived at and understood through our knowledge of the former array of
everyday human operations.23 I have presented a survey of some of the more recent Thomist
contributions to this task and shown why they put in question the conceptions of voluntary
action operationalized in the neuroscience of free will. Much more needs to be said to
defend these theses, but what the Thomist account of voluntary action presented here has
illustrated is how we can free the will from the mistaken conceptions of free will assumed
by neurophilosophy skeptics of free will.

“In a typical Libet-style experiment the task includes selecting between options that are on a par for the participant, for instance,
pressing a right or left button according to what the participant “freely wants” when a cue appears. Following the distinction set
forth by Ullmann-Margalit and Morgenbesser (1977), this type of selection between options that make no difference to the subject
is termed “picking” and is distinguished from “choosing” in which there is a reason for the selection of one of the alternatives”

Aquinas treats appetitive operations and their objects in the Prima Secundae; he establishes the existence of the appetitive powers
that ground these operations earlier in ST I.80–83. N.B.: Aquinas employs the distinction between “acts of a human” and “human
actions” both contrastively and as a genus-to-species relationship. In ST I–II.1.1, he seems to use it both ways. Like Ralph
McInerny (1992, p. 13) and others, I use it contrastively wherein “human actions” are not included in the class of “acts of a human”
and vice versa. Some, like Anscombe (2005, chp. 15), stipulatively employ the distinction as a genus-to-species relationship.
Nothing of philosophical substance hangs on either stipulated use; what matters philosophically is what distinguishes “human
actions” from other psychological phenomena pertaining to humans.

“A fully voluntary movement is one which the agent controls in its inception, continuation, and termination. Hence blinking is
only partly voluntary, since one can blink at will, but cannot control its ‘continuation’ or termination, and sneezing is only partly
voluntary, inasmuch as one can inhibit it but not initiate it directly” (Bennett and Hacker 2022, p. 241).

“. . .all of the self-initiated acts were described as ‘spontaneous’; the subjects reported that each urge or wish to act appeared
suddenly ‘out of nowhere’, with no specific preplanning or preawareness that it was about to happen” (Libet et al. 1983, p. 638;
see also Libet 1985, p. 530).

22

A further difficulty for any radical skeptical interpretations of the results of scientific experiments is that they frequently imply
the self-defeating conclusion that humans do not have the power to perform scientific experiments. For a detailed version of this
argument, see (De Haan 2021). This argument could be extended to the responsible control required for conducting experiments
and would thereby confute Robert Sapolsky’s most recent skeptical conclusions about free will and moral responsibility, which
were published after this article was written. He contends that if we “put all the scientific results together, from all the relevant scientific
disciplines, and there’s no room for free will” (Sapolsky 2023, p. 5). Sapolsky chooses not to provide definitions of free will or
determinism, but instead provides a litany of biological, psychological, and social influences on a neuron that causes the finger of
a human to pull a trigger—none of these cited influences would surprise any contemporary advocate of free will, least of all
Thomists. Nevertheless, Sapolsky then gives this strawman litmus test for free will: “show me a neuron being a causeless cause
in this total sense . . . [T]his bar is neither absurd nor too high. Show me a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior is
independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you’ve demonstrated free will” (Sapolsky 2023,
p. 5). Like most free will defenders, Thomists believe all psychological powers, including free will, are influenced by a host of
factors, and the will itself cannot operate apart from the co-operation of practical reason. Because few believe free will acts as
“causeless cause” in some “total sense”—indeed, for Thomists, God alone is a causeless cause—Sapolsky cannot be confuting
free will simpliciter, but only a theory of free will which very few people have chosen to defend as reasonable. For a balanced
philosophical critical review, see (Fischer 2023).

Aquinas (1981, ST I.77.3); and Aquinas (1984, Disputed Questions on the Soul, p. 13). I defend this point at length in De Haan
(2022a).

Abstract
Debates about the concept of Free Will date back to ancient times. About 40 years ago, Benjamin Libet designed an experiment showing that the conscious intention to move is preceded by a specific pattern of brain activation. His finding suggested
that unconscious processes determine our decisions. Libet-style experiments have continued to dominate the debate about
Free Will, pushing some authors to argue that the existence of Free Will is a mere illusion. We believe that this dispute is
because we often measure Free Will using arbitrary human decisions rather than deliberate actions. After reviewing the
definition of Free Will and the related literature, we conclude that the scientific evidence does not disprove the existence of
Free Will. However, our will encounters several constraints and limitations that should be considered when evaluating our
deeds’ personal responsibility.

Introduction
As you begin to read this sentence, you may think that our
thoughts motivating this text were freely developed, and that
the typing movements we used to put our thoughts in writing were also freely made. That is a strong presumption and
is often articulated in support of a key cognitive difference
between humanity and other species. This subjective intuition about freedom underlies many human behaviors including moral responsibility. However, despite the universal feeling of being the free conscious agents of what we think and
what we do, the notion of Free Will remains obscure and
controversial. For example, David Hume defined the will
as: “…the internal impression we feel and are conscious
of, when knowingly we give rise to any new motion of our
body, or new perception of our mind” [1]. At the core of the
concept of will, Hume put subjective experience. Indeed, if

a person reports that an action was unwilled, there is no way
to establish for sure that it was not.
The core issue for us for an understanding of the brain
mechanisms of will is what is meant by free. The term free,
in connection with the word “will” might be misleading. It
does not mean that we can do whatever we want. We do have
several constraints within which we can exercise our power
to choose. There are three conditions that indicate that an
action was free [2]: the ability to do otherwise, the control
over our actions, and the responsiveness to reason.
Freedom is what we usually think we have and what we
attribute to other adults, except those, for example, who are
incarcerated or under the effect of drugs that can affect a
person’s behavior. However, neurotypical humans often act
on impulse, sometimes even against their interests, unaware
of the consequences of their acts. Living organisms are
endowed with freedom as behavioral variability is an advantageous evolutionary trait. The selection pressure favors
unpredictability [3]. The key point is how the cognitive
system generates and controls the behavioral alternatives
in each situation. In the domain of decision-making, “free”
does not mean free of possible internal or external influences. Our will normally is biased by certain constraints.
But does the presence of constraints contradict the notion
of Free Will?
Indeed, there are absolute and relative constraints. Absolute constraints are those that limit our perception or our

13

freedom of movement in ways we cannot overcome. This is
the human Umwelt, which set barriers against understanding other peoples, other places, and other times. We cannot imagine what it is like to be a bat without sharing its
fundamental structure [4]. Other constraints are effective
but unable to completely block the human will. Rules and
laws firmly push people to behave in specific ways often,
but not always, according to moral judgments we share as
members of human society. However, even in situations
where their lives are at stake, people sometimes choose not
to obey an order considered unjust. Other constraints are
more subtle and can bias our choice in different situations, as
when advertising convinces us to buy what we do not need
or induces us to choose one brand over another. So, many
of our decisions might depend on the influence of overt or
covert constraints, but their prevalence is not absolute, and,
in most cases, there is still room for choice.
It is claimed that submitting to the power of a constraint
depends only on predetermined features of our character.
In a sense, the universe and our behavior are determined
only by its previous state(s). Causal determinism had been
defined as the claim that “the prevailing laws of nature are
such that there do not exist any two possible worlds which
are exactly alike up to some time, which differ thereafter,
and in which those laws are never violated” [5]. If we take
this deterministic philosophical stance to its extreme consequences, our actions, our choices, and the brain activity that
determines them would be caused only by preceding states.
In this extreme view, there would be no room for Free Will.
Everything would be pre-determined, as in the vision of
those who believe in an almighty God who controls all our
actions. However, the opposite view of a non-deterministic
world does not necessarily endorse the idea that we have
Free Will. Indeed, if the universe were non-deterministic, the
alternative view would be that all undetermined events were
at random. Then it would be chance, and not our will, that
determines the course of events: a fact difficult to reconcile
with the notion of Free Will.
Finally, there is a further possibility: that the universe
might be in part ruled by probabilistic laws, that are characteristic of the behavior of living agents, and that these
agents, by means of their evolutionary pressure, could have
shaped the environment in which we humans live in. In that
view, Free Will, strongly kinked with social responsibility, would be an emergent property of the evolution of the
human brain function and organization.
Thus, it appears that there are only two philosophical
positions that allow for Free Will: compatibilism and libertarianism. The former is the belief that Free Will is compatible with determinism. According to this view, causal
determinism poses no threat to our status, as morally responsible agents as the freedom to do otherwise is sufficient for
the kind of control an agent must possess to be morally

13

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

responsible for her actions. Libertarians, on the contrary,
think that Free Will can be saved only if the universe is
indeterministic. Some libertarians think that the will is free
within a physical universe characterized by a probabilistic
behavior of particles at the subatomic level. Others are dualists, invoking the possibility that a non-physical mind can
override physical causality. Among them, Rene Descartes
maintained that the mind was a nonphysical substance that
interacted with the body at the level of the pineal gland.
More recent dualists were the philosopher of science Karl
Popper and the neuroscientist John Eccles [6]. We think a
scientific standing should be maintained within a monistic
view, avoiding any stopgap solution that implies a kind of
Cartesian theater where a conscious mind observes the sensory data collected by the brain. Indeed, we are our brain,
and our mind comes out of it.
In recent years, the development of neuroscience has led
to an ever-deeper understanding of the way in which the
brain perceives and produces actions, generates thoughts,
and determines relationships between humans. Some experimental studies have investigated the chain of events, out
of awareness, that precede the activation of movements or
simple decisions. This might lead some people to abandon
the belief that we are free agents and follow the claim that
free volition is nothing more than an illusion introduced by
evolutionary selection to give humans a sense of responsibility, without which the human species would probably
have destroyed itself [7–10]. Those authors have reported a
wealth of examples to show how easily we can be misled.
But it does not follow that our direct experiences of will are
typically illusory. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that neural activation only precedes the awareness of
simple, arbitrary decisions but not more complex, deliberate
choices.
Our view is that different choices including intentional
choices tend to recruit specific neural networks regardless of
whether the choice begins out of consciousness or whether
the agent believes it is her choice. We claim that many factors constrain the choices we make that consistently limit,
but not abolish, our freedom of choice. Limits and constraints do not disprove the general, philosophical, notion of
Free Will, which is strongly linked to that of human choice
and responsibility. Therefore, neuroscience research cannot
solve the philosophical debate about Free Will, but by helping to describe the context of human decisions, can bring
transformative effects on the legal approach to criminal law
[11].
Below, we discuss two separate aspects of Free Will: the
timing of will in relation to a movement and the sense of
agency that people feel when deciding. These two processes
concern overlapping but different brain networks. Later we
will also discuss the relationship between consciousness and
Free Will before returning to the role, if any, that cognitive

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

neuroscience can have in defining the limits of Free Will and
personal responsibility.

Different choices and different brain
networks
Recent examinations of Free Will have focused on a paradigm where the participant is asked to make a movement and
report when the action begins. Besides self-report, electromyographic and response time measures are typically collected in such paradigms. The classical finding is that nonconscious movement commands precede the willed action.
When it comes to choosing a simple movement, we find
decisions based on sensory discrimination and choices that
originate from the intention to move. Such movements
correspond to the activation, respectively, of the lateral or
medial motor programming system [12]. Decisions based
on sensory discrimination include, for example, stopping in
front of a red light and starting to walk when the pedestrian
light is green. In the laboratory, a two-alternative forcedchoice paradigm is usually used, requiring participants to
push a button whenever a red light appears and another key
if the light is green. Using this paradigm with non-human
primates has identified two regions of the lateral cortex
that carry out this task: the intraparietal lateral cortex and
the dorsolateral frontal cortex. Neuronal activity in both
these areas covaries with the final decision but not with the
stimulus. The neurons in these regions change their activity
according to the motivation for action. The posterior parietal
cortex appears to be specialized for multisensory integration and the coordinate transformation required to convert
sensory input to enable motor output [13]. Besides being a
node of the dorsal attention network, engaged by working
memory, and executive functions, the dorsolateral frontal
cortex supports cognitive selection of sensory information
and response by comparing the output of different pools of
neurons selectively tuned to specific kinds of stimuli [14].
Sensory discrimination may be simple, but it tends to be
conscious and not automatic. As we next indicate, the conscious will follow the response to the stimuli.
The medial motor system is a network including the inferior parietal lobule and the medial precentral area (MPA),
consisting of the supplementary motor area (SMA), the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and their strong connections with the basal ganglia. In most cases, the intention
to move is linked to the expected utility of the action that
will follow.
The formal models that relate the parameters underlying this kind of choice, as in the reinforcement learning
algorithms, are based on three steps: (1) the attribution of
value to a set of possible competing actions; (2) the selection of the action (usually the one with the highest value);

863

and (3) a comparison between the movement’s effect with
what was expected. Determining the value of an action typically depends on the expected reward or loss, on the cost to
obtain the reward or to avoid the loss, and on the probability
of success associated with the action. Note that this model
assumes that the agent is always rationally motivated to act.
However, several behavioral neuroeconomic studies have
demonstrated that in humans, this is not always the case.
As an example, we usually give greater weight to possible
losses than gains and attribute different weights to the same
actions in near versus remote future time points (hyperbolic
time discounting) [15].
The neural networks encoding choices based on the value
of the expected result include the dorsal and ventral striatal
cortical loops. The dorsolateral striatum and its connection
with somatosensory and motor-cortical regions are associated with automatic and stereotyped actions and behavioral schema, also referred to as habit [16]. Dorsomedial
striatum and its connections with the orbito-frontal cortex
are involved in goal-directed actions typically associated
with controlled movements and behaviors that are sensitive
to obtaining a desired outcome. Human ventral striatum
changes its activity in relation to many kinds of rewards,
ranging from food to abstract social or esthetic values and
is involved in learning by trial-and-error [17]. Together with
the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, it
forms a key circuit evaluating reward prediction errors [18].
The striatum and related regions are organized in series, so
that the repetition of the action or behavior gradually shifts
the activation from the most dorsal to the most ventral loops
compatible with the attainment of a routine. In this way,
the repetition of an action or a behavior becomes more and
more automatic, with a parallel progressive loss of conscious
control [19].
In attributing value to an action, the reward or punishment
associated with it is of fundamental importance. Rewards
and punishments are positive or negative reinforcers,
respectively. The reinforcements are defined as “primary”
if they are related to stimuli connected with the satisfaction of basic requests of our organism. Primary reinforcers
are those concerning not only food, sex, and violence but
also environmental and social interactions. A stimulus is a
secondary reinforcer if it is permanently connected to primary reinforcements. In humans, a typical secondary reinforcer is money. The type and intensity of the reinforcers
can vary enormously. However, while the representation of
stimuli varies according to their characteristics (e.g., a visual
stimulus-reinforcer has a representation in the visual cortex
that of an olfactory stimulus-reinforcer in the corresponding
olfactory cortex), the value of the decision to which they are
associated is calculated by the same network that involves
the striatum, the orbito-frontal cortex, and the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex. In this way, the decision values can be

13

864

compared with the same metric, making it possible to select
the most advantageous stimulus for responding.
To sum up this section, both choices based on sensory
discrimination and decisions based on the expected value of
reward may not be subject to conscious reflection. It appears
that most of what we do in our everyday life might start
automatically and become conscious only after the behavior
is initiated. This has rather obvious implications for the idea
of Free Will.

The timing of the intention to move
The demonstration that conscious volition can follow the
preparation of a movement was first reported by Libet and
colleagues [20]. Subjects sat on a lounge chair facing an
oscilloscope where a spot of light moved clockwise near
the circumference, simulating the secondhand sweep of a
clock. Subjects made movements of the right hand whenever
they wanted to and then reported the time of willing the
movement (W) or of awareness of moving (M). Movement
initiation was recorded by EMG over the activated muscle
of the forearm. These times were compared with the EEG
activity that preceded the movement: a slowly rising negative potential named the readiness potential (RP). Results
showed that M was close to the actual movement, and W
was about 300 ms before movement onset. RP onset was
about 1 s before movement. i.e., occurring 700 ms prior
to W, a compelling suggestion that movement preparation
anticipates the conscious intention to move. Libet’s experiment included only 5 subjects. However, its findings were
replicated several times. A recent quantitative meta-analysis
of the literature [21] revealed that the temporal pattern found
by Libet and colleagues was robust, especially for the difference between unconscious brain activity and conscious
intention to move, the most crucial time difference regarding
implications about conscious causation and Free Will. A
few methodological alterations of Libet’s experiment yielded
temporal patterns partially different from the original one
[22, 23].
A similar experimental paradigm was investigated with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) instead of
EEG to obtain a better spatial locus of participants’ brain
activity [24–26]. However, the time resolution of fMRI is
very slow compared to EEG. The results showed that brain
activity was predictive of the upcoming action about 10 s in
advance of the performed movement, and that subjects had
the subjective sense of deciding only about 1 s prior to the
movement. Recording neuronal activity in 12 drug-resistant
epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes to localize
the focus of seizure onset, Fried et al. [27] showed a progressive increase or decrease of firing rate, particularly in the
supplementary motor area (SMA), approximately 1500 ms

13

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

before subjects reported making the decision to move. They
also demonstrated that by stimulating the pre-SMA, patients
reported “an urge” to move a specific part of the contralateral body. The results showed that small assemblies of single
neurons in the medial frontal lobe not only precede volition
but can also predict volition and its time of occurrence on a
single trial basis.
Differences between studies also reflect the effect of the
instructions given to the experimental subjects. It is particularly important to distinguish between wanting to do
something and intending to do it. One might have competing “wants” and only later develop the intention to settle one
plan. Furthermore, we should distinguish between intentions
and urges. All these factors, related either to technical features or to behavioral and procedural differences, moderated
the original pattern found by Libet et al. [20] but confirmed
the main finding that brain activity can precede the conscious decision to move [28].
In this framework, intentions are not only states of mind
but also brain states, and that many movements are made
without formation of a conscious intention [28]. As an example, many action that we perform when driving are made
automatically, without a conscious decision to act, but are
considered to be voluntary.
One of the main arguments against the view that the Libet
et al. [20] experiment provides evidence against a causal
role for consciousness in human decision-making is that the
repetitive small movements that participants were requested
to make in the laboratory have nothing to do with Free Will,
i.e., with a conscious decision. Indeed, in that experiment,
the true decision was taken before entering the EEG laboratory or the MRI scanner, and it was that of taking part in
the experimental procedure and preparing for a series of
movement trials.
To investigate to what degree RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions, Maoz et al. [29] compared deliberated and arbitrary decision-making during a
$1000-donation task to a non-profit organization. Results
confirmed the presence of RPs for arbitrary decisions but not
for the deliberate ones. These findings are congruent with
the view that the RP represents accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations of brain activity driving simple and arbitrary decisions. Schurger et al. [30] elaborated this view proposing a leaky stochastic accumulator to model the neural
decision to move in the absence of temporal cues. According
to this model, the moment at which the decision threshold
is crossed is determined by spontaneous sub-threshold fluctuations in neural activity. Crossing the threshold leads to
movement and indeed, according to the model, fluctuations
appear as a gradual increase in neuronal activity as demonstrated at the single-neuron level. They also demonstrated
that stimulating the pre-SMA, patients reported “an urge”
to move a specific part of the contralateral body [27, 31].

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

Libet [32] also noted that movements initiated unconsciously could be consciously vetoed. In essence, he argued
that freedom was reduced from “Free Will” to “Free Won’t.”
Using fMRI, Brass and Haggard [33] showed that a specific
area of the frontal-medial cortex is more strongly activated
when people prepare manual actions but then intentionally
cancel them, compared with when they prepare and then
complete the same actions. Further studies [34] have documented that antecedent brain activity RP can predict not only
the decision to perform an action but also that to inhibit it.
In summary, the human brain contains a network associated with intentional actions. That network is centered on
the frontal-medial cortex, including the pre-supplementary
motor area (pre-SMA) and the cingulate motor area (CMA).
Inhibition of intentional actions involves a fronto-median
cortical area distinct both from pre-SMA and CMA. As
demonstrated in the Libet-style experiments, activity in the
network involved in intentional actions precedes the conscious decision of initiating the movement or to inhibit it.
However, experimental evidence collected with the Libet
procedure concern arbitrary motor decisions, which have
little to do with the Free Will debate, in which it is necessary
to collect evidence concerning deliberate purposeful decisions in contextually meaningful circumstances.

Agency
Agency (more specifically self-agency) is when a person
realizes that she has decided to act or to make a specific
action. This is the feeling that leads us to attribute an action
to ourselves rather than to another person. The process that
allows self-agency involves matching the planned movement
with the observation of a compatible movement that follows.
This requires a match/mismatch detector and a close temporal relationship between what was willed and the result. The
brain performs this computation by comparing the motor
command with the feed-forward signal issued together with
it and the feedback signal detected by the sensory system.
To investigate the neural substrate that allows the sense of
agency, Farrer et al. [35] used a joystick device and modulated the feedback by showing on a computer screen the
movement of a virtual hand that was either compatible or
had different degrees of discrepancy between what was executed, and the movement seen on the screen. The main findings relying upon blood flow positron emission tomography
(PET) were that the less subjects felt in control of the movements of the virtual hand, the higher the level of activation in
the inferior part of the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ),
while a reverse covariation was observed in the right posterior insula. Similar results were obtained by Nahab et al. [36]
using fMRI. Subjects wore a data glove that registered the
movement at each finger joint. This information was used to

865

drive the image of the glove on a screen where it could mirror exactly the hand movement or provide various mixtures
of true and arbitrary signals. The results showed two temporal patterns in brain areas involved in the modulation of
self-agency. The leading network was characterized by early
activation and moderate decline during task repetition and
included the right temporal parietal junction, anterior insula,
and precuneus. The lagging network had a delayed onset and
a very slow decline during task repetition and included the
middle frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. The
results were interpreted with the leading network serving the
role of mismatch detector and the lagging network receiving
this information and mediating its elevation to conscious
awareness, giving rise to self-agency.
Patients with functional movement disorders, who display motor symptoms (e.g., tremor) without a neurological
cause, use normal voluntary motor pathways but paradoxically experience that tremor as involuntary, an example of
impaired self-agency. Interestingly, Voon et al. [37] showed
with fMRI that those patients had a right TPJ hypoactivity
and a lower connectivity between right TPJ, sensorimotor
regions (sensorimotor cortex and cerebellar vermis), and
limbic regions (ventral anterior cingulate and right ventral
striatum). They proposed that in patients with functional
movement disorders, the lack of a match for the proprioceptive feedback could lead to perception that the abnormal
movement is not self-generated.
Noninvasive brain stimulation in the right parietal area
can affect the experience of self-agency [38–40]. Extensive
acute lesions of the right hemisphere including the parietal
lobe are often associated not only with neglect (failure to
orient attention toward the contralesional space) but also
with palsy anosognosia (lack of awareness of a contralateral
palsy) [41] or asomatognosia (loss of the sense of ownership
of a limb) [42], sometimes associated with somatoparaphrenia [43] (i.e., delusional misidentification and confabulation
concerning the palsy limb). Among the striking examples
that one of us (PN) has repeatedly witnessed in his clinical
practice are people with complete left hemiplegia who, when
asked to clap their hands as in applauding, did the movement of clapping only with the right hand and then, when
confronted with the lack of any clap sound, said they did
not want to make noise in a hospital environment. In a case
of somatoparaphrenia [44], the patient, after a right hemisphere stroke, was convinced that her sister’s hand was in
her hospital bed and described it as hard and unable to move.
When asked to give a rational explanation, she admitted that
“strange things happen in the subconscious mind.” Other
instances that are encountered in a clinical setting are those
of the alien hand syndrome, a neuropsychological disorder
in which the person experiences that one hand does not obey,
as if it was operating with a mind of its own. Those cases
are either due to callosal lesions or lesions of the pre-SMA

13

866

contralateral to the affected limb [45, 46]. These patients
both grope and grasp objects with the affected hand, while
at the same time trying to stop the unwanted movement with
the intact hand and turn the page of a book with one hand
while they go back to the previous page with the other hand.
Another patient with the same syndrome was accompanying one of the authors (JG) down a laboratory hallway and
reached up with one hand to pull a cord to turn on a hall
decontaminant shower while the other hand grabbed at the
alien hand to prevent it from pulling the cord.
In summary, either because of brain lesions or by noninvasive brain stimulation, we can observe a double dissociation between what we do and what we feel we have
done. There are examples of actions without agency, as in
the alien hand syndrome or during hypnotic experiences,
and examples of illusionary agency, i.e., situations in which
people have the feeling that they are doing something when
they are not as in asomatognosia. Based on this double dissociation, one can argue that the brain has networks distinguishing between the will to do something and the action
itself. Accordingly, the separation of the neural substrate
that allows conscious will and action can also be present
in the everyday life of people without brain lesions. This is
the foundation of the theory of apparent mental causation
[7, 47], which suggests that conscious will is experienced
whenever we can draw the inference that our thought has
caused our action, whether this inference is correct or not.
This can occur in accordance with the principles of priority,
consistency, and exclusivity. Then, we experience conscious
will and ascribe authorship to ourselves for an action when
the thought of an act appears in consciousness just before
an action (priority) is consistent with the action and is not
accompanied by conspicuous alternative causes of the action
(exclusivity).
Some authors [9, 10] have interpreted the theory of apparent mental causation as suggesting that the sense of ourselves as agents and authors of our actions is an illusion
that concerns and permeates all our actions in the world
so that we are not free and morally responsible in the way
we think we are. Nahmias [48] refuted this interpretation
on strictly logical-philosophical grounds. Daniel Wegner,
the major proponent of it, says that he did not intend that
conscious thought cannot cause actions (Wegner [47], page
68), and indeed, it is different to propose that some actions
are done automatically, with little or no conscious control,
or that the illusion of self-agency concerns every human
decision; thereby, we are not morally responsible of what
we do or what we think. Kihlstrom [49] noted that Wegner’s
many examples of illusory involuntariness do not warrant
the conclusion that the experience of voluntariness is also
an illusion.
We should be careful to distinguish between the cause
of an action and its reason. A decision is the deed the

13

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

fills the gap between a possible reason and the consequent
action. The distinction between reason and cause is inextricably linked to the distinction between voluntary action
and a mere event. All voluntary actions are also events,
but the reverse is not true. There is a difference between
falling asleep and letting sleep motivate you to go to sleep
[50]. A motivated action can be deliberate or not: we can
distinguish between impulsive actions, like running away
in fear; spontaneous actions, such as avoiding an obstacle when walking; routine actions, such as washing and
dressing in the morning before going to work; actions that
involve an implicit decision, when we interrupt what we
were doing because of being attracted by something or
someone else; and finally those involving an explicit decision, sometimes deliberations, like when we decide the
amount to save for the education of our children. The role
of consciousness can vary according to the type of voluntary actions. Yet, nothing demonstrates that if we could
control a given set of factors that shapes one’s personality,
we could predict people’s decision. In this probabilistic
domain, there is a place for human will even if it would be
a misnomer to claim this will is completely free, as what
we can want depends also on our sensory-motor limits, our
personality, and on the environment.
However, take the example of the driver queuing on the
highway, who applies the brake to avoid hitting the car in
front of his car that suddenly and unexpectedly slows down.
Stepping on the brake pedal is an automatic movement, but
the efficacy of applying the brake depends on habits and
decisions that characterize the driving style of the driver.
Such habits include a general attitude to drive with caution
or recklessness, procedures like devoting most attentional
resources to driving while refraining from texting over the
cell phone or avoid to engaging in an argument during driving. In this context, there is no firm boundary between automatic and effortful actions.
One can argue that both habits and decisions are influenced by an individual’s personality traits that in turn are
biased by genetics and environment (a broad term that
includes education, social background, and personal experiences). Do we think that despite all the multiple factors
that might influence the driver’s behavior there is space for
his responsibility in hitting or not hitting the car in front of
him? In real life, we all believe that yes, the driver is at least
partly responsible. Indeed, even in this case, in which the
ultimate cause was definitively an automatic movement, we
would be hesitant to accept the lack of freedom of choice
as a plausible reason for what happened. Is there empirical
evidence that a person cannot change his disposition and
hence, for example, his driving style? And how could he take
the responsibility for the effect of his driving if he were not
at least in part free? We think that Free Will and personal
responsibility, in this, as in similar cases, cannot be denied

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

but should be evaluated in relationship with all the factors
that might have influenced the person’s behavior.
In sum, there is no evidence that our will is fully determined by the laws of nature. Also, there is no evidence
against the will linking the reason of an action with its deed.
Therefore, the theory of the apparent mental causation operates in a restricted space: that of actions requiring only a
limited integrative role of consciousness (e.g., automatic,
impulsive, spontaneous, and habitual actions).

Consciousness
Given that Free Will usually involves a conscious decision,
understanding the boundaries of conscious information
processing becomes important for characterizing Free Will.
Consciousness is a word that encompasses a wide range of
seemingly related meanings, from the basic “awareness of
environment,” which would include unicellular organisms,
to the more complex “awareness of awareness” that would
leave out great apes and human infants. Consciousness provides the window in which we make intentional and willed
decisions. For the sake of simplicity, we use consciousness
when information is accessible to us for reasoning and controlling behavior. However, if we consider all the different
situations that we undergo in everyday life (e.g., sleep and
dreaming) and those conditions in which consciousness is
impaired or disrupted (e.g., coma, general anesthesia, seizures, disorientation, loss of movements to painful stimuli),
we can conclude that consciousness varies along a continuum according to at least two dimensions: wakefulness and
awareness.
Theories that view consciousness as an emerging property of the brain usually assume that local states of consciousness may involve different degrees of integration and
different impact on the processes of decision-making (i.e.,
spatio-temporal, multisensory, semantic integration, and
integration of novel information). Usually, the more complex or novel the stimuli, the more likely consciousness will
be needed for integration to occur, but there is no absolute
dependency of integration on consciousness [51]. Indeed,
there can be consciousness without Free Will, but it is generally recognized that Free Will requires consciousness. But
consciousness is not enough: a Free Will scenario requires
the possibility to envisage alternative courses of events (freedom of imagination), the ability to weigh reasons to choose
among alternatives (freedom of evaluation), the possibility
to decide and intend an action (freedom of decision or will),
and the freedom to cause, control, and execute an action to
carry through the decision (freedom of execution) [52]. The
examination of consciousness in the context of Free Will is
simply describing the workspace within which “free” will
operates.

Freedom and its limits
Freedom of imagination and its limits
Imagine that you are driving the usual path from your office
to home. You know that before getting home, you have
planned to stop by your friend’s home to discuss with her
a common project. You have driven the road between your
house and hers many times, and you do not consider that
you might take a more direct route. In this case, you have
not consciously envisioned an alternative course of action,
so freedom does not come into play. This conclusion would
apply whenever you are told to behave in a certain way
without considering that you might have done otherwise.
To have freedom of imagination is to be conscious that you
had a choice. A positive example of freedom of imagination
is human creativity. One of the most complex and intriguing forms of creativity is musical improvisation where new
music is produced in real-time as in improvisation. A recent
study [53] explored whole-brain functional network connectivity from fMRI data during jazz music improvisation
compared with a pre-learned score performance. Results
demonstrated that a state of weak connectivity is associated with a feeling of “flow” allowing unhindered musical
creation. In other words, human creativity, i.e., freedom of
imagination, is enhanced with attenuated executive control.

Freedom of evaluation and unconscious bias
Mudrik et al. [54] have provided an extensive review of the
typology of threats to Free Will due to unconscious influences on decision making. They include the effects of framing information on a subsequent decision, the nudging effect
by which components of the decision process (the alternatives, the outcomes, or the correspondence between them)
can be presented in ways that favor a specific choice, the
racial, gender and facial appearance stereotypes, and the
physiological and psychological state of who is deciding
(e.g., fatigue, hunger, sleep deprivation, and mood). Unconscious biases are instantiated in our brains at an early age
and influence how we make choices, particularly in ambiguous circumstances when rapid responses are required.
If a person never considers the reason why he should
choose one action over others, he has lost the capacity for
freely evaluating a subsequent choice. As both control and
reason-responsiveness vary in degree from person to person and in different contexts, we can posit that the apparent freedom of our will can also vary. Thus, the notion that
Free Will has constraints that may or not be overcome by
conscious deliberation helps to shape further research on
what determines our moral responsibility as agents.

13

868

Freedom of decisions and constraints that limit it
Our freedom is dependent upon personal, environmental,
and social constraints. In turn, constraints can be absolute or relative. Absolute personal constraints are those
dependent on our body’s physiology. Relative personal
constraints depend on the role of the genomic influences
on our personality and character, our social skills, learned
beliefs, and the culture we find ourselves in.
There is abundant evidence that personality traits are
substantially influenced by genes. Current models propose that personality is instantiated in the brain, distally
caused by genes and environment. Human personality is
30–60% heritable according to twin and adoption studies [55], confirmed by the Genome Wide Association
Study (GWAS) of the Finnish population and replicated
in Korean and German samples [56]. The effects of genetic
constitution on behavior have been recognized as extenuating factors in sentencing homicide cases. In the USA,
a case that caused quite a stir was that of the sentence
concerning the case of Mr. Davis Bradley Waldroup, who,
on the 26th of October 2006, had repeatedly attempted to
kill his wife and had killed a female friend who was trying to defend her. Davis was charged with premeditated
murder (first degree under American law) and attempted
premeditated murder. The charges could have carried the
death penalty (then in effect in the state of Tennessee).
The ruling dropped the initial charge to non-premeditated
murder (second degree) and attempted non-premeditated
murder, sentencing Davis to 32 years in prison. This judgment acknowledged the expertise of Professor William
Bernet, a forensic psychiatrist who had just published
a paper on behavioral genetics in crime cases [57]. The
murderer carried a mutation in the monoamine oxidase
A (MAO-A) gene. MAO-A is the main enzyme involved
in the metabolism of serotonin and norepinephrine. The
Low MAO-A mutation causes a reduced expression of the
enzyme and therefore higher concentrations of neurotransmitters that predispose a person not only to adventure and
exploration but also to aggression. As a matter of fact, the
tendency to develop violent behavior is relatively low in
carriers of Low MAO-A mutation and does not differ from
that of individuals who have high enzyme activity (High
MAO-A), provided that the carriers grow up in a healthy
and protective psychosocial environment. It is only when
the environment is characterized by abuse and by serious
situations of family and social hardship that the tendency
to develop aggressive behaviors manifests itself more frequently (up to 85%) in Low MAO-A carriers [58]. That
was the argument in the case of Davis Bradley Waldroup.
Similarly, in 2009, an Italian court cut the sentence given
to a convicted murderer by 1 year because he had the same

13

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

gene mutation linked to violent behavior. This was the first
time that behavioral genetics affected a sentence passed by
a European court [59].
An individual’s belief system is another kind of personal constraint that contributes to shaping our decisions.
It includes political, religious, philosophical, and ideological attitudes or a combination of these. Typically, beliefs
are not required to be true or false and do not exist in isolation in the mind of the believer. They belong to a system
in the sense that they are related to each other.
As to political choices, conspiracy belief systems often
have an outsized influence. A recent example is the QAnon
movement that originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017. The core QAnon theory is that a plot of
satanic cannibalistic sexual abusers of children operating
a global child sex trafficking ring conspired against former
U.S. President Donald Trump during his term in office.
QAnon conspiracy believers have named democratic politicians, Hollywood actors, high-ranking government officials, business tycoons, and medical experts as members of
the plot. Without going into further details, QAnon followers have perpetrated acts of violence on numerous occasions, including their active participation in the attack to
the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Although some people
articulating QAnon beliefs may have been cynically coopting them for their own political purposes, many people
accepted them at face value. But by accepting the QAnon
theory uncritically, it would not be surprising that a person
would be pushed to make political choices congruent with
this belief system, even if irrational. In all these cases,
internal or external circumstances influence the person’s
choice limiting his choices and thus his will.

Freedom of execution
Executing an action does not depend only on our will. It
depends also on the rules and laws of the society we live
in. However, even the more strict and threatening rules
of war can be overwhelmed by human will. “Ich schieße
nicht, I don’t shoot,” said Josef Schulz, a German soldier
who, during World War II, served as a corporal in the
714 Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht. He had been a
capable artist and a member of an underground opposition
to Hitler. On 20 July 1941, he refused to take part in the
execution of 16 Yugoslav partisans and was shot himself
[60]. Similar events have been reported elsewhere and testify to the freedom of the will even in the presence of the
absolute obligation of obedience characteristic of military
laws. However, these extreme examples can be also taken
as a demonstration of the power of circumstances to prevent the execution of what has been called Free Will.

Neurological Sciences (2024) 45:861–871

Conclusions
We summarize our thinking about the decision-making
process required in willed decisions in the context of a
journey in Fig. 1.
The question of Free Will does not refer to the possibility of acting without constraints, but to the scope of the
human will, the nature of human decisions and choices.
In real-life situations, we navigate between both personal
and environmental constraints, including rules, laws, and
dangers of different origins. This means that there is no
absolute Free Will. Instead, freedom has limits based on
genetic, physical, personal, environmental, and social constraints. It is freedom within a ring of constraints. However, this does not threaten the concept of choice, which
is strongly dependent on the possibility to decide among
alternatives even with constraints. Only in our imagination
can absolute freedom potentially exist but again within the
constraints of our imagination.
From a more general philosophical viewpoint, we have
Free Will if we have alternative choices, no matter how
numerous and persuasive the constraints. The sense of
freedom in making choices is something that humans seem
to have acquired during the development of human society.
In Homer’s time, during the Trojan War, the fighters made
their decisions based on the suggestions of the gods. Then,
gradually we built societies more and more based on individual freedom and personal responsibility.
In recent decades, an increasing number of neuroscientists have argued that Free Will is just an illusion, and
that instead of being intentional authors of our life, we are
simply pushed around by past events and by the unconscious working of our brain. We think that this position
is due to the articulation of a strong version of determinism and reductionism. The task of explaining the functions of the mind naturally leads us to look for the neural

869

basis that makes them possible. Groups of neurons, connections between different brain regions, synapses, and
chemical neuromediators can be examined for their relevance to choosing. The basic idea behind rejecting the
notion of Free Will is that if we can explain every action
through a series of causal precedents, there is no space for
Free Will, and indeed of our will tout court. But why we
should reduce the search for causation to low-level neural
or even atomic explanations? Higher-level forms of causation are just as real and as important [61]. Suppose that
we wanted to explain the rules governing car traffic. We
would not have an answer looking at the characteristics of
the engines that propel the cars, but rather to the day of the
week, the opening hours of offices and factories, weather
conditions, the possibility of using alternative means of
transport, and so on.
In conclusion, we do not know for sure whether determinism or indeterminism is true. Neuroscience, like any other
human scientific effort, is looking for causes of the phenomena in its study domain. But causes do not need to be always
searched for at the low level, and we do not need to abandon
a deterministic standing if we look for them elsewhere. In
behavioral sciences, we must deal with randomness and with
human decisions. When studying human behavior and the
interrelations of the nervous system and behavior, we can
only count on probabilistic knowledge, not on compelling
laws. This is often enough to build theories that can guide
neurologists and neurosurgeons that get close to predicting
the results of ablating a specific part of the brain or the effect
of levodopa on a patient with Parkinson disease.
As we have seen, there are many constraints that can
shape our decisions, but the role of our will in determining our future cannot be disregarded. The Free Will that we
need is what gives us the political freedom to move about
in a state governed by law and do what we want to do [61].
People who believe that there are “laws of nature” which

Fig. 1  The figure shows in four stages the limits to one’s Free Will that a person who wants to start a long journey encounters from the moment
she thinks of planning it: (A) freedom of imagination through the phase of evaluation (B) and decision (C) up to its execution (D)

13

870

cause every single human action should reflect that if this
were true, it would apply to each preceding event, going
back to the birth of the universe: the Big Bang. That logic
appears a bit silly to us.
Free Will without constraints is an illusion. Yet, we are
born to choose. And we do. The desire of control through
choice and agency is an essential component of what it means
to be human [62]. The freedom to choose when there are
several constrained is an essential component of personal
responsibility, that in turn is the foundation of human society.
These choices become stored and strengthened in our brains
over our lifetime and guides our behavioral responses denying complete Free Will but allowing us to make decisions
even when the choices appear quite varied. Yet, these choices
never approach the range of decisions and actions that can be
created in our imagination or in a fictional or artificial world
that is limited only by our creativity but not by the real-world
constraints articulated above. So Free Will may be possible
in fantasies whose narratives and images find a place in our
brain but are rarely instantiated, even, when possible, in real
life. Instead, in real life, our wills are corralled, and we move
about within these boundaries, obeying the constraints that
are imposed upon our will. Our will, even if corralled, retains
the freedom of choice and, hence, the personal responsibility
for our deeds and the individual merits of our achievements.
In conclusion, neuroscience cannot disprove the philosophical claim of Free Will, but it can have an important
role in highlighting the factors that can push our choices in
one or another direction.

Defining a Relativity-Proof Notion of the Present via
Spatio-temporal Indeterminism

Abstract
In this paper we describe a novel approach to defining an ontologically fundamental
notion of co-presentness that does not go against the tenets of relativity theory. We survey the possible reactions to the problem of the present in relativity theory, introducing
a terminological distinction between a static role of the present, which is served by
the relation of simultaneity, and a dynamic role of the present, with the corresponding
relation of co-presentness. We argue that both of these relations need to be equivalence
relations, but they need not coincide. Simultaneity, the sharing of a temporal coordinate, need not have fundamental ontological import, so that a relativizing strategy with
respect to simultaneity seems promising. The notion of co-presentness, on the other
hand, does have ontological import, and can therefore not be relativized to an observer
or to an arbitrarily chosen frame. We argue that a formal representation of indeterminism can provide the structure needed to anchor the relation of co-presentness, and
that this addition is in fact congenial to the notion of dynamic time as requiring real
(indeterministic) change. The resulting picture is one of an extended dynamic present,
implying a formal distinction between static (coordinate) simultaneity and dynamic
co-presentness. After working out the basics of our approach in the simpler framework of branching time, we provide our full analysis in the framework of branching
space-times, which allows for a formal definition of modal correlations. The spatial
extension of the dynamic present can reach as far as the modal correlations do. In the
limit, the dynamic present could extend across a maximal space-like hypersurface.

What are the consequences that relativity theory has for the notion of the present,
or more generally for our everyday notion of time? Famously, Minkowski said that
given the experimental corroboration of relativity theory, “space by itself, and time by
itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the

two will preserve an independent reality.”1 A strong formal result appears to vindicate
Minkowski’s view that before the background of the space-time physics of special
relativity theory, time can only be a derivative, dependent notion: there is no sensible
way to define a notion of simultaneity based solely on the resources of the spatiotemporal ordering of events in Minkowski space-time. What are the metaphysical
consequences of this result?
Our commonsense metaphysics of time is, arguably, best expressed by presentism,
which holds that “the present simply is the real considered in relation to two particular
species of unreality, namely the past and the future” [32, p. 245]. Is presentism compatible with relativity theory, or does relativity theory refute presentism? The issue
is complicated. Does relativity theory have an impact on metaphysics or on everyday
notions at all? And if it does, what precisely is the notion of the present whose independent reality is threatened by relativity theory, and how can that threat be spelled
out in a formally precise way?
In this paper, we will distinguish two different notions of the present, one based
on simultaneity and one based on co-presentness. Simultaneity invokes a static role
of the present in singling out something like a temporal location of an event (a time
coordinate). Co-presentness, on the other hand, invokes a dynamic role of the present
in separating a fixed past from an open future and in thereby anchoring a notion of
coexistence. We hold that it is the latter role that is important for presentism as a
doctrine in the metaphysics of time, and we will show that a relativity-proof notion of
the present in its dynamical role can be defended by exploiting the idea that dynamic
change must be based on the indeterministic realization of possibilities for the future.
Given the current state of the debate, the success or failure of such a defense must
be assessed via formal results. We thus need to spell out which formal resources
relativity theory offers, and how these can be used to ground a notion of the present. In
this paper we will work within a formal framework that allows for making precise sense
of spatio-temporal indeterminism and of the fixedness of the past vs. the openness of
the future: branching space-times (BST; [4]). Our guiding idea will be that two events
are dynamically co-present if they share exactly the same fixed past. In working out
the formal details of this idea, we will make use of the fact that BST offers a rich
notion of modal correlations, based on which we will be able to extend the notion of
a fixed past.
Our paper is structured as follows. We introduce the basics of the debate about
defining the present in special relativity in Sect. 1. We provide some motivation for our
approach, which involves an extended present, in Sect. 2. In that section we stay within
the Newtonian theory of branching time, which is a predecessor to BST. The main ideas
of branching space-times and the necessary formal definitions are then introduced in
Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we prove our main formal result, Theorem 1, which states that a
non-trivial relation of co-presentness can be defined in terms of the resources of BST.
We discuss two possible definitions of co-presentness and prove their equivalence,
and we indicate how space-like modal correlations can extend the dynamic present.
We conclude in Sect. 5.

1 The Problem of Defining the Present in Special Relativity
In the Minkowski space-time of special relativity, each so-called event (element of
the space-time) can be uniquely identified via its space-time coordinates, a set of four
real numbers. There is, however, no unique way to divide up these coordinates into
a three-dimensional spatial and a one-dimensional temporal part. Such a division is
always relative to an inertial reference frame, and none of those frames is preferred—
the principle of relativity states that all frames have to be treated on a par. One might
therefore believe that only frame-invariant properties and relations have independent,
objective reality, whereas other properties and relations cannot be taken metaphysically
seriously.
Some important relations among events are frame-invariant. For example, whether
one event can causally influence another one is independent of the choice of a reference
frame: the causal order on Minkowski space-time is frame-invariant. Events that cannot
causally influence one another are called “space-like related”; that relation, too, is
frame-invariant. But whether two space-like related events have the same temporal
coordinate—whether these events occur at the same time—depends on which frame
one considers. The simultaneity of distant events is frame-relative.
These basic truths about the structure of Minkowski space-time can be translated into a formal claim about the definability of a notion of simultaneity. There is
widespread agreement that such a notion of simultaneity has to be transitive, reflexive,
and symmetric, i.e., it has to be an equivalence relation.2 It follows that the simultaneity relation cannot be the relation of space-like relatedness, as that relation is not
transitive. And there are no other sensible options either, as shown by Van Benthem’s
theorem3 : If a relation R is definable on the basis of Minkowski space-time alone, it
has to be invariant under that structure’s automorphisms, which include the Poincaré
group and contractions. But once there are x, y for which x = y and x Ry, one can
employ suitable automorphisms to show that x Rz for any event z. Thus, there are only
two equivalence relations that can be defined on Minkowski space-time, identity and
the universal relation. None of these provides a sensible notion of simultaneity: on the
first option, as each event is identical only to itself, each event would be simultaneous
only with itself, and on the second option, simultaneity would not discriminate among
events at all. Therefore, no frame-invariant notion of simultaneity can be defined on
the basis of the Minkowski space-time of special relativity.
It seems, therefore, that simultaneity cannot be an objective relation. This, in turn,
might mean that the present is just a subjective notion, or even an illusion, which
would completely undermine presentism. This challenge concerns the tenability of
an objective notion of simultaneity as a necessary, not as a sufficient condition of the
tenability of the doctrine of presentism as a whole. The challenge, therefore, arises
prior to and independently of the additional question of how, assuming that such an
objective notion is available, one should model the phenomenon of the passage of time.
In this paper, we do not discuss the latter question. There is fairly widespread agreement

2 See, e.g., [12,35,40,41].
3 See Van Benthem [41, 25f.].

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:644–664

647

in the literature that an indexical treatment of the passage of time is appropriate (see,
e.g. [10]).
The metaphysical consequences of the mentioned formal result—no frameinvariant notion of objective simultaneity is definable in special relativity theory—are
debatable. There appear to be four main ways of reacting:
1. Rejection of any metaphysical status of special relativity. It is not implausible to
just shrug off any suggested metaphysical import of special relativity, pointing
out that that theory is only valid within its range of applicability, which is far
from universal.
Many well established empirical facts, from details of the orbit of planet Mercury
to gravitational effects on satellites or, recently, to gravitational waves cannot
be modeled on the basis of special relativity theory alone. In this sense, special
relativity is empirically refuted, and therefore it is implausible to expect to get
any metaphysical mileage out of it. If we are looking for a space-time theory
to provide metaphysical guidance, we need to look at the general theory of
relativity, or even at a successor to that theory describing some form of quantum
gravity. It may well be that such a theory will provide additional resources. For
example, some cosmological models of general relativity allow for the definition
of a class of fundamental observers that can anchor an absolute notion of cosmic
time. Given these resources, one can then define two events to be absolutely
simultaneous iff they happen at the same cosmic time.4
So the whole discussion involving special relativity might be a non-starter.
2. Acceptance and revision of temporal notions. If one accepts the apparent indefinability of simultaneity as proof that the notion of the present makes no objective
sense, one can try to live without it.
While this attitude had already been recommended (for different reasons) by
Spinoza,5 it appears practically impossible: “now” is an essential indexical
which has both theoretical and practical import for us.6
3. Acceptance and relativization of temporal notions. Each concrete act of communication employing temporal determinations comes from the perspective of
a corporeal being. Reflecting on this fact, one can relativize temporal determinations to the rest frame of that corporeal being,7 and one can additionally point
out that relativistic effects can be neglected for most practical purposes.8 An
4 See [38] for some pertinent qualifications.
5 See his Ethics, Book IV, Proposition 62: “Insofar as the mind conceives of things by the dictate of reason,

it is equally affected whether the idea is of something in the future or in the past or in the present” [39].
6 See, e.g., [27].
7 See [1] for a discussion of some subtle qualifications that pertain to the definition of a relativistic object’s

center of mass. The resulting imprecision is negligible for our purposes. Additionally, it is enough that a
speaker may provide a frame of reference in some way. The easiest way would certainly be via her body,
but there are other possibilities. Compare the similarly imprecise “here” or “now”.
8 See [11] for a succinct, quantitative assessment of the practical lack of impact of relativity theory for
everyday communication. It should be added that the situation has changed somewhat since the publication
of that paper at least if relativistic effects grounding everyday technology are considered as well. Most of
us nowadays carry around GPS receivers whose underlying satellite infrastructure relies heavily on (special
and general) relativistic effects. This technology, however, has no direct impact on our use of temporal
determinations in communication.

123

648

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:644–664

absolute notion of simultaneity is not needed to account for our communication practices—even in hypothetical cases in which relativistic effects become
important. If I say that events e and f are simultaneous, and you, speeding by
in your space-ship, deny this, then we can understand that we are not in fact
disagreeing, but saying different things: I say that e and f are simultaneous for
me, and you say that they are not simultaneous for you.
Such relativizations are in fact common: if I say, “It is raining”, and you say, at a
different place, “It is not raining”, then we are not in fact disagreeing, and we can
make the compatibility of our assertions explicit by mentioning our respective
locations. We can also live with relativization when it comes to relativistic frames
of reference. In fact, employing the Lorentz transformation between our frames,
we will be able to make precise sense of the apparent disagreement and come
to agree on the underlying objective facts about space-time.
4. Addition of structure. It is possible to add some structure to plain Minkowski
space-time that will allow the objective anchoring of a non-trivial equivalence
relation to be read, e.g., as absolute simultaneity.
In fact, nothing about the results mentioned above rules out such additions,
and Rakić [34] has shown precisely in which way an equivalence relation of
simultaneity can be added as a conservative extension to the structure of a single
Minkowski space-time.
Which of these options should a defender of presentism choose? While option (2)
seems unavailable given the importance of the notion of simultaneity, option (1) can
easily be invoked. Dialectically, however, that option is not fully satisfactory: the
defense of the present either becomes hostage to specific empirical facts about the
actual general-relativistic space-time we inhabit, or, going beyond general relativity,
the issue is deferred to a future theory of quantum gravity about which there is no
consensus yet. It would be better to provide a different response, and that is what
we will try in this paper. In fact, we will provide two different responses, one based
on option (3) and one based on option (4), which are geared towards two different
questions about the present that are mostly run together, but which need to be kept
apart.
As already stated in the introduction, the notion of the present plays a double role,
one static and one dynamic. Terminologically, we will distinguish the two relations
that characterize these two different roles as simultaneity vs. co-presentness. We hold
that these relations both have to be equivalence relations,9 but they need not be the
same.
Simultaneity characterizes the present as the time of now, indicating a temporal
location. Present events in this static sense are those that are simultaneous with now,
having the same temporal coordinate. This static role of the present has no immediate
metaphysical or ontological import, and it should therefore not be the target of our
9 We therefore do not discuss the strategy of denying that the relevant notions of simultaneity or copresentness have to be equivalence relations. This strategy is followed by many proponents of an extended
present, such as [18] or [2], who allow for overlapping but distinct nows, which implies a failure of
transitivity.
Dialectically, denying the requirement of an equivalence relation comes with an additional burden of justification, and so it will be good if we can avoid it.

123

649

modeling efforts in defense of presentism. In our view, the present in the sense of the
time coordinate of now can be fully accounted for by the relativizing strategy (3), making it a matter of perspective. The dependence on a concrete being’s rest frame is not
problematic, as full agreement in communication can be ensured. As relativity theory
poses no obstacle to defining an observer-relative notion of simultaneity anchoring
the static present, we will not comment further on the notion of simultaneity here.10
Co-presentness, on the other hand, characterizes the present as that which is currently (now) real, indicating an objective, dynamic boundary between the fixed past
and the open future of possibilities. These modal notions have ontological import and
must not be relativized to an observer or an agent.11 Considering the above list of
options, it is clear, therefore, that we need to invoke option (4): Additional formal
structure over and above that provided by a single Minkowski space-time is needed to
define a dynamic relation of co-presentness among events.
Rakić’s strategy of adding an equivalence relation to the basic structure of a single
space-time is one route that might be used to anchor a dynamic relation of copresentness. Following that recipe, one arrives at a relation that can in fact fulfill
both the static and the dynamic requirements on a notion of the present: Rakić’s [34]
result allows for a foliation of Minkowski space-time into space-like hypersurfaces to
be added conservatively, and events on the same hypersurface can then be taken to be
both simultaneous and co-present. While this may be an advantage, one might also be
critical of the combination, as there is a price to be paid: first, there can be no empirical
test of the chosen equivalence relation, and second, one undercuts the independently
motivated strategy (3) of accounting for the static (coordinate) notion of simultaneity
via relativization to a speaker’s rest frame.12
In what follows we will work towards a different objective notion of dynamic copresentness that is fully anchored in the modal notions of fixed past vs. open future. This
relation will generally not work as a static relation of simultaneity, as the region of copresentness will normally be extended both spatially and (coordinate-)temporally. The
formal resources will be provided by the framework of branching space-times, which
represents local indeterminism via sets of so-called transitions. Before we introduce
that framework in Sect. 3, we first have to argue that the notion of an extended dynamic
present makes good sense.

2 Making Room for an Extended Dynamic Present
The dynamic role of time is to account for the possibility of dynamic change, both with
respect to which things exist and what their properties are. Change in that sense needs to
be contrasted with so-called Cambridge change, which is just a thing’s having different
properties at (or with respect to) different temporal locations. Dynamic change must be
10 See Müller [23, §2] for formal details of how to work out the mentioned relativization.
11 See, e.g., Gödel [15, 258n], who says that “existence by its nature is something absolute”, or Prior [33,

p. 50], who insists that “you can’t have a thing existing from one point of view but not from another”.
12 In fact, such an attempt would then involve an error theory: speakers who posit the present of their rest
frame as the objective present would generally fail to identify the true objective notion of simultaneity, but
would have no empirical means to find out about this.

123

650

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:644–664

more than that if it really requires a dynamic notion of time, because the static notion
of temporal location is sufficient to account for Cambridge change. It is, however,
notoriously difficult to spell out what dynamic change amounts to.
As announced, in this paper we will explore a radical view of dynamic change:
change as the indeterministic realization of one option from among a set of alternatives.
Such indeterministic happenings clearly amount to change: if a radium atom decays,
or if you choose to have tea rather than coffee for breakfast, or if a cat jumps to catch a
bird, these are indeterministic events that did not have to happen, and their occurrence
makes a difference to what the world is like, realizing one possibility for the future in
contrast to all the others.
Given this indeterministic notion of dynamic change, we need a corresponding
dynamic notion of time to anchor the indeterministic realization of possibilities. In a
second radical move, we will explore the view that just as dynamic time is necessary
for real change, so real change is necessary for real, dynamic time: No change without
time, but also no time without change. In this way, we strongly dissociate the static
notion of coordinate time (temporal location) from the dynamic notion of real time.
This makes room for yet another move that may be perceived to be radical: we will
allow a moment of real time to be extended not just spatially, but also coordinatetemporally.
Our view needs to be distinguished sharply from other theories of an “extended
present” that are neither based on indeterminism, nor on a distinction between static
(coordinate) and dynamic (indeterministic) time. Taking into account indeterministic
change, we have at our disposal a richer background on which to define dynamic time.
This allows us to hold on to (dynamic) co-presentness as an equivalence relation, in
contradistinction to theories that posit overlapping present moments [2,18]. Before
we show how, we first comment on the consequences of the assumption that there is
no dynamic time without indeterministic change.
2.1 Determinism: No Real Change, No Dynamic Time
If real time and real change presuppose indeterminism, it follows that there is no
real change, and no real time, in a deterministic world. This may seem outrageous.
Take a simple deterministic world, modeled via a single Newtonian space-time, in
which a number of point particles move about on continuous trajectories. If initial
conditions are properly chosen, so that there are no three-particle collisions or other
problematic configurations, the motion of the particles in such a world may indeed
be without physically possible alternatives, thus witnessing determinism. According
to our approach, we have to say that in such a world, there is no real, indeterministic
change. Never is there a non-trivial range of options from among which only one is
realized; there is always and everywhere just one single option to begin with. But the
particles in that world move around, changing their absolute as well as their relative
locations. Surely that amounts to change in that world?
Given the distinctions we are making, we can agree that such a world harbours
Cambridge change: the particles have different locations at different times. But from
a dynamic perspective, nothing is really happening. The temporal coordinate is just

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:644–664

651

like another spatial coordinate, along which there can of course be some variation
of the configuration of the particles. But it is all just one four-dimensional block
without any real dynamics. Everything is accounted for by four-dimensional geometry.
From the point of view of dynamic time, every event in the whole deterministic fourdimensional space-time is co-present with every other event (and with itself, of course).
The dynamic present of the deterministic world is maximally extended to the whole
space-time block.13
Matters are different once one introduces indeterminism. Are we warranted to do
so? The matter is certainly controversial, and we cannot hope to provide a refutation
of determinism in a few lines here. As so often in philosophy, the issue is one of which
package deal one is willing to accept. Our dialectics runs as follows: If one is willing
to accept a distinction of a static vs. a dynamic aspect of the present, and if one is
willing to entertain the idea that dynamic time passes iff there is dynamic change iff
there are indeterministic happenings, then the assumption of determinism amounts to
a sceptical position: while we undoubtedly experience the world as dynamical in time,
there is nothing in reality to back that experience. We believe that such scepticism
is unwarranted, especially given the fundamental role of quantum indeterminism in
current technological realizations of randomness. Our package deal is coherent, and it
appears to us to be fruitful. One may start differently, of course. Following the Bohmian
program of providing a deterministic version of quantum mechanics, one starts from
a strong a priori assumption of determinism and tries to rework the existing physical
theory of quantum mechanics in its light, tackling significant formal and conceptual
obstacles along the way (see, e.g., [20]). In our view, that program still has to prove its
fuitfulness, but the matter is certainly controversial (see, e.g., [14]). That said, we will
stick with the assumption that indeterminism is available as a resource, and proceed
to show what can be done with it.14
Before we describe the indeterministic theory of branching space-times that provides all the resources we need for our definition of the dynamic, spatio-temporally
extended present, we briefly discuss what an extended present looks like in a simpler
theory of indeterministic branching histories that lacks a spatial dimension.
2.2 Branching Histories Without a Spatial Dimension
The theory of so-called branching time (BT) was formally developed by Prior [31],
following an exchange about his earlier book, Time and modality [30], with Kripke
13 William James offers a strong image of determinism depriving the world of dynamics: “The whole is
in each and every part, and welds it with the rest into an absolute unity, an iron block, in which there can
be no equivocation or shadow of turning” [19]. A similar position is advocated by Whitrow [42, 295f]: “If,
for the strict determinist, the future is merely ‘the hidden present’, whence comes the illusion of temporal
succession? The fact of transition and ‘becoming’ compels us to recognize the existence of an element of
indeterminism and irreducible contingency in the universe.”
14 We do not claim that this approach is wholly new. Our claim is, rather, that we can work out the
approach in a formally precise way. Reichenbach [36, p. 276] already argues that “[t]he distinction between
the indeterminism of the future and the determinism of the past has found, in the end, an expression in the
laws of physics”, namely, in quantum mechanics, and claims that “[t]he consequences for the time of our
experience […] are evident” (ibid.). He also advocates an indexical (or, as he says, “token-reflexive”, 277)
treatment of the passage of time.

123

(see [29]). Formally, the theory accounts for indeterminism as the tree-like branching
of linear temporal histories (chronicles). Within a BT structure, branching occurs at socalled choice points, which are maximal in the intersection of histories. The elements
of the structure are called moments. In BT, space is not formally represented. Each
moment thus comprises all of space, as a momentary super-event. We provide the
necessary definitions:
Definition 1 (BT structure) A BT structure M, < is a partial order, i.e., a non-empty
set M of moments with a relation < on M that is antisymmetric (∀x, y ∈ M [x <
y → y < x]) and transitive (∀x, y, z ∈ M [(x < y ∧ y < z) → x < z]), that is also
left-linear (∀x, y, z ∈ M [(x < z ∧ y < z) → (x  y ∨ y < x)]) and jointed (any
two elements have a greatest common lower bound).
Definition 2 (Histories) Given a BT structure M, <, the set Hist of histories is the
set of maximal linear subsets of M. Given m ∈ M, we write Hm for the set of histories
containing m.
Figure 1 illustrates a BT structure with six histories. The partial ordering relation
connects moments in the tree in the upward direction. Left-linearity of the ordering
means that branching can happen only in the upward direction, like in a real tree.
Histories are maximal linear paths through the branching tree, running from the root
at the bottom to the tip of one of the branches on top.15 Given left-linearity, histories are
closed downward: if m ∈ h for some h ∈ Hist and m  m, then m ∈ h as well. The
branching or splitting of histories allows for the representation of local indeterminism
in a BT structure. Here is the formal definition:
Definition 3 (Undividedness, splitting, choice point) Two histories h 1 , h 2 ∈ Hm are
undivided at m iff their intersection h 1 ∩ h 2 contains a moment m > m (strictly above
m); we write h 1 ≡m h 2 . Otherwise we say that h 1 , h 2 ∈ Hm split at m; we write
h 1 ⊥m h 2 . Such a moment is a choice point, and is maximal in h 1 ∩ h 2 .
It is not difficult to prove that undividedness-at-m is an equivalence relation on the
set Hm of histories containing m. Accordingly, there is a partition of Hm induced by
≡m , the elementary possibilities open at m, for which we write m . The choice points
in M are exactly those moments at which that partition is non-trivial, i.e., for which
m = {Hm }. Belnap [5] has provided a useful dynamic reading of the realization
of one of the possibilities open at a choice point, invoking the notion of a transition.
Generally, a transition consists of an initial I followed by an outcome O, for which we
write I  O. In the case of a choice point c as initial, the basic outcomes correspond
exactly to the elements of the partition c : any moment in the partial ordering that
comes after c belongs to one or more of the histories in the set Hc , and that set is
partitioned by c . Thus, the basic indeterministic event c gives rise to one of the
possible outcomes represented by c . Accordingly, we can write a basic transition
as
τ = c  H,

H ∈ c .

15 The definitions are chosen in such a way that a BT structure may be discrete, as often assumed in
computer science applications, or continuous, as in physics applications. In a continuous structure, there
does not have to be a first moment, and histories need not have last moments either.

One can define a natural ordering among the transitions, as follows:
Definition 4 (Transition ordering) Given two transitions τ1 = m 1  H1 , τ2 = m 2 
H2 , we say that τ1 precedes τ2 , written τ1 ≺ τ2 , iff (i) m 1 < m 2 and (ii) H2 ⊆ H1 .
Transitions have recently been used by Rumberg [37] to provide a novel semantics
for formal languages based on branching time; that paper contains a good overview
of the theory of transitions in branching time.
In a branching time structure, each moment m has a unique past (by left-linearity
of the ordering, there is no backward branching). The indeterministic structure of
that past consists exactly of the transitions from choice points c < m to those basic
outcomes that keep the possibility of m’s occurrence open. Given c < m, there is,
provably, always exactly one such transition, for which we write c  c m. We
thus define the set of m-enabling transitions, TR(m), as follows:
TR(m) =d f {c  c m | c < m, c a choice point}.
It is easy to prove that these transitions form a chain (a linearly ordered set) with
respect to the natural transition ordering ≺. Along that chain, the bundle of histories
becomes smaller at each indeterministic step: the occurrence of an indeterministic
transition implies the exclusion of alternative histories.16 See Fig. 1 for illustration.
2.3 The Extended Present in Branching Time
Given the formal background of branching time, we have at our hands a precise
candidate definition of real time: time passes at exactly those moments that are choice
points. At other moments, there is no indeterminism, no dropping off of histories, no
realization of one possibility in contrast to others, no real change, and therefore no
passing of dynamic time. Of course, as stressed above, static (coordinate) time also
16 As we said in Sect. 1, in this paper we do not attempt to model any additional dynamics of the passage
of time, assuming that an indexical treatment of the “dropping off of histories” is appropriate for our
communication purposes.

123

654

passes at other moments.17 As dynamic time passes only at choice points, it follows
that any stretch of moments between two choice points counts as co-present. Formally,
we define co-presentness via the indeterministic past:
Definition 5 (Co-presentness in BT) Moments m 1 , m 2 ∈ M are co-present, written
m 1 ∼ m 2 , iff TR(m 1 ) = TR(m 2 ).
As this definition is based on an identity, the relation ∼ among the moments of M is
clearly an equivalence relation.
We can show that co-present moments must be members of exactly the same histories.
Fact 1 Let m 1 ∼ m 2 , and let h ∈ Hm 1 . Then h ∈ Hm 2 as well.
Proof Assume for reductio that m 1 ∼ m 2 and h ∈ Hm 1 , but m 2 ∈
/ h. We distinguish
three cases.
(1) m 2  m 1 . This is impossible, as histories are closed downward.
(2) m 1 < m 2 . In this case, m 2 ∈ h for some h = h, and as the ordering is jointed,
there has to be a choice point c ∈ h ∩h at which h ⊥c h . We have m 1  c < m 2
and h ∈
/ c m 2 . It follows that (c  c m 2 ) ∈ TR(m 2 ) \ TR(m 1 ), i.e.,
m1  m2.
(3) m 1 and m 2 are incomparable. In this case, as the ordering M, < is jointed,
there is a greatest common lower bound c of m 1 and m 2 , and it cannot be
that c = m 1 or c = m 2 (this would lead to case (1) or (2)). It follows that
(c  c m i ) ∈ TR(m i ) (i = 1, 2), but c m 1  = c m 2 , so that again,
m1  m2.


The other direction holds as well, so that we have at our hands an alternative
definition of co-presentness in BT:
Fact 2 We have m 1 ∼ m 2 iff Hm 1 = Hm 2 .
Proof The “⇒” direction has just been proved. For “⇐”, let m 1  m 2 . Note that for
any m ∈ M, we have Hm = ∩(cH )∈TR(m) H . (We leave the proof of this step as an
exercise.) This implies Hm 1 = Hm 2 : we have TR(m 1 ) = TR(m 2 ) by assumption, and
by the linear ordering of the TR, this implies that either TR(m 1 ) and TR(m 2 ) contain
incompatible transitions from a choice point, so that Hm 1 ∩ Hm 2 = ∅, or one of the
sets of transitions extends the other, which implies that Hm 1  Hm 2 (or the other way
round).


Summing up, in BT, we can define an indeterminism-based notion of dynamic time
via the indeterministic past of moments, or alternatively via the set of histories that
17 It is often even possible to define clock times (so-called instants) across different branches, so that there
can be a formally well-defined meaning for assertions like “I could be in Venice now”, which refer to
a contemporaneous (same clock-time) moment on a different, non-actual history. While the definition of
clock times is easy in discrete orderings (in which one only has to count the moments after a choice point),
the matter is quite subtle for continuous orderings. See Belnap et al. [10, Ch. 8] for some pertinent remarks
on sufficient conditions.

the moments belong to. The non-overlapping regions of co-presentness are exactly
those intervals on the tree of branching histories that lie between two consecutive
choice points. Unless every moment is a choice point, some regions of dynamic copresentness contain more than one moment. So, the dynamic present in BT is generally
extended in static coordinate time, and thereby, the two notions of static and dynamic
time come apart. See Fig. 2 for illustration.

3 Branching Space-Times and Modal Correlations
Branching space-times (BST) makes the idea of branching histories compatible with
relativistic space-time. BST combines two differently motivated partial orders: on
the one hand, there is the causal partial ordering of space-time, e.g., the Minkowski
ordering of special relativity. On the other hand, there is an indeterministic partial
ordering, as in BT, which anchors local possibilities for the future. These two orderings
are combined via Belnap’s ingenious definition of a BST history as a maximal directed
set18 : in BST, two elements of the ordering, possible point events, belong to one history
if and only if that history contains a common upper bound for them, which provides a
perspective from which both of them have occurred. In this way, histories are generally
not linear chains of moments as in BT, but can be full space-times. The BST partial
ordering glues together several such possible histories at choice points.19
An important feature of the spatio-temporal nature of the BST ordering is that two
histories can split at different events. Such events then have to be space-like related:
18 The initial paper proposing BST is [4]. The combination of the partial orders is nicely explained in [9].
See also the pertinent chapters of [25].
19 In what follows, we will ignore the topological peculiarities of this global construction. See [24] and [28]

for discussion. The main point to stress is that the individual histories, which represent physical space-times,
do not exhibit any unorthodox topological features.

once two histories have split, they remain split; this is the BST equivalent of the BT
notion of “no backward branching”. For illustration, consider Fig. 3, which depicts
Alice (a) and Bob (b) each performing an indeterministic experiment in space-like
separation. The individual histories each represent a two-dimensional space-time with
V-shaped light cones above a and b, which are the sets of events in the respective history that are above a (or b, respectively) in the BST ordering. Each of the experiments
(idealized coin tosses, or photons passing a beam splitter) conducted at a and at b has
two immediate possible outcomes, + and −. Assuming that the two experiments are
uncorrelated (an assumption that will be lifted below), there are four combined possibilities, which we can write mnemonically as a + b+, a + b−, a − b+, and a − b−.20
These four combined possibilities correspond to four BST histories, h ++ , h +− , h −+ ,
and h −− , which are glued together at the point events a and b. These two point events
occur in all the four histories, and they are the choice points at which the histories
split. Histories h ++ and h +− split at the choice point b: it is the outcome b+ vs. b−
that separates the two histories. Histories h ++ and h −− , on the other hand, split at the
two choice points a and b, as both these choice points have different outcomes.
A consequence of multiple space-like choice points is that the respective choices
might be coordinated: in BST, there is room for space-like modal correlations. That is,
with respect to the set-up of Alice and Bob described above, there might be less than
four resulting histories. For example, the outcomes at a and at b might be perfectly
anticorrelated, leaving only two combined outcomes, a + b− and a − b+ (see Fig. 4).
20 These possibilities are thus given via maximal consistent sets of transitions, to be defined below.

123

657

There is ample empirical evidence that coordinated indeterministic events exist.21
Such coordination could be strict, as in Fig. 4, in which expected possibilities (combinatorially possible histories) are completely absent, or it could be probabilistic,
preserving the underlying full space of possibilities but showing probabilistic correlations between space-like separated events. The gist of Einstein et al.’s complaint
against the supposed completeness of orthodox quantum mechanics was to point out
that quantum mechanics predicts the space-like coordination of experimental outcomes due to entanglement in multi-partite systems [13]. Their initial example had
a modal flavor (concerning predictions that can be made with certainty), but many
subsequent examples involve just probabilistic correlations. In this paper we stick to
the modal case for simplicity’s sake.
The worry that quantum mechanics might be incomplete prompted the search for
so-called hidden variables as completions of the quantum-mechanical description of
reality, sometimes also with a view to providing a deterministic reading of the theory. Many classes of hidden variables would be detectable experimentally, as shown
by research starting with Bell [3]. Experiments have vindicated the predictions of
orthodox quantum mechanics to astonishing accuracy (see, e.g., [17]).
The formal apparatus of BST allows one to define a formally precise notion of
space-like modal correlations.22 We give a brief overview of the basic definitions of
BST theory, referring to [4,9] for more details and motivation.23
A chain in a partial ordering is a linearly ordered subset (i.e., a subset in which any
two elements are comparable). The notion of a history, which is invoked in the clauses
of Definition 6, is provided by Definition 7.
Definition 6 (BST structure) A branching space-times structure is a non-empty partial
ordering W , < of possible point events that fulfills the following conditions:
• The ordering is dense and without maxima or minima.
• The ordering is continuous in the following sense: each lower bounded chain in W
has an infimum in W , and each upper bounded chain in W has a supremum-in-h
for each history h to which the chain belongs.
• The prior choice principle: if a lower bounded chain O belongs fully to history h 1
but not at all to history h 2 (O ⊆ h 1 \ h 2 ), then there is a choice point c < O that
is maximal in the intersection of h 1 and h 2 .
Definition 7 (BST histories) A directed set is a subset D ⊆ W such that for any
e1 , e2 ∈ D there is some e3 ∈ D for which e1  e3 and e2  e3 .
The set Hist of histories is the set of maximal directed subsets of W . Given e ∈ W ,
we write He for the set of all histories containing e.
21 See Sect. 2.1 for our dialectical defense of assuming indeterminism in the first place.
22 BST also allows one to tackle space-like probabilistic correlations. See, e.g., [22] and [16]. To repeat,

we stick with modal correlations for simplicity’s sake.
23 We simplify a little here: In Definition 6, the exclusion of minima and maxima is for convenience’s
sake only. There is also a further condition that needs to be added to allow for the introduction of spatiotemporal locations across histories, Weiner’s postulate. We omit it here to keep matters simple. See [22] for
discussion.

658

Two histories h 1 , h 2 ∈ He are undivided at e iff their intersection h 1 ∩ h 2 contains
an event e > e; we write h 1 ≡e h 2 . Otherwise, e is maximal in h 1 ∩ h 2 , and the two
histories h 1 , h 2 ∈ He split at e; we write h 1 ⊥e h 2 , and e is a choice point for h 1 , h 2 .
As in the case of BT, undividedness-at-e is an equivalence relation on He ; the
respective partition of the set of histories He is written e . The definition of a basic
transition also carries over from BT; such a transition is of the form
τ = e  H,

H ∈ e .

Basic indeterministic transitions, for which e = {He }, are the irreducible elements
of indeterminism in a BST structure.
In our discussion of BT, we defined a notion of the indeterministic past of a moment
m, via the set of transitions in that moment’s past, TR(m). In BST, there are two
corresponding notions. First, generally, given an event e, there is the set of cause-like
loci for the occurrence of e. These are initials of transitions that make a difference
as to the occurrence of e, i.e., at these events, all histories containing e split off from
some history not containing e.
Definition 8 (Cause-like locus) Event c is a cause-like locus for e, c ∈ cll(e), iff there
is some h ∈
/ He for which h ⊥c He (i.e., for which for all h ∈ He , we have h ⊥c h ) .
In BT, the cause-like loci of a moment necessarily have to lie in its past, allowing
for an easy introduction of the set of enabling transitions of a moment, TR(m), in
Sect. 2.2. In BST however, due to the possibility of modal correlations, it may be that
a cause-like locus for an event e is space-like related to e. Consider event e in h +− of
Fig. 4: by the above definition, using h = h −+ and noting that He = {h +− }, we have
cll(e) = {a, b}, but while a < e, the other cause-like locus, b, is space-like related to
e.
One can therefore consider a narrower class of events making a difference to the
occurrence of e, namely, those cause-like loci that lie in the past of e.
Definition 9 (Past cause-like locus) Event c is a past cause-like locus for e, c ∈ pcl(e),
iff c ∈ cll(e) and c < e.
Barring certain infinite set-ups, which will not play a role in this paper, modal
correlations are present in a BST structure iff for some event e, there is a cause-like
locus that does not lie in e’s past, i.e., iff we have cll(e) = pcl(e) for some e.24
For a cause-like locus c ∈ pcl(e) that lies in the past of an event e, its contribution
to enabling the occurrence of e is easy to describe: one can prove that if c < e, there
is exactly one basic outcome H ∈ c that is compatible with e, and indeed, we then
have He ⊆ H . In the presence of modal correlations, however, more than one basic
outcome of a cause-like locus c ∈ cll(e) may be compatible with the event e, and so
there will be no unique basic transition from c to one of c’s immediate basic outcomes
that can be singled out via e. Still, there is a usefull general definition that covers both
cases:
24 See Belnap [6,7] for a number of equivalent characterizations of modal correlations, which he calls
“modal funny business”. For the mentioned infinite cases, see [26].

659

Definition 10 (Enabling outcome; enabling transition) Given some event e and some
c ∈ cll(e), we define the e-enabling outcome of c, written c e, to be
c e =d f


{H ∈ c | H ∩ He = ∅}.

The e-enabling transition from c is c  c e.
In case c < e, as we have just remarked, c e ∈ c , so that the enabling transition
c  c e is a basic indeterministic transition. If c < e, on the other hand, that
transition may be non-basic. Still, it is generally the case that He ⊆ c e for any
c ∈ cll(e). Therefore, even a non-basic transition c  c e properly fulfills the role
of enabling the occurrence of the event e.
Fact 3 Let c ∈ cll(e). Then He ⊆ c e.
Proof Let c ∈ cll(e), and let h ∈ He . By the definition of cll, there is some h for
which h ⊥c He , so in particular, h ⊥c h. It follows that h ∈ Hc , so there is some
basic outcome H ∈ c (which partitions Hc ) for which h ∈ H . So h ∈ H ∩ He , i.e.,


h is a witness for H ∩ He = ∅. By Def. 10, therefore, h ∈ c e.
Generally, the cause-like loci of an event e allow us to define the set of those
indeterministic (basic and perhaps also non-basic) transitions that together enable the
occurrence of e, the event’s causae causantes (see [8]):
Definition 11 (Causae causantes) The causae causantes (originating indeterministic
causes) of an event e are those transitions from cause-like loci of e that enable the
occurrence of e in the sense of Definition 10:
CC(e) =d f {c  c e | c ∈ cll(e)}.
The causae causantes are the BST generalization of the enabling transitions of a
moment, TR(m), that were defined in Sect. 2.2 in the context of BT.

4 Defining an Extended Dynamic Present in BST
In our discussion of BT we found that we could define a sensible notion of the extended
dynamic present among the set of moments in two equivalent ways, either via sameness
of the indeterministic past of the moments, or via sameness of the set of histories in
which the moments occur.
Given the resources of BST, we can show that the same two approaches are available,
and that they also characterize the same equivalence relation on the set of events, even
in the presence of modal correlations. Based on modal correlations, we can provide
BST structures in which the dynamic present extends arbitrarily far.
Our official definition of co-presentness is in terms of the indeterministic enabling
conditions expressed via an event’s causae causantes.

Definition 12 (Co-presentness in BST) Events e1 , e2 ∈ W are co-present, written
e1 ∼ e2 , iff CC(e1 ) = CC(e2 ).
Being based on an equality, the relation ∼ is clearly an equivalence relation on W . It is
well-defined no matter whether there are modal correlations or not, by the generality
of Definition 11.
In BT we could show that there is an alternative way of characterizing ∼ in terms
of sameness of histories. An analogue of Fact 2 holds in BST as well:
Fact 4 We have e1 ∼ e2 iff He1 = He2 .
Proof “⇐”: For this direction is suffices to check that the definition of cll(e), of c e,
and of CC(e) only make use of He , not of e in isolation. Thus, sameness of set of
histories implies sameness of causae causantes, and thereby, co-presentness according
to Definition 12.
“⇒”: For this direction, we show that the set of histories He in which an event e
occurs can be expressed via its causae causantes CC(e), which, to recall, are transitions of the form c  c e for c ∈ cll(e). We show that for any e ∈ W ,
He =



c e.

Given (*), from e1 ∼ e2 , i.e., CC(e1 ) = CC(e2 ), we immediately have He1 = He2 .
To establish (*), note first that the “⊆” direction follows directly from Fact 3. For
“⊇”, take some h ∈
/ He and some h ∈ He . As e ∈ h \ h, by the prior choice
principle there is some c∗ < e for which h ⊥c∗ h , and as c∗ < e, in fact h ⊥c∗ He ,
so that c∗ ∈ cll(e), and c∗ e ∈ c∗ is a basic outcome of c∗ . As e ∈ h , we
/ c∗ e. Thus, a fortiori,
havec∗ e = c∗ h , and as h ⊥c∗ h , we have h ∈

This is a welcome result: even though BST allows for modal correlations, there are
still two differently motivated definitions of co-presentness that characterize the same
relation.25
A typical shape of a region of co-presentness in the absence of modal correlations
is shown in Fig. 5.
Modal correlations allow for more extended regions of co-presentness. A pertinent
example is shown in Fig. 6. The generalization to larger sets of correlated choice points
is suggestive: if many space-like related, modally correlated choice points exist, a
region of co-present events can extend arbitrarily far.
25 One might perhaps criticize our definition because in the presence of modal correlations, it allows for

events to be co-present while their obvious alternatives fail to be co-present. For a pertinent example,
consider two ternary (outcomes 1, 2, 3) choice-points whose 1-outcomes are strictly correlated, while the
2- and 3-outcomes are uncorrelated, leading to the five (instead of nine) histories h 11 , h 22 , h 23 , h 32 , h 33 .
Here events in the 1–1-outcomes count as co-present (they all occur exactly in history h 11 ), but alternative
events in the 2–2-outcomes do not count as co-present. We are not aware of a thorough discussion of whether
the dynamic present should be modally robust, and we do not view the mentioned situation as a failure of
our definition. In any case, there is a straightforward sharpening of our definition available under which the
1–1-events would count as co-present only if there are fully strict correlations (only three histories, e.g.,
h 11 , h 22 , h 33 ): One has to demand not just that He1 = He2 , but also that e1 = e2 .

In BST, any history h ∈ Hist is a space-time. The restriction of ∼ to h is also
an equivalence relation. That equivalence relation is (barring the deterministic onehistory case) neither the identity nor the universal relation.26 We can sum up this
result as a Theorem that shows that we have indeed reached our goal: we have defined a
non-frame-dependent, non-trivial equivalence relation of co-presentness on relativistic
space-times, based on spatio-temporal indeterminism.
For full precision, let us call a BST structure featureless if either (i) it contains just
a single history (i.e., no indeterminism), or (ii) it has at least one history consisting
wholly of choice points and in which there are no modal correlations. Our Theorem
then reads as follows:
Theorem 1 Let W , < be a BST structure that is not featureless. Then for any history
h ∈ Hist(W ), the relation of co-presentness ∼ restricted to h, ∼|h , is a non-trivial
26 To be precise, indeterminism only rules out the universal relation. The identity relation would result if
every event were a choice point and there were no modal correlations. We will not speculate whether that
could be a live option and simply leave identity by the wayside.

equivalence relation on h, i.e., neither the identity nor the universal relation on h,
defined wholly in terms of the relativistically sound basic notions of BST.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have tried a novel approach to defining an ontologically fundamental
notion of co-presentness that does not go against the tenets of relativity theory. Such
a notion could be used by presentists to strengthen their case that the doctrine of the
present as the real (and the past and the possible future as unreal) does not go against
modern physics. We have not worked out a full theory of presentism here. Rather,
our investigation has focused on providing relativistically tenable formal foundations
for presentism, culminating in Theorem 1, which states that given the resources of
branching space-times, it is possible to define a non-trivial equivalence relation of
co-presentness on relativistic space-time structures.
After a survey of possible reactions to the problem of the present in relativity theory, we made a terminological distinction between a static role of the present, which
is served by the relation of simultaneity, and a dynamic role of the present, with the
corresponding relation of co-presentness. Both of these relations need to be equivalence relations, but they need not coincide. We argued that simultaneity, the sharing
of a temporal coordinate, does not by itself have any fundamental ontological import,
so that a relativizing strategy with respect to simultaneity seems promising. Such a
strategy is well served by remarking that each observer provides their own reference
frame, which is enough to guarantee successful communication in a relativistic world,
even if the observers talk about the simultaneity of distant events. The notion of copresentness, on the other hand, does have ontological import, and can therefore not
be relativized to an observer or to any other arbitrarily chosen frame. Formal results
about the definability of equivalence relations on Minkowski space-time imply that
additional structure is needed to anchor a non-trivial relation of co-presentness.
We argued that a formal representation of indeterminism can provide the needed
additional structure, and that this addition is in fact congenial to the notion of dynamic
time as requiring real (indeterministic) change. The resulting picture is one of an
extended dynamic present, implying a formal distinction between static (coordinate)
simultaneity and dynamic co-presentness. After working out the basics of our approach
in the simpler framework of branching time, we provided our full analysis in the
framework of branching space-times (BST).
Given that BST allows for modal correlations, the spatial extension of the dynamic
present can reach as far as the modal correlations do. In the limit, the dynamic present
could extend across a maximal space-like hypersurface.
Our analysis makes no predictions about the actual spatio-temporal extension of
the dynamic present, but it characterizes an interface at which empirical results about
space-like correlations could be used to provide a verdict about the size of the Now. In
our view, such a division of labor is a welcome result of the clarification of the formal
basis of an extended dynamic present.

Abstract
In this paper non-Hausdorff manifolds as potential basic objects of General Relativity are investigated. One can distinguish four stages of identifying an appropriate
mathematical structure to describe physical systems: kinematic, dynamical, physical
reasonability, and empirical. The thesis of this paper is that in the context of General
Relativity, non-Hausdorff manifolds pass the first two stages, as they enable one to
define the basic notions of differential geometry needed to pose the problem of the
evolution-distribution of matter and are not in conflict with the Einstein equations.
With regard to the third stage, various potential conflicts with physical reasonability
conditions are considered with a tentative conclusion that non-Hausdorff manifolds
are more likely to pass this stage than is typically assumed. When dealing with some
of these problems, the modal interpretation of non-Hausdorff manifolds is invoked,
according to which they represent bundles of alternative possible spacetimes rather
than single spacetimes.

1 Introduction
The topic of this paper is the mathematical properties of non-Hausdorff manifolds,
especially those that seem to be physically relevant, and the possible use of these
objects in General Relativity (GR). Most GR textbooks focus solely on manifolds
that satisfy the Hausdorff condition (defined later); typically, the term ‘manifold’ is
used as a synonym of ‘Hausdorff manifold’, and the class that encompasses both
Hausdorff and non-Hausdorff manifolds is called the class of ‘generalised manifolds’.
The main question of this paper is to what extent the standard exclusion of non-

Hausdorff manifolds from the scope of investigations in physics is justified, and if it
is justified, what the basis and conceptual significance are for such an exclusion.
Some of the crucial differences between Hausdorff and non-Hausdorff manifolds
are connected with the issue of determinism and indeterminism. Non-Hausdorff manifolds allow for two forms of indeterminism that are excluded when we impose the
Hausdorff condition: at the level of geodesics and at the level of entire spacetimes.
Therefore, it will be suggested that non-Hausdorff manifolds are better interpreted as
representing bundles of alternative possible spacetimes rather than single spacetimes,
which alleviates some of the problems associated with them.
The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, the notion of a basic object of GR is
introduced. In Sect. 3 a scheme is proposed for identifying an appropriate mathematical structure to describe physical systems, which consists of four stages: kinematic,
dynamical, physical reasonability, and empirical. In Sect. 4, it is argued that in the
case of GR, the necessary condition for passing a kinematic stage is the satisfaction
of a functional criterion, according to which a basic object of GR should provide
a mathematical framework for posing the problem of the evolution-distribution of
matter. Section 5 provides a formal definition of the Hausdorff condition and includes
definitions of the different types of manifolds (i.e. Hausdorff, non-Hausdorff, and generalised). In Sect. 6, the properties of non-Hausdorff manifolds are reviewed, which
lays the groundwork for the discussion of objections against the use of non-Hausdorff
manifolds in physics in Sect. 7. Section 8 answers these objections and concludes
that non-Hausdorff manifolds pass the kinematic and dynamical stages and that their
situation regarding the third stage is not as problematic as typically assumed. To deal
with some of the objections, the modal interpretation of non-Hausdorff manifolds is
introduced. Finally, Sect. 9 identifies two senses of modality that were involved in the
considerations discussed in the previous sections: first in connection with indeterminism and then with the four stages. Section 10 provides a short summary.

2 The Notion of the Basic Object of GR
The basic object of GR is the main object this theory is about and with respect to which
all other objects in the theory are defined. The expression ‘with respect to which all
other objects in the theory are defined’ does not mean that the basic object of GR
exhausts this theory’s content and that all other objects are defined in terms of it;
it is the much more modest claim that all other objects somehow presume it and are
defined with respect to it (or on it). Other objects that GR deals with are different types
of matter, represented either by matter fields or by point particles, both of which are
defined with respect to the basic object of GR (i.e. they are represented by functions
of spatiotemporal variables).
The term ‘basic object’ should be understood ontologically, that is, as one of the
objects to which the theory refers. Mathematically, the basic object of GR is represented by a differential manifold (perhaps with some additional structures, such as a
metric). Therefore, the necessary condition for being the basic object of GR is being
a physical counterpart of a differential manifold; however, this is likely to be not sufficient, as one can imagine using the formalism of GR to model phenomena quite

623

remote from those typical for GR. In Sect. 4, I will impose a further condition on basic
objects of GR.
The notion of the basic object of GR (or an equivalent one) is not used in the
literature,1 and there is a reason for this—it is always assumed that it is clear what the
basic object of GR is, namely: spacetime. However, the hypothesis defended here is
that spacetime is not the only possible option for a basic object of GR. In what follows,
it will be argued that if we define the basic object of GR by some minimal conditions it
should possess, then it turns out that other objects which are more naturally interpreted
as bundles of alternative possible spacetimes rather than single spacetimes belong to
this category. Therefore, to allow for both options, the more general notion of a basic
object of GR is needed.

3 Four Stages of Identifying the Appropriate Mathematical
Structures to Represent the Physical World
The aim of theoretical physics is to find mathematical structures that adequately represent physical reality. This suggests the following two-stage picture: physicists first
propose a mathematical structure, and then, via an empirical investigation, they decide
whether the structure adequately represents the physical world or a part of it. However,
this way of proceeding is not very practical, as the number of mathematical structures
is too large to try them one by one. Instead, physicists start from some set of mathematical structures and then systematically narrow it down to get the desired result.
This ‘narrowing down’ can be done on a purely empirical basis, but it can also have
a mixed, empirical-theoretical character. The first case is typical for situations where
one has a parametrised family of models; then, by fitting parameters to the available
data, some ranges of these parameters can be excluded. In the next few paragraphs,
a scheme for empirical-theoretical narrowing down is proposed, which differs from
the purely empirical one in that each stage has some conceptual (and perhaps also a
metaphysical, especially modal) significance. The scheme is as follows:
1. Kinematic stage: the choice of the basic set-up of a theory, including the space of
possible states of its objects. At this stage, no constraints in the form of equations
are imposed.
2. Dynamical stage: the choice of mathematical constraints in the form of dynamical
equations that the objects should satisfy.
1 In the context of quantum theory, there is a similar notion, namely ‘primitive ontology of a theory’, which
is said to be “what the theory is fundamentally about” [1, p. 363]. However, a closer look reveals significant
differences between the two notions, which are the consequence of differences in context and the purpose
of introducing them. Primitive ontology consists of entities living in spacetime, which are fundamental
building blocks of everything else [2, p. 60]; they should be distinguished from other objects used in a
theory, whose role is only auxiliary, such as the wave function, which does not have physical significance of
its own, but only as a tool in the description of the behaviour of the objects belonging to primitive ontology.
The role of the notion of the basic object of GR is quite different: it is not intended to capture all physically
significant objects that can be described by GR, and it is also not intended to distinguish between physically
real and auxiliary objects in a theory (or even between more fundamental and less fundamental ones); rather,
it is introduced to avoid presuming that spacetime is the only possible referent of the central mathematical
structure of GR, that is, a differential manifold.

123

3. Physical reasonability stage: the choice of additional physical reasonability conditions, which should be satisfied by the objects.
4. Empirical stage: finding the model of a theory that is realised (or approximately
realised) in the actual world.
This scheme is not supposed to be an original proposal. The distinction between
kinematically and dynamically possible models is well known and popular in the
philosophy of physics literature;2 also, the importance of physical reasonability as
providing additional constraints is recognised in the literature, especially in the context
of GR (see, e.g., [5,6]), although such conditions may appear in other theories as well.
The stages differ from each other in the following way. The kinematic stage is
distinguished by the absence of any constraints in the form of equations, which are
introduced at the second and perhaps the third stage. The dynamical stage imposes
dynamical equations (and in the relativistic case also constraints on the initial conditions associated with these dynamical equations). The physical reasonability stage
encompasses various additional constraints on the behaviour of the solutions of these
dynamical equations.
In the case of a basic object of GR, the above four stages can be specified in the
following way:
1. Kinematic stage: differential geometry as a basic set-up; basic objects of GR are
differential manifolds with metrics; matter is represented by an energy tensor.3
2. Dynamical stage: a basic object of GR should satisfy the Einstein equations.
3. Physical reasonability stage: a basic object of GR should satisfy some physical
reasonability conditions, for example, causality conditions and energy conditions;
the exact list of the conditions required is disputable.4
4. Empirical stage: addressed by observational astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.
The hierarchy of stages does not need to correspond to temporal succession in
the actual scientific work. All the stages are empirically motivated in some way, not
just the last one. Kinematics, dynamics and physical reasonability principles should
be chosen such that their defining conditions are not violated by the actual physical
world. Furthermore, physicists often investigate theories that are not mathematically
fully understood, so they may consider the equation of motion (i.e., the dynamical
stage) without explicitly specifying all the details of the space of states (i.e., the
kinematic stage).
The crucial fact is that in contrast to purely empirical narrowing down, each of
the stages in the above scheme has its own individual conceptual significance. The
elimination of certain ranges of parameters (in purely empirical narrowing down)
concerns just numbers, and its consecutive phases do not have such a clear meaning.
2 For exemplary uses of this distinction, see [3, p. 154] or [4, p. 702]. The related distinction between
kinematics and dynamics is standard in physics.
3 Strictly speaking, an energy tensor does not represent all ‘aspects’ of matter, only its properties that are
relevant for gravitational interactions; a full representation of matter is given by matter fields which possess
energy and momentum represented by this tensor.
4 The notion of physical reasonable spacetime is used in the context of GR by physicists and philosophers
of physics. For the list of potential physical reasonability conditions, see, for example, [5].

123

625

Therefore, the scheme should be read as proposing a kind of conceptual order, which
can be identified in different theoretical contexts in physics.

4 Kinematic Stage in the Case of a Basic Object of GR
To perform the first stage, some initial heuristics are required. I argue elsewhere [7]
that in the case of GR, as well as other spacetime theories, such a heuristic may be
provided by functional considerations: a basic object of GR, which is typically just
spacetime, can be defined by the function it is supposed to play with respect to other
objects in the theory, which is providing the basic framework for posing the problem
of the evolution-distribution of matter.
To elaborate on this issue, in [7], I explain in more detail how the proposed function
should be understood and the benefits of this way of thinking about spacetime theories.
Regarding the first issue, I use a non-standard notion of evolution-distribution where
the hyphen indicates that this should be understood as a single idea whose two aspects,
evolution and distribution, can be clearly distinguished only in some cases. ‘Distribution’ refers to the arrangement of matter in space, whereas ‘evolution’ refers to the
evolution in time of such an arrangement. In pre-relativistic physics (and according to
common sense), space and time are separate structures, so we can associate space with
distribution and time with evolution. However, this is no longer the case in relativistic
physics, so that is why the hyphenated term is used. The level of this inseparability
varies. In SR and globally hyperbolic solutions of GR, this separation is still possible,
but it can be done in many ways, none of which are distinguished. For solutions of
GR that are not globally hyperbolic, space and time cannot be separated even in this
weaker sense.5
The formulation of the problem of evolution-distribution of matter amounts to
providing consistent equations prescribing the evolution-distribution of matter (in
other words, the laws governing the evolution-distribution of matter) which have at
least one solution. The term ‘formulation’ should be, therefore, understood in a rather
broad manner in that it does not imply the well-posedness of an initial value problem.
In a well-posed initial value problem, the solution of the problem exists, is unique, and
depends continuously on the given initial data. No particular initial data are assumed
here, and only the first condition is imposed, which means some solutions of the
problem should exist (for at least some of the possible initial data). Why has so weak
a notion been postulated? Initial value problems that possess non-unique solutions
can be interpreted as describing indeterministic evolution. Even if there are reasons to
exclude this type of evolution, it should be done on different grounds. The bare notion
of spacetime (or, in the present consideration, a basic object of GR) is unrelated to the
issue of whether the physical world is deterministic or indeterministic, so the latter
should not be settled at the level of specifying what spacetime/a basic object of GR is.
Regarding the second issue (i.e., the benefits of the above sketched functional
approach), I argue [7] that the other functions of spacetime one can think of (e.g.,
5 Technically, this means that only globally hyperbolic manifolds allow foliations by Cauchy surfaces (see,
e.g., [8, p. 395]).

providing the localization for matter, the causal structure, and the structure of symmetries) are best understood as derivative with respect to the above explained main
function or as a part of it. Furthermore, I argue that within this approach, one can easily justify why some models of spacetime should be regarded as excessive (namely,
those that contain more structure than is needed to support the laws of the evolutiondistribution of matter) and, relatedly, why so-called symmetry-to-reality inferences
can be performed for spatiotemporal quantities.
Functional considerations do not put sufficient constraints on the theory, as the
proposed role can be played by different mathematical structures. GR is clearly not
the only known spacetime theory (and the other important theories include Classical
Mechanics and Special Relativity); in fact, most physical theories involve some ingredient that corresponds to spacetime. Therefore, some further specification is required,
and in the case of GR, this specification consists of choosing a differential geometry
framework and the basic scheme of the model of GR, namely W , gμν  (where W is
a differential manifold and gμν is a metric).
Which of the stages should be regarded as defining what a basic object of GR is?
This is to some extent a matter of terminological choice, but I suggest that the natural
answer is that the first two stages, namely kinematic and dynamical, specify what is
it to be a basic object of GR. The third stage is better understood as choosing from
among the different basic objects of GR those that are in agreement with some of the
known general features of the actual physical world (such as the general properties of
causal structure, in the case of causality conditions) rather than further specifying the
notion of a basic object of GR. This seems to be in line with the usual way of speaking:
a badly behaving GR spacetime (i.e., one violating some of the physical reasonability
conditions) is still counted as a GR spacetime; and a spacetime that is not a solution
of Einstein’s equations is not a GR spacetime (but it can be a spacetime of some other
theory).

5 Generalised Manifolds
Is the above definition of a basic object of GR (given by the requirements of kinematic
and dynamical stage) in exact accordance with physicists’ practice? Typically, the
definition of a differential manifold, which represents a basic object of GR, includes
the so-called Hausdorff condition:
Definition 1 (Hausdorff condition) For any two points p, q ∈ W , there exist open6
sets O p , Oq such that p ∈ O p , q ∈ Oq , and O p ∩ Oq = ∅.
The condition says that any two points can be separated by open sets in the sense
that we can always find two open disjoint sets, one of which includes the first point,
and the other includes the second point. This should be distinguished from the local
Euclidicity condition, according to which the neighbourhood of every point can be
mapped into a subset of Rn for some n, which is the same for all points of the manifold.
The latter is a defining condition of the manifold and is needed for the basic notions

of differential geometry to be definable; it implies the local version of the Hausdorff
condition7 but not the standard, global one as defined above.
One can consider generalised manifolds, which do not need to satisfy the Hausdorff
condition. Then, Hausdorff manifolds (satisfying the condition) and non-Hausdorff
manifolds (violating the condition) become two special cases of generalised manifolds.
This terminology will be used in what follows.
Although the Hausdorff condition seems like an abstract, purely technical constraint
on mathematical formalism, in the framework of GR, its violation has consequences
of clear physical significance. Some of these consequences led physicists to restrict
their attention to manifolds that satisfy this condition. In Sects. 6–8, I will first review
properties of non-Hausdorff manifolds and then reflect upon the issue of whether they
indeed should be excluded, and if the answer is ‘yes’, at what conceptual stage this
should be done.

6 Properties of Non-Hausdorﬀ Manifolds
This section reviews the results concerning properties of differential manifolds that
are connected with the Hausdorff condition, most of which are equivalent with this
condition. Some of these properties seem to be purely mathematical without a clear
physical interpretation, whereas some others have far-reaching physical consequences.
Let us begin with the first group of properties.
The Hausdorff condition is a topological condition, so it can be considered in the
purely topological context without taking into account differential structure. Let us
restrict our considerations to the topological context for a moment. Denote topological
manifolds8 by X and Y . In Bourbaki’s [9], Munkres’s [10], and Willard’s [11] work,
we can find the following mathematical properties that are equivalent to the Hausdorff
condition:
– Every net in X (a subset of X indexed by elements of directed set) has a unique
limit point.
– Every filter in X has a unique limit point.
– The diagonal Δ = {(x, x) : x ∈ X } is closed in X × X .
– The intersection of the closed neighbourhoods of any point of X consists of that
point alone.
There is also a group of conditions that are not equivalent to the Hausdorff condition but are absent in some non-Hausdorff manifolds and satisfied in all Hausdorff
manifolds:
7 The local version of the Hausdorff condition requires that every point has a neighbourhood that, considered
as a submanifold, satisfies the Hausdorff condition (i.e., a manifold W is said to be locally Hausdorff iff
for every point p ∈ W , there exists a neighbourhood of p which satisfies the Hausdorff condition). The
local version does not imply the global one; so, if we find a non-Hausdorff pair (i.e., a pair of points that
violate the Hausdorff condition) in a locally but not globally Hausdorff manifold, then for each member of
this pair, we can find a neighbourhood that does not include the other member of this pair and, as a whole,
satisfies the Hausdorff condition.
8 A topological manifold is a topological space X for which there exists n ∈ N such that for every point
p ∈ X , there exists a neighbourhood of p that is homeomorphic with Rn .

– Any continuous map of a topological space X into a Hausdorff space Y is uniquely
determined by its values at all points of a dense subset of X .
– If X is a Hausdorff space, then a sequence of points of X converges to at most one
point in X .
– Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.
The significance of these results for the physical viability of non-Hausdorff manifolds is not clear. For example, the fact that in Hasudorff manifolds, a continuous map
is uniquely determined by its values in a dense subset is very useful for mathematicians
as it simplifies proofs of some theorems, but, as far as the author knows, there is no
physical motivation for this property. More problematic is the lack of a unique limit
point of a net or of a sequence as it may be related to bifurcating curves. However,
the non-uniqueness of limit points and the existence of such curves are inequivalent
issues, and the latter will be analysed separately.
We have seen consequences of the Hausdorff condition for the topology of a differential manifold. What about the differential structure? It turns out that the Hausdorff
condition is not needed for defining all the basic concepts of local differential geometry. Hicks’ textbook [12] shows how all these concepts can be defined and analysed
without assuming this condition. This observation is crucial as these are precisely the
notions that are needed to pose the problem of the evolution-distribution of matter,
which suggests that there is no reason for excluding non-Hausdorff manifolds already
at the kinematic stage.
However, the Hausdorff condition does make some difference for differential manifolds, in addition to the topological properties mentioned above. Adding this condition
enables some further constructions, such as a distance function. To see this connection,
let us first define (following [12, p. 70]) the notions of pseudo-distance and distance:
Definition 2 A pseudo-metric (i.e., the pseudo-distance between points p and q) is
given by9
d( p, q) := inf {|γ | : γ is a smooth curve from p to q} ,
(1)
where


|γ | :=

(2)

s1

and ξ a is the tangent field to γ .
Definition 3 A metric (i.e., the distance between points p and q) is a pseudo-metric
that satisfies an additional condition: for every p, q ∈ W ,
d( p, q) = 0 ⇒ p = q.

(3)

If a pseudo-metric is also a metric, then it enables one to distinguish different points. If
it is not, then it is allowed that two distinct points are at the distance 0 from each other.
The connection between the Hausdorff condition and metric is given by the following
theorem [12, p. 71]:
9 This is not a general definition of a pseudo-metric, which is axiomatic, but a particular construction in
GR satisfying this definition.

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

629

Theorem 1 A connected Riemannian differential manifold W is Hausdorff iff the
pseudo-metric d is a metric.
It should be stressed that the term ‘metric’ is used here in the topological sense;
a metric in this sense is not the same as the metric tensor. The latter is clearly an
indispensable element of any model of GR; the former is not necessary, although it
may be useful in some constructions. A metric tensor, in contrast to metric in the
topological sense, does not require the Hausdorff condition to be definable; in fact,
construction of concrete examples of non-Hausdorff manifolds amounts to finding
their metric tensors (see, e.g., [13]).
Next, the results of clearer physical importance will be addressed. There are three
such results: concerning bifurcating curves, concerning the existence of the maximal
extension of a differential manifold, and concerning the relationship between the
Hausdorff condition and strong causality. To understand the first result, we first need
to define two kinds of bifurcating curves (see [14]):
Definition 4 (Bifurcate curve of the first kind) A bifurcate curve of the first kind is a
pair of curves C, C  in a manifold W , with C, C  : [0, 1] → W , such that C = C  on
[0, g] and C = C  on (g, 1] for some g ∈ (0, 1).
Definition 5 (Bifurcate curve of the second kind) A bifurcate curve of the second kind
is a pair of curves C, C  in a manifold W , with C, C  : [0, 1] → W , such that C = C 
on [0, g) and C = C  on [g, 1] for some g ∈ (0, 1].
The distinction between bifurcating curves of the first and second kind is important,
because of the following difference between them. Bifurcating curves of the first kind
appear in all differential manifolds and are regarded as unproblematic. In contrast,
bifurcating curves of the second kind appear only in very special manifolds (in a
subclass of non-Hausdorff manifolds), and some of them are bifurcating geodesics.
If one interprets geodesics as potential trajectories of free test particles (which is a
standard approach), then it is not clear how to think about the situation of particle
passing a bifurcation point. One natural interpretation is that such a point indicates an
indeterministic event: a particle needs to ‘choose’ one of the branches of a bifurcating
curve, and there is nothing in the theory that determines which branch it should take.
There are no such problems in Hausdorff manifolds, which do not allow bifurcating
curves of the second kind. However, even some of the non-Hausdorff manifolds do
not admit such curves. This issue is related to the way non-Hausdorff manifolds are
constructed from Hausdorff ones. This can be done with the use of a so-called gluing
map (see [14,15]):
Definition 6 (Gluing map) Let W1 = W1 , g1  and W2 = W2 , g2  be differential
manifolds. Then φ : U12 → U21 , where U12 ⊆ W1 , U21 ⊆ W2 , is a gluing map if
– U12 is open, and
– φ is an isometry.
One can distinguish two classes of gluing maps: those that are continuously extendible
and those that are not, where continuous extendibility is defined in the following way:

123

630

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

Definition 7 (Continuously extendible gluing) A gluing map φ : A → B, A ⊆
W1 , B ⊆ W2 is continuously extendible iff there exist A , B  , φ  such that A  A ⊆
W1 , B  B  ⊆ W2 , φ  : A → B  , φ  is continuous and φ  | A = φ.
Then, the theorem relating the existence of bifurcating curves of the second kind and
the choice of gluing is as follows [14]:
Theorem 2 The necessary and sufficient condition for a differential manifold constructed by gluing together Hausdorff differential manifolds to admit bifurcating
curves of the second kind is that the gluing be continuously extendible.
This may look like a theorem about a very special class of non-Hausdorff manifolds,
namely those constructed from Hausdorff manifolds with the use of the gluing technique. However, it may be proven [15] that any Hausdorff manifold can be constructed
this way, so the theorem turns out to be a universal criterion for distinguishing nonHausdorff manifolds admitting bifurcating curves of the second kind from those that
do not admit them.
The second physically significant property concerns the existence of a maximal
extension of a given differential manifold. Extension and maximal extension are
defined as follows:
Definition 8 (Extension, maximal extension) An extension of a differential manifold
  such that there exists an isometric embedW , gab  is a differential manifold W  , gab
  is a maximal
ding φ : W → W  satisfying φ(W )  W  . An extension W  , gab
extension if it does not admit any further extension.
Clarke’s [16] theorem states the relationship between satisfying the Hausdorff condition by a manifold and the existence of a maximal extension of that manifold:
Theorem 3 Any spacetime that is either Hausdorff or non-Hausdorff without bifurcating curves of the second kind has a maximal extension.
The lack of a maximal extension is sometimes regarded as problematic (and we
will come back to this issue later). For now, let us observe that, again, the Hausdorff
condition is not enough to get the problematic result, but an additional factor is needed,
and it is the same as in the case of the existence of bifurcating curves of the second
kind, namely the fact that the gluing (by which the manifold can be constructed) is
continuously extendible.
The third relevant theorem for our considerations concerns causal properties of
non-Hausdorff manifolds. Some of them violate so-called strong causality defined as
follows [17, p. 134]:
Definition 9 (Strong causality) A differential manifold is said to be strongly causal if
for all points p ∈ W , and all sufficiently small open sets O containing p, no smooth
future-directed timelike curve that starts in O, and leaves O, ever returns to O.
Concerning the relationship between strong causality and the Hausdorff condition,
[16] proves the following:
Theorem 4 A non-Hausdorff spacetime is either not strongly causal or admits bifurcate curves of the second kind.

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

631

If all of the analysed properties (i.e., bifurcating curves of the second kind, the lack
of a maximal extension, and the violation of strong causality) are really problematic,
then non-Hausdorff manifolds should be regarded as problematic as well because each
of them has at least one of these properties. If we restrict to non-Hausdorff manifolds
that are constructible with the use of gluing that is not continuously extendible, then we
face the problem of the violation of strong causality. However, if we restrict to nonHausdorff manifolds that are constructible with the use of continuously extendible
gluing, then we can perhaps save strong causality (although Clark’s theorem does not
guarantee that), but we have to accept bifurcating curves of the second kind (including
bifurcating geodesics) and the lack of a maximal extension. Thus, the crucial question
is whether these properties are indeed unacceptable, and if so, at which stage (among
those presented in Sect. 3) should they be taken into account.

7 Objections to the Use of Non-Hausdorﬀ Manifolds in GR
The aim of this section is to review the objections to non-Hausdorff manifolds considered in the literature, which typically lead authors to disregard such objects altogether.
It should be noted that in most of the literature, non-Hausdorff manifolds are omitted
without analysing the reasons for such a move in detail; supposedly, the implicit reason
is always one of those presented below. All of the objections refer to the properties
of non-Hausdorff manifolds analysed in the previous section. The objections are as
follows.
(i) First, there are some purely mathematical objections, referring to the failure in
non-Hausdorff manifolds of some mathematical theorems premised on the Hausdorff
condition. Objections of this type can be found in [18, pp. 199–200]:
The assumption of Hausdorffness is explicitly invoked only sporadically in textbooks on general relativity. But it is implicitly assumed in so many standard
results in GTR that dropping it would require a major rewriting of textbooks.
Here are two examples of widely used results that depend on Hausdorffness.
(i) A compact set of a topological space is closed—if the space is Hausdorff.
(ii) If a sequence of points of a topological space converges, the limit point is
unique—if the space is Hausdorff.
(ii) The main argument against non-Hausdorff manifolds refers to the presence of
bifurcating geodesics (see Theorem 2). Since geodesics are standardly assumed to be
the (potential) worldliness of free test particles, the bifurcation amounts to indeterminism. Some authors claim indeterminism is problematic, as it leads to an unacceptable
kind of arbitrariness. For example, Earman [18, p. 200] asks rhetorically, “But how
would such a particle know which branch of a bifurcating geodesic to follow?”, suggesting that there is no good answer to this question, but that there should be one. Also,
Hájíček disregards non-Hausdorff manifolds for a similar reason, namely, because they
break of the “classical causality conception coinciding with determinism” [19, p. 79].
(iii) An objection similar to (ii) concerns whole spacetimes: if we allow nonHausdorffness, then one may attach non-Haussdorffly additional branches at some

123

632

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

moment in time to each spacetime, and nothing determines which possible branch is
realised. Again, quoting Earman [18, p. 202]:
If non-Hausdorff spacetime branching is to be taken seriously, what is needed is
a physical theory that prescribes the dynamics of branching. What the advocates
of individual branching offer is not a theory but the nostrum that branching takes
place when an indeterministic process produces an outcome plus ad hoc rules,
e.g. there is branching to the future but not towards the past. (...) “outcome of
an indeterministic process” is not a term of any theory of physics but something
that needs analysis.
(iv) The fact that some non-Haussdorff differential manifolds do not have maximal
extensions, as Theorem 3 states, can also be regarded as problematic. Earman [20, pp.
32–33] claims that there are metaphysical reasons to believe that the actual spacetime
should be maximal:
Metaphysical considerations suggest that to be a serious candidate for describing
actuality, a spacetime should be maximal. For example, for the Creative Force to
actualize a proper subpart of a larger spacetime would seem to be a violation of
Leibniz’s principles of sufficient reason and plenitude. If one adopts the image
of spacetime as being generated or built up as time passes then the dynamical
version of the principle of sufficient reason would ask why the Creative Force
would stop building if it is possible to continue. However, this image does not
sit well with the four-dimensional way of thinking, and in any case it runs into
trouble in its own terms: since extensions of spacetime are generally non-unique
there may be many ways to continue building and the Creative Force may be
stymied by a Buridan’s ass choice (see Clarke [21], pp. 8, 9). Some readers may
be shocked by the introduction of metaphysical considerations in the hardest of
the “hard sciences.” But in fact leading workers in relativistic gravitation, though
they don’t invoke the name of Leibniz, are motivated by such principles (see,
for example, [14, p. 262] and [22, p. 253]).
(v) Earman’s [18] other objection concerns the local and global conservation of
energy. His argument goes as follows. To properly formulate a local conservation
law, an energy-momentum tensor should be continuous and differentiable. However,
this entails that when energy ‘travels’ along a bifurcating curve, it has to take both
branches because if it only went along one of them, the tensor on another one would
be discontinuous. However, global energy conservation would then be violated.
(vi) Additionally, all arguments in favour of strong causality are simultaneously
arguments against those non-Hausdorff manifolds that violate it (see Theorem 4). Most
of the literature dealing with causality conditions is not concerned with non-Hausdorff
manifolds, as the conditions themselves are of great significance in many other contexts
in GR. Besides strong causality, many more causality conditions are considered, and
the most important one is the chronology condition, which states that no smooth,
closed timelike curves exist. Its importance arises from the fact that the violation of
this condition raises serious interpretative problems, such as the grandfather paradox.
It seems that causal loops would enable one to intervene in the past, and the possibility

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

633

of changing the past seems to be inconsistent or at least requires very sophisticated
interpretation, for which our causal intuitions are greatly insufficient.
The chronology condition forbids a smooth timelike curve from coming back to
the exact same point, whereas strong causality forbids coming back even arbitrarily
close to that point. Although the violation of the latter does not seem to lead to causal
paradoxes, or if it does, they are at least considerably less obvious, some authors claim
that manifolds allowing such a violation should also be disregarded. For example,
Hawking [23] says,
it can be seen that, if the strong causality assumption did not hold, W would be
on the verge of violating the chronology assumption. That is to say, the slightest
disturbance of the metric (by quantum fluctuations, for instance) coud lead to the
existence of closed timelike curves. It would not seem realistic to suppose that
spacetime could judge as accurately as that to avoid a violation of chronology.
Thus it would seem physically reasonable to assume strong causality.
(vii) Finally, Penrose [22] criticises non-Hausdorff manifolds on the basis that the
only potential application of these objects in physics he regards as viable (in the
Everettian interpretation of Quantum Mechanics) has its own internal problems. Let
us analyse these objections in more detail. In [22, pp. 592–595] Penrose considers a
model in which “the branching takes place along the future light-cones of the points
at which ‘observations’ (presumably quantum-mechanical) are made”. According to
him, this model
is not altogether implausible. It is possible to envisage, for example, that the
branching accompanies a kind of retarded collapse of the wavefunction, where
on each branch the wavefunction starts out as a different eigenvector of the
operator representing the observation.
This would be, therefore, a possible model of an Everett-type universe. Then, Penrose
continues,
Such a model could be viewed as an ‘objective’ description of a world containing
some strongly ‘subjective’ elements. One could envisage different conscious
observers threading different routes through the myriads of branches (either by
chance, say, or perhaps even by the exercise of some ‘free will’).
Penrose criticises such a non-Hausdorff Everettian model. The first problem is that
no one has shown that Everettian assumptions in fact lead to such a model. However,
this objection is itself not so harmful, as it is also not shown that such a model cannot
be constructed; it amounts to saying that this is a potential project rather than a finished
theory. Another disadvantage is that this model does not seem to be able to solve the
problem of the origin of the direction of time. And Penrose’s main objection concerns
interpretative problems associated with the Everettian conception as such:
I feel particularly uncomfortable about my friends having all (presumably) disappeared down different branches of the universe, leaving me with nothing but
unconscious zombies to talk to!

123

634

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

To comment on this quote, Penrose seems to assume that new worlds in the Everettian
multiverse could be created by measurements performed by a conscious observer
(each world corresponds to one possible outcome), whose consciousness, however,
stays only in one of these worlds. In the remaining worlds, only his or her unconscious
body remains, and we have no guarantee that the consciousness of people we know
stayed in the same world as our own.

8 Answers to the Objections and the Modal Interpretation of
Non-Hausdorﬀ Manifolds
How convincing are the above objections, and what conclusions should we draw from
them? In terms of our four stages of identifying mathematical structures for physics
(discussed in Sect. 3), to what stage do they belong? As mentioned in Sect. 6, nonHausdorff manifolds enable one to define all the notions of differential geometry
needed to pose the problem of the evolution-distribution of matter, which is enough
to pass the first (kinematic) stage. Although the solution is not unique in some cases
(as bifurcating geodesics can occur, leading to non-unique trajectories of free test
particles), it does not matter at this stage because only the fact that the problem can be
formulated matters. Its more specific properties should be considered at a later (i.e.,
the third) stage. With regard to the dynamical stage, nothing in the Einstein equations
prohibits the occurrence of non-Hausdorff manifolds, so they can also pass this stage
if the stress-energy tensor Tμν is appropriately chosen. Therefore, it seems that if nonHausdorff manifolds were to be excluded, this should be done at the third or fourth
stage. In fact, all of the arguments reviewed in Sect. 7 are associated with the third
stage. Concerning the fourth stage, very little can be said. Currently, no successful
usage of non-Hausdorff manifolds to represent some physical situation is known, and
proposing such a model is beyond the scope of this paper.
The aim of this section is to discuss whether the presented objections are strong
enough to lead to the judgement that non-Hausdorff manifolds do not pass the third
stage. This is particularly difficult, as the criteria here are not clear: there are different
ideas of what counts as physical reasonability conditions, and satisfying some of them
does not imply that the others are satisfied as well, so they should be considered case
by case. Therefore, the following analysis should be regarded as rather provisional.
Ad (i): First, observe that the two properties Earman mentions are not equivalent
to the Hausdorff property, but only implied by it, so it is not the case that all nonHausdorff spacetimes violate them. Second, and more importantly, as was suggested
in Sect. 6, it is not clear whether these mathematical facts have a physical significance
on their own. If they are important because they are connected with some more physical
features of non-Hausdorff manifolds, such as the presence of bifurcating geodesics,
then these physical features, and not the mathematical facts mentioned by Earman,
form the proper basis of the argument against non-Hausdorff manifolds.
An alternative reading of Earman’s quote could be that the crucial thing is not the
particular mathematical theorems mentioned by him, but a general fact (of a rather
practical nature) that all the available literature assumes the Hausdorff condition and,
therefore, we would be unable to recover the results that are important for scientific

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

635

practice if we dropped it. However, this is not the case—although most of the literature
on the subject indeed assumes the Hausdorff condition, not all textbooks do this. For
example, as previously mentioned, [12] introduces all the basic notions of differential
geometry without assuming the Hausdorff condition and starts using it substantially
no earlier than in chapter 6 of his book.
Before we move on to the next objection, we should recall the exact relationship between non-Hausdorff manifolds and bifurcating geodesics. As Theorem 2
states, some non-Hausdorff manifolds do not admit bifurcating curves of the second kind (some of which may be bifurcating geodesics). Interestingly, most of the
non-Hausdorff manifolds considered in the existing literature are of this type, for
example, extensions of Misner spacetime and extensions of Taub-NUT spacetime (see
[13,14,24,25]). Therefore, some physicists do consider liberalizations of the Hausdorff
condition. For example, Hawking [25, p. 174] allow for these non-Hausdorff manifolds that do not admit bifurcating geodesics. Similarly, Geroch [26, p. 465] allows for
non-Hausdorff manifolds in which every geodesic has a unique extension and every
curve has no more than one end point.
As a consequence, our initial question of whether non-Hausdorff manifolds are
physically reasonable splits into two: (1) are non-Hausdorff manifolds with bifurcating
geodesics physically reasonable (which is addressed in the objections (ii)-(v)) and
(2) are non-Hausdorff manifolds without bifurcating geodesics, which, according to
Theorem 4, violate strong causality, physically reasonable (which is addressed in the
objection (vi))?
Ad (ii)–(iii): The main problem that arises from the violation of the Hausdorff condition is indeterminism, both at the level of geodesics (i.e., curves followed by free
test particles) and at the level of the entire manifold (i.e., non-Hausdorffly attached
‘branches’). However, it is far from obvious that the fact that a theory involves indeterminism should be considered as an argument against it. For this argument to be
valid, the authors should provide some independent argument that indeterminism is
not allowed in physical theories (which seems to be too strong a position, as physicists
in general allow indeterministic theories) or that the specific form of indeterminism
that occurs in the case under consideration is unacceptable. Without such further support, this argument comes down to a simple rejection of indeterminism.
One way of supplementing this argument is to say that indeterminism is problematic
because it is a kind of arbitrariness and therefore should be avoided in science. The issue
of whether some arbitrariness exists in nature (and if so, what types of arbitrariness are
allowed) is interesting but somewhat speculative.10 It seems that in our explanation of
physical facts, we need to stop at some point anyway, which means that some arbitrary
factor needs to be postulated. It can be either the value of some physical constant or
the form of the equation; or, if we managed to derive both equations and constants,
the arbitrary factor would be the assumption from which they are derived. This is
10 The word ‘arbitrariness’ may seem to be ambiguous, as it can mean (1) that something is underdetermined, (2) that something lacks an explanation, or (3) that something is not objective. I assume that all
considerations of this paper concern issues that are objective, so I am not interested in the third sense.
Furthermore, I treat the first sense as a special case of the second: if the evolution of a physical system is
not deterministic, then there is no explanation why this particular trajectory or history has been realised
rather than some other that is also allowed by the laws.

arbitrariness at the level of general facts about our world (laws, constants, etc.). What
about the level of particular facts (i.e., why this particular course of events have been
realised from among the bigger set of courses of events allowed by what we called
‘general facts’)? Can we a priori exclude that something unexplainable is already at
the level of particular facts as indeterminism postulates? Do we have reasons to insist
that all the arbitrariness arises at the general level, that is, at the level of the structures
that explain particular facts, such as laws and physical constants? These are difficult
questions, but they have been intentionally posed in a way to suggest that there are
no obvious answers to them. And such answers, if attainable at all, should not be
found a priori, but on the basis of considering our best empirical theories; if some
of them are best interpreted as indeterministic, we are allowed to ascribe (tentatively)
indeterminism to the physical reality itself. The argument from indeterminism was
presented by Earman and Hájíček in a way suggesting that the answer is known a
priori or at least obvious on the basis of the empirical knowledge we already have,
but this is clearly not the case.
How should bifurcating geodesics or new branches attached to a manifold be conceptualized? An interesting interpretative option is that a basic object of GR does
not necessarily represent a single spacetime. In the case of non-Hausdorff manifolds,
another interpretation, which can be called ‘modal’, is available, namely that they
represent bundles of alternative possible spacetimes, only one of which is actual. This
interpretation can be supported by the following theorem (for the proof, see [15]):
Theorem 5 Any non-Hausdorff manifold can be constructed by gluing together a family of Hausdorff manifolds.
The modal interpretation, based on the above theorem, goes as follows. Any nonHausdorff manifold can be decomposed into a family of Hausdorff submanifolds11
(from which it can be obtained by gluing maps, see definition 6), and each of these
Hausdorff manifolds represents a single possible spacetime.12 A non-Hausdorff manifold represents all the possibilities, taken together, but exactly one of them actualises.
Things look similar at the level of geodesics. A bifurcation of geodesics requires nonHausdorffness to occur, which means that each branch of a geodesic can be associated
with a single spacetime, and bifurcating geodesics as a whole can be interpreted as
representing the possible trajectories of free test particles, exactly one of which actualises.13 This is why the notion of the basic object of GR instead of just spacetime
has been used throughout the text; according to the modal interpretation, a single
spacetime is not the only object that can be represented by a manifold.
One may worry that such an interpretation leads us too far away from the original
theory: if we include the subject matter of a theory in its identity conditions and
assume that the subject matter of GR is spacetime, then the above change of the
11 Such a decomposition is not unique; however, if we restrict to maximal Hausdorff submanifolds, it will
be unique.
12 A similar idea in the context of the theory of branching spacetimes has been developed by [27–30]: the
models of the branching spacetime axioms are non-Hausdorff, but histories (i.e., constructs representing
single spacetimes) are Hausdorff.
13 Therefore, we obtain here indeterminism in two senses: global for whole spacetimes and local for
geodesics; for more on this distinction, see [31,32].

123

subject matter would amount to changing the theory into a new one. To avoid the
mentioned assumption, I introduced in Sect. 2 the notion of the basic object of GR,
allowing in principle that it can be different from spacetime. In Sect. 4, a functional
restriction was placed on it, namely that it should play a certain role with respect to
matter; and in Sect. 5 it was stated that non-Hausdorff manifolds can play this role.
‘Can play’ means ‘have enough mathematical structure’ to do so; whether they actually
do can depend on the physical interpretation, but surely the modal interpretation does
not prevent them from doing so. Another way to convince ourselves that this is still the
same theory is to define its subject matter more ‘locally’, namely, instead of saying
that GR is about spacetime (or about a basic object of GR as defined earlier), one
can say that it describes spatiotemporal states of affairs (and every model of GR
describes many such states). Whether a given state of affairs is spatiotemporal does
not depend on whether it is actual, so merely possible spatiotemporal states of affairs
are still subjects of GR; and under the modal interpretation, non-Hausdorff manifolds
describe (actual and possible) spatiotemporal states of affairs no less than Hausdorff
manifolds, interpreted as single spacetimes, do.
Ad (iv): Earman’s quoted argument against extendible manifolds relies on reluctance to accept arbitrariness, which is the issue addressed while discussing objections
(ii)–(iii). However, two further points are to be made concerning this particular objection. First, some of the formal results suggest that in some cases, extendible manifolds
should be preferable over inextendible ones, as is summarized by Manchak [5, pp.
415–416], who says:
But, however compelling the metaphysics, it is sometimes problematic to insist
on inextendibility. For example, [16, p. 20] has shown that not every wellbehaved space-time admits a well-behaved inextendible extension. Should we
cling to inextendibility at the expense of other desirable space-time properties?
The answer is far from clear. Additionally, a space-time does not always have
just one inextendible extension [21, p. 9]. Thus, the principle of sufficient reason
can actually be used to argue against the property of inextendibility. After all,
why should one extension be preferred over another?
Therefore, even if we accept the type of reasoning based on the principle of sufficient
reason, it is not clear how it should work in the case of extendible manifolds. In
some cases, it is more important not to lose some other properties that our model of
spacetime is expected to have than to save inextendibility; and in some other cases,
more than one extension is available, and the choice between them is arbitrary, unless
one of them is distinguished by special properties the others lack.
The second point I want to make is specific to the context of the modal interpretation of non-Hausdorff manifolds. Adding new branches (at the level of mathematical
construction) to the already constructed manifold does not amount to enlarging the
model of the actual spacetime, as only one of these branches, at most, is actualised
under the modal interpretation. Therefore, what is extended is the structure of possible
alternatives for a spacetime to evolve, not the spacetime itself. To what extent does this
alleviate Earman’s worry? This worry can be formulated in two ways: one in terms
of the ‘Creative Force’ and the other in terms of the existence of sufficient reason,

123

638

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

but both formulations concern only the actualised part of the manifold; namely, they
state in different ways the question, ‘why has this particular spacetime been actualised
and not a larger one?’ Therefore, they ask about a single spacetime (the one that is
actualised), not about the whole bunch of spacetimes. And for the actualised part, there
is a good answer why it should not be extended to the whole non-Hausdorff structure:
because we identified a single spacetime with a Hausdorff submanifold.
Ad (v): Another objection posed by Earman, concerning energy, turns out to be
harmless if we carefully interpret branching structures as representing possible evolutions, where one branch at most can be actualised. In the actual world, the energy tensor
is wholly contained in one branch, and the discontinuity concerns only branches that
are not realised. Therefore, if the continuity condition is violated at all, it is not violated
by any actual physical object, only by non-actual ones. What about a counterfactual
situation in which a different branch had been actualised? Then energy would follow
that other branch which is actualised in that counterfactual situation. There would
never be a problem of discontinuity in the actual physical reality. As we do not need
to postulate that energy follows all the branches, the problem with the conservation of
energy does not arise.14
Ad (vi): As already mentioned in the exposition of this objection, it is not the
violation of strong causality that is problematic, but the violation of a weaker condition,
called the chronology condition; strong causality is perceived as a desired feature
because of its close relation with the chronology condition. According to the quote
by Hawking, we should disregard manifolds that are not strongly causal because they
are, is some sense, very close to manifolds that contain closed timelike loops.
Under which assumptions should this closeness be regarded as problematic? Hawking appeals to the idea of ‘nature judging accurately’, which seems to be a kind of
fine-tuning, and to quantum fluctuations. We have to deal with fine-tuning if, in a
space of possible models, the model that is supposed to be the actual one is very
close to other models that are radically different, where ‘closeness’ can be measured,
for example, in terms of values of some physical parameter with respect to which
the models differ. This situation is regarded as problematic because it makes some
important characteristics of the actual model improbable; to get the actual model, the
values of the appropriate parameters should be ‘fine-tuned’. This type of reasoning is
often invoked in the context of particle physics.15 In our context, it is not clear which
parameter would be fine-tuned, but it is clear that almost-closed timelike curves are,
in some sense, ‘close’ to closed timelike curves.
A typical objection to fine-tuning arguments is that they require an assumption
about a probability measure on the space of possible models, and there is no way to
infer such a measure from what is observed. Furthermore, if the choice of parameters
is a single, unrepeatable ‘event’, then the whole idea of describing it probabilistically
is suspicious. Perhaps the origin of a probability measure, in our context, should be
from quantum theory as the invoking of quantum fluctuations by Hawking suggests.
If we allowed for manifolds violating strong causality—the reasoning can go—then
14 Another possible way of argumentation is that in GR the notion of global energy conservation is problematic anyway.
15 For a review of the issue of fine-tuning in general, see [33]. It is investigated critically in the context of

particle physics, for example, by [34–36].

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

639

we would also allow for all the manifolds that are obtainable from them by quantum
fluctuations, and manifolds that violate chronology are probably among them. But this
‘probably’ is supported by intuition rather than calculation; one cannot exclude that
quantum laws prevent somehow quantum fluctuations from entering the chronologyviolating region (in the space of models) even if one starts from manifolds violating
strong causality.
This ananlysis is clearly inconclusive, but at least two messages can be drawn
from it. First, the violation of strong causality alone does not lead to the interpretative
problems connected with causal loops. Second, starting from the chronology condition,
we need some quite substantial additional assumptions to justify strong causality as a
physical reasonability condition.
Ad (vii): Penrose’s arguments do not concern non-Hausdorff manifolds as such, but
only one possible way of using them in physics. The first argument concerns the fact
that no detailed model connecting non-Hausdorff manifolds with the known forms
of indeterminism has been built, but the possibility of such a model is not excluded
by Penrose. It is also not obvious that the only motivation for using non-Hausdorff
manifolds can come from the Everettian interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as
Penrose seems to implicitly assume; other indeterministic interpretations of Quantum
Mechanics can provide an equally good motivation, and of course, one does not need
to restrict to Quantum Mechanics (although it is currently the most serious candidate
for a theory capturing genuinely indeterministic phenomena).
Regarding the second argument, solving the issue of the direction of time does not
need to be a role of non-Hausdorff manifolds. The question under investigation is
whether they may form a basis for physical models of the actual world (or at least of
some physically possible world), not what further problems can be solved by using
them. The idea that some relationship between indeterminism and the direction of time
exists is attractive because indeterminism is a temporally asymmetric phenomenon:
there is only one way for the past to be (namely, the actual one), but there is more than
one way for the future to be (as it is not unambiguously determined). However, it is
not yet clear whether the two asymmetries are indeed the same or even deeply related,
and more popular discussions of the direction of time do not refer to indeterminism
at all (see, e.g., [37, part II]). However, attempts have been made to try to relate the
asymmetry of past and future with the asymmetry involved in indeterminism (see,
e.g., [38,39]), so if they are accurate and if the correct representation of indeterminism
involves non-Hausdorff manifolds, Penrose’s claim may turn out to be false.
Penrose’s third objection can be decomposed into three steps: (1) the only motivation for using non-Hausdorff manifolds in physics is the Everettian interpretation
of quantum mechanics; (2) this interpretation commits us to paradoxical theses about
minds and their relationship to the world; from (1) and (2), it follows that (3) nonHausdorff manifolds have no place in physics. We have already seen that the first
premise is highly contestable. And the second premise is clearly false: the Everettian
interpretation should not be read as assuming anything about the nature of mind and
consciousness—it is not the same as the ‘many-minds’ interpretation. Instead, it should
be called the many-worlds interpretation or the emergent multiverse interpretation, as
in Wallace’s [40] book. Therefore, the argument is more about potential problems
for the many-minds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and does not threaten non-

123

640

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

Hausdorff manifolds as such, as using models based on non-Hausdorff manifolds
does not commit us in any way to any hypotheses about the relationship between the
physical world and our minds.

9 Two Senses of Modality
In considerations concerning the use of non-Hausdorff manifolds as basic objects
of GR, two senses of modality were engaged. The first one, connected with indeterminism, was the basis of the modal interpretation of non-Hausdorff manifolds as
representing a bundle of alternative possible spacetimes rather than a single spacetime.
The second one is connected with the different stages of determining the proper structure to describe the physical world: the object that passes more stages can be regarded
as ‘more possible’ or possible in a stronger sense, and the whole path culminates in
reaching the mathematical structure that represents the actual physical world.16
In the case of GR, and perhaps other theories, some of the dynamically possible
models have properties regarded as pathological, so they are excluded as physically
unreasonable. One can propose that this exclusion corresponds to the difference in
the level/strength of possibility: physically reasonable models are ‘more’ possible
than merely dynamically possible ones, which are ‘more’ possible than those that
are merely kinematically possible, but only one of them is the model of the actual
physical world. This proposal assumes that it makes sense to talk about the levels
or strengths of modality, which amounts to two claims: that there are many types of
modalities and that they can be graded linearly or partially according to some criteria.
Concerning the first claim, it has been defended recently by some metaphysicians (e.g.,
[41–43]). Concerning the second claim, at least partial grading is typically assumed
in theories that allow many types of modality; a more familiar example could be
the distinction between mathematical or logical and physical possibility, the first of
which is weaker (and the respective necessity is stronger). The picture of the types of
modalities associated with the first three stages of Sect. 3 would amount to adding a
similar grading within physical possibility and necessity itself.
Are these different levels of physical modality a genuine metaphysical feature of the
world or merely the reflection of the way we think about it and construct models? Perhaps it only captures the fact that some features of the world are more easily identifiable
than others, but in reality, they are all on a par. However, the other option is that there
is indeed some hierarchy of importance between them, which is mirrored by different
‘strengths’ of modality associated with different stages of constructing a theory.
To make the picture even more complicated, the hierarchy of the four stages suggested here can be contested. For example, Curiel [6] suggests that energy conditions
(not discussed in this paper), which belong to physical reasonability conditions, are in
some sense, more fundamental than other physical reasonability conditions and even
than the Einstein equations because they are applicable across a wide range of theories
of spacetime (not only in GR), and we do not know how to prove them starting from
16 ‘Actual’ with respect to the modality of the second type, so it can be itself a modal structure in the first,
indeterministic sense.

123

Foundations of Physics (2020) 50:621–643

641

some other conditions17 (while in contrast, many other physical reasonability conditions admit such proofs). Nevertheless, to formulate them mathematically, we need a
general framework, so we need to go at least through the kinematic stage. Additionally,
the typical use of such conditions is to narrow down the set of dynamically possible
models, so in the exposition of a physical theory, their place is after both the kinematic
and the dynamical stage.

10 Summary
From the above considerations, at least two conclusions emerge. First, non-Hausdorff
manifolds can be regarded as basic objects of GR, along with Hausdorff manifolds. If
they were to be excluded, this would be done at the level of the physical reasonability
stage – but even this is not clear, as argued in Sect. 8. I do not postulate that scientific
practices or the way in which textbooks are written should change, but the message of
this paper is that we should bear in mind the conceptual difference between violating
one of the defining conditions for a basic object of GR and violating one of the physical
reasonability conditions. This observation, however, opens the door for potentially
extending the scope of relativistic investigations so that they include non-Hausdorff
manifolds in addition to Hausdorff ones.
The second conclusion is that non-Hausdorff manifolds are better interpreted as
bundles of alternative possible spacetimes rather than as a single spacetime. The above
two conclusions are connected with the two senses of modality discussed in Sect. 9.
Determining the exact metaphysical and epistemological significance of these two
senses seems to be a topic worth investigating for philosophers of physics.

Abstract
Discussions on indeterminism in physics focus on the possibility of an open future,
i.e. the possibility of having potential alternative future events, the realisation of one
of which is not fully determined by the present state of affairs. Yet, can indeterminism affect also the past, making it open as well? We show that by upholding principles of finiteness of information one can entail such a possibility. We provide a toy
model that shows how the past could be fundamentally indeterminate, while also
explaining the intuitive (and observed) asymmetry between the past—which can be
remembered, at least partially—and the future—which is impossible to fully predict.

1 Introduction
One of the fundamental questions in the philosophy of physics aims to establish
whether the evolution of every physical system is governed by determinism—i.e.
if any two states of a system at different times are related by a one-to-one connection—or if future events can in principle have multiple potential outcomes that are
not fully determined by the past states. While for centuries it was believed that such

a deterministic account is uncontroversially true (mostly due to the empirical success of the equations of motion of classical physics and their mathematical properties),1 the advent of quantum physics raised a lasting debate that leans towards the
solution that the world is actually indeterministic. In recent years, we have proposed
that even classical physics should be interpreted indeterministically, if one assumes
the reasonable principle of finiteness of information density (i.e., finite volumes of
space can only contain a finite amount of information) [2–6].
Indeterminism certainly grants to the direction of time a fundamental role, for
changes really happen: while time passes, from an array of mutually exclusive
potential events, only one obtains. However, once one event has been actualized, it
is considered determinate and this status does not undergo further change as time
passes. While the future is open in an indeterministic world, the past is there to stay,
as encapsulated also by C. F. von Weizsäcker when stating that “the past is factual,
the future is possible” [7]. Nevertheless, some authors in the philosophical literature
(notably, Łukasiewicz [8] and Dummett [9, 10]) have hinted at the possibility that
upholding indeterminism could have consequences for the past too. Yet, this idea
that the past could also not be fully determined by the present state of affairs at a
fundamental level in an indeterministic world seems to have been often overlooked
even within the numerous debates about indeterminism.
It is the aim of this paper to revive the question: can the past be open?, hoping
that this will motivate further attempts of addressing this problem. It should immediately be noticed that while we are in general not able to predict the future with
certainty—which leaves room for a philosophical debate on whether to interpret this
as either a lack of knowledge about the underlying determinism or as fundamental indeterminism—we do seem to remember the past (that is, it exists information
about the past that can in principle be remembered with certainty). This, therefore,
begs the consequent question: if the past is open, why do we observe such an asymmetry in terms of predictions retrodictions? In what follows, building further on
principles of finiteness of information that entail indeterminism, we provide a toy
model that aims to show how the past as well could become (again) fundamentally
indeterminate while explaining the intuitive asymmetry between the past, which
seems determinate in our recollections, and the future, which is in general impossible to fully predict.

2  Can the Past be Open?
In the most general sense, without any ontological commitment, the laws of physics
can be regarded as causal relations that connect pure states of a system at different
instants of time (given a suitable conception of a time-arrow). Note that a pure state
is in this case generally defined as the state encapsulating the maximal amount of
information existing at present about each relevant degree of freedom of the system
itself. Note that, as in our previous works [2–6], we uphold a physical interpretation
1
Note that there are exceptional cases where the classical equations of motions do not have a unique (i.e.
deterministic) solution, such as in the case of Norton’s dome [1].

of information. This means that information becomes meaningful only when embodied in distinguishable states of a physical system. In the words of Landauer who pioneered this ideas, “Information is not a disembodied abstract entity; it is always tied
to a physical representation. It is represented by engraving on a stone tablet, a spin,
a charge, a hole in a punched card, a mark on paper, or some other equivalent. This
ties the handling of information to all the possibilities and restrictions of our real
physical word, its laws of physics and its storehouse of available parts.” [11].2
In the broadest possible sense, two events—named the cause (C) and the effect
(E), respectively—are said to be causally related in the case that if C obtains, it
influences the tendency for E to obtain. Note that for this to happen, C must happen before E. Following this general definition of causal laws, in the present note
we consider different examples of indeterministic physics, showing that indeterminism can entail not only the known indeterminacy about the future but about the past
as well, which truly evaporates as time passes. By this we do not mean merely an
epistemic statement, namely that it is our knowledge of the past which evaporates.
Rather, it is the available information that disappears from some degrees of freedom
of the universe that were encoding it, and therefore it ceases to exist altogether.
2.1  Deterministic Causality and Spontaneous “Acausal” Events
In “orthodox” classical physics, it is assumed that causally connected events are all
related by necessity (deterministic causality). The causal connections are in this way
fixed for all times, i.e., every event that obtains is the certain result of the previous
events that obtained before, without the possibility of alternative ones. This forms a
causal “chain” all given at once, ad infinitum towards both the past and the future.
However, possible alternatives have been already considered in the vast literature
devoted to (in)determinism. As a first example, consider the following possibility
to avoid a deterministic world: even if one maintains deterministic causality as the
norm, some authors had it that it is possible to conceive that the chain of necessary cause-effect relations is from time to time interrupted by an “acausal” event,
that spontaneously obtains independently of any other previous event. Note that this
is not the position that we endorse, for the concept of a genuinely “acausal” event
that suddenly arises out of nothing seems arbitrary and unsatisfactory. More formally, if the events that are one the cause of the other are represented as nodes in a
directed (because causes precede their effects), acyclic (because an event is never
the cause of itself) graph, spontaneous acausal events may create disconnected parts
in the graph. This possibility clearly leads to the openness of the future in so far as
some future events may not be inferred even given complete determinacy of all the
events that are causally connected to the present (and to the past), because a possible
future spontaneous event can create a new unpredictable, disconnected subgraph of
the whole causal graph. In a similar fashion, Łukasiewicz suggested that the same

2
This view departs from other popular views in the philosophy of information that regard information as
an epistemic or even an abstract concept (see [12, 13]).

13

4

conclusion should be reached about the past: if no causal connections still exist at
present with a certain past event (or more realistically a whole past, disconnected
subgraph), that event should not any more be considered determined. In his words,
“facts whose effects have disappeared altogether, and which even an omniscient
mind could not infer from those now occurring, belong to the realm of possibility
and not the realm of actuality. One cannot say about them that they took place, but
only that they were possible.” [8]. In what follows, we would not further consider
this somewhat unsatisfactory approach of “disconnected” deterministic chains, but
rather develop a framework of causally complete and yet fundamentally indeterministic physics.
2.2  Probabilistic Causality and Finite Information
Since the mid-twentieth century, philosophers of science such as of Popper [14],
Earman [15], Salmon [16], Dowe [17], Reichenbach [18], Good [19] and Suppes
[20] have generalized the concept of causality to indeterministic scenarios, developing the idea of probabilistic causality. This states that an event C affects the tendency of another event E to happen, but E is not bound to happen by necessity. This
generalizes the Leibnitzian principle of sufficient reason:“there is nothing without
a reason, or no effect without a cause”, but causation is here meant as a looser connection between events than determinism. The standard way to quantify a tendency
for an event to happen is to make use of probabilities. In this case, however, probabilities are thought of as propensities (as introduced by Popper [14]), i.e. objective
properties of a physical system, in relation to an idealized environment, to change
from a pure state to another (see also [21, 22]).3
In a probabilistic causal scenario, events can be graphically represented as
embedded in a directed and acyclic multigraph, with two types of edges (Fig. 1).
The first type of edges represents a “potential” causal connection and each of these
edges is weighted with the propensity that relates two events, i.e. associated with a
non-negative rational number such that the sum of the weights connecting a cause to
all possible, mutually exclusive events is equal to 1. The second type of edges represents instead an “actual” causal connection, picking only one among the mutually
exclusive “potential” causal connections (these edges can also be regarded as each
weighted with a constant propensity equal to 1, which corresponds to certainty). The
potential graph represents all the possible alternative histories and it seems prima
facie independent of the time that one is considering (always given that the information is finite). However, the values of the weights (i.e. the propensities) evolve

3
Note that in our view, which slightly departs from Popper’s original one, we refer to an idealized environment, because a real environment would come with its own noise that may contribute to the frequencies of outcomes but this is irrelevant to the system’s propensities. This can be understood by looking at
quantum theory where the propensities are fully characterized by the pure state and the idealized measurement operators.

in time.4 The graph of actual causal connections, instead, develops in time out of
the former and it is only when the propensities evolve in time taking the value 1
(thereby ruling out the potential alternative effects to which the corresponding propensities all take the value 0) that this can be constructed. Note that this implicitly
defines the concept of present, which is the time slice that separates the subgraph
containing exclusively events connected by propensities 0 or 1 (i.e. the past) from
the subgraph that contains arbitrary propensities (i.e. the future).
A clarification on the concept of “event” seems in order. In standard probability theory, an event is an element of a sample space, which together with a 𝜎-algebra and a measure function defines a probability space. Here, we do not necessarily
assume that propensities are probabilities at the formal level (i.e. that they fulfill all
the Kolmogorov axioms), although they intuitively play the same role in quantifying likelihood. Hence, when we refer to an event, we mean anything that the theory
can talk about, namely any proposition to which it is possible to attach a measure of

4

It should be stressed that, contrarily to the deterministic causality discussed above, in a potential causal
graph there are no disconnected subgraphs, so the argument of Łukasiewicz does not seem to be applicable.

13

likelihood.5 In particular, one can relate the current theoretical framework in terms
of events to our proposed indeterministic interpretation of classical physics based
on finite information quantities (FIQs) [3]. A FIQ is an array of propensities that
quantify the tendency of each digit of a physical variable (written in binary base) to
take the value 1, under the constraint that the total information content of the array
is finite. An event can in this context be thought of as the actualization of a digit of
a FIQ.
It should be clear at this point that a probabilistic view on causality entails indeterminism in the sense that empirical statements about the future are in general
undecidable (they are neither true nor false), not even in principle, despite having
complete knowledge of all the existing information of the present (pure) states. This
makes the law of the excluded middle fail, relating the problem of indeterminism
and undecidability of empirical statements to mathematical intuitionism (see [5, 23,
24]). In this way, propositions the likes of “it will rain in Paris in a year from now”,
or “the position of a certain particle will be on the left side of a plane at a future
time tf ” do not have (at present) a determinate truth value, not only because this
might be unknown, but because it is not (yet) determined.
M. Dummett pointed out that this kind of fundamental indeterminacy (which he
misleadingly called anti-realism at first [9]) is not only a feature of future events,
but it extends towards the past as well when no trace is left that would allow one to
decide the truth value of a proposition about the past: “only those statements about
the past are true whose assertion would be justified in the light of what is now the
case. [T]his means that there is no one past history of the world: every possible history compatible with what is now the case stands on an equal footing.” [9] (see also,
[10]).6 On this note, we would like to point out that Dummet’s misleading term “antirealism” was supposed to actually refer to indeterminism (about the future and in this
case about the past too). This confusion is quite widespread, as one of us pointed out:
“Sometimes realism is defined as the hypothesis that every physical quantity always
has a value. But then, either this value is unaccessible, hence unphysical, or this value
can be revealed by appropriate measurements (to arbitrary good approximation, at
least in principle). Hence, these measurements have predetermined outcomes and
realism is nothing but a fancy word for determinism” [26]. In fact, our proposal in
terms of objective propensities maintains realism while introducing irreducible indeterminism (see also [27] for a more precise definition of indeterministic realism).
Similar considerations to the ones hinted at by Dummet can be refined by making use of the concept of information and its relation to physics. Within probabilistic
causality, in fact, the state of a system can thus be regarded as the piece of information recording the whole multigraph G (see a simple illustration thereof in Fig. 1),
i.e. the ordered collection
5
For example, the proposition “it is raining” can be true without all involved air-particles having fully
determined positions and momenta. This indeterminacy implies that a proposition about future weather
is presently undetermined. When time passes, particles gain some determinacy (but not full determinacy)
and thus some propositions about the future become either true or false.
6
While supporting the view that statements are true only if there is an empirical justification or verification (a position that he named firstly anti-realism and later justificationsm [25]), Dummett considered the
openness of the past an undesirable consequence.

G(t) ∶ [E(t), Ω(t), P(t)],

(1)

where E(t) is the set of all events (nodes), Ω(t) is the set of all potential causal connections (edges), respectively, stored in some degrees of freedom in the universe,
while P(t) is the set of propensities (weights) all at the considered (present) time t.
Note that G(t) encompasses both kinds of edges, those corresponding to the “potential” causal influences of the future (weighted blue edges in Fig. 1), whose propensities are a rational number between 0 and 1, and all the “actual” causal influences
that pertain to the past, whose propensities are all either 0 or 1 (red edges in Fig. 1).
In a series of papers [2–6], we introduced the principle of finiteness of information density, according to which finite regions of space can only contain finite information, and showed that this entails the possibility of fundamental indeterminism
both in classical mechanics and in special relativity. Along the same lines, we also
impose in the present framework that the state G(t) must contain only finite information. The information content of the state G(t) can be evaluated by, for instance, the
Kolmogorov complexity of the string constructed by writing all the elements of the
sets that compose G(t), or any other reasonable measure of information. Let us call
the information content of the state I(G(t)) = I(E(t)) + I(Ω(t)) + I(P(t)). Imposing
that this has a finite value, in general rules out the possibility that the graph has an
infinite amount of nodes and edges in any finite time interval, and that any of its
elements is represented by a real number (this is why we defined propensities to be
rational numbers, but they could more generally be computable numbers which still
contain a finite amount of information). Moreover, one can separate the information content of the graph G(t), into a part relative to the past and one relative to the
future:

I(G(t)) = I(G(t))past + I(G(t))fut ,

(2)

where I(G(t))past = I(E(t))past + I(Ω(t))past + I(P(t))past and I(G(t))fut = I(E(t))fut
+I(Ω(t))fut + I(P(t))fut . While there is no reason that the amount of events as well
as of potential causal connections in the past is higher than that in the future or vice
versa, there is a clear asymmetry in the information contents I(P(t))past and I(P(t))fut .
Indeed, while P(t)past is a string containing only 0s and 1s, P(t)fut is a string that
can contain any arbitrarily long rational numbers. Therefore, I(P(t))past < I(P(t))fut ,
which entails

I(G(t))past < I(G(t))fut ,

(3)

where we have assumed that the amount of events and potential causal connections
in the past and in the future is roughly the same. So, describing the future requires
storing more information, because this contains all the non-trivial propensities associated with the “potential” alternative events (most of which will never obtain). On
the other hand, a record of the past history, i.e. of all and only the events that have
happened with certainty (i.e. with an updated propensity of 1), clearly requires less
information.
Let us now assume that:

13

Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the different time slices.
Both the remote past and the
remote future are characterized
by totally random propensities,
i.e. each of n mutually exclusive
events has an associated propensity of 1/n (for the past, we
call these “random connections”
rather than propensities because
they do not undergo further
evolution). The colored box
represents the (non-trivial) state
of the universe: the determined
past (characterized by actualized
events, i.e. with propensities of
either 0 or 1) and the foreseeable future (where the propensities are between 0 and 1, but
in general not totally random)
(Color figure online)

(i) The universe is finite, i.e., it has finite resources occupying a finite volume of
space. This, together with the principle of finiteness of information density
recalled above, means that the total amount of information in the universe is
also finite. Suppose that this total amount of information storable in the universe is upper bounded by N bits.
(ii) By homogeneity of time, this maximal amount of storable information in
the universe is roughly symmetrically centered around the present instant (as
defined above). Namely, about N/2 bits are used to record information about
the past, i.e. I(G(t))past , and roughly the other N/2 are recording I(G(t))fut.
Since the amount of information is bounded, while time passes the finiteness of
the information requires some past information to be erased. This would mean that
the past as well could become open again as the amount of information of which
event caused the earliest in time recorded event forces it to be erased. Having lost
information about the propensities of the past event, it remains only to assign equal
weight to the alternative “potential” past events (which we may call “random past
causal connections” rather than propensities because they do not evolve anymore
and never actualize, see Fig. 2). This leads to the concept of open past, that is, not all
the propositions formulated at present about past times are determinate; for instance,
the question “was the event E at time tj caused by the event C at time ti < tj ?” is in
general neither true nor false for times ti sufficiently far away in the past (i.e. for

13

Foundations of Physics (2023) 53:4

Page 9 of 11 4

some ti << t0, where t0 is the present time). Note, however, that this construction
maintains the desirable asymmetry between past and future in a fundamentally indeterministic theory.7 Both the past and the future are thus indeterminate, and yet we
can know more about the past and less about the future as our intuition and experience suggest. Note that this is in agreement with what also Dummet had in mind
(and, although with another basic construction, Łukasiewicz too), namely that the
set of past events remain fixed and once time passes the propensities associated with
a collection of n mutually exclusive events become homogeneous, i.e. 1/n.8 Since
which one of the possible events has happened is now totally random, the information content is zero and this remote past can be considered fundamentally erased, in
the same sense that the remote future (i.e. those events that have a totally random
propensity associated with them) is fully indeterminate.9 Worth noticing is the position of certain authors, notably Albert [29], who have criticized the possibility of
basing the distinction between past and future on records. This relies on the argument that independently of how much redundancy of information allegedly about
the past (i.e. records) one can observe at present, it is always possible to account
for it by statistical fluctuations. Albert proposes instead the concept of intervention,
that is, the belief that the future counterfactually depends on present choices while
the past does not (this is so because Albert considers an underlying deterministic
description, therefore one can only imagine possible different worlds where a choice
could have differed from the actual one). Our model, on the other hand, presupposes
the existence of genuinely indeterministic (yet causally related) events and this naturally provides a direction of time. The information about the past—the records in
Albert’s jargon—has the same nature of the information about the future, namely
both encode the propensities that relate causes and effects. The asymmetry does not
arise from different statuses granted to past and future but rather from the amount of
information required to encode the causal connection about the past and about the
future, respectively.
Finally, the fact that the information recorded in the universe about the causal
connection goes farther away in the past than in the future is not the only asymmetry between the past and the future in an indeterministic world. In fact, while
future events eventually become determinate (the associated propensities for an
event to happen will either become 0 or 1, so every statement will become decidable for a certain time), the information erased from the past is forever lost, and
past statements will forever remain undecidable (which here means fundamentally
indeterminate). This wass already hinted at by J. Butterfield: “Dummett’s idea tends
to condemn the past to a more endemic unreality [i.e. fundamental indeterminacy
(see discussion above)] than the future. For, on the one hand, singular observational statements about the future seem effectively decidable –we naturally envisage
7
This thus departs from the proposal to Ref. [28], in which it is argued that the openness of the past
results from both indeterministic and time-symmetric nature of the laws of physics.
8
The transition from a determinate past to a fully random connection can happen as a sudden jump or
have a smother transition that passes through intermediate biased random connections. We leave this distinction as an open question in our model.
9
A possible alternative would be to consider a dynamical set of events, such that an event that has a
totally random propensity associated is not considered as “existing”.

making an expedition to the place and time in question, with instruments, if need be,
in hand. On the other hand, for analogous statements about the past, there is no such
procedure” [30]. In this sense, the openness of the past becomes wider and wider as
time passes.
To conclude, we would like to clarify that the toy model here presented has no
claim of being any close to the real mechanism (if any exists) that erases the past
as time passes. It is intended as the simplest conceptual way to formalize the idea
that the past can be (again) open in an indeterministic world, while maintaining the
desired asymmetry between past and future. We hope in this way to stimulate further debate on the topic of indeterminism and its implications on our way of understanding past, present and future in indeterministic theory, possibly within quantum
mechanics as well.

Freedom in the Many‑Worlds Interpretation

Abstract
I analyze the possibility of free-will in the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), arguing for their compatibility. I use as a starting point Nicolas Gisin’s “The Multiverse
Pandemic” (preprint arXiv:​2210.​05377, 2022, after Gisin, N., “L’épidémie du multivers”, in “Le Plus Grand des Hasards”, Belin, Paris, 2010), in which he makes an
interesting case that MWI is contradicted by our hard to deny free-will. The counts
he raised are: (1) MWI is deterministic, forcing choices on us, (2) in MWI all our
possible choices happen, and (3) MWI limits creativity, because everything is entangled with everything else. I argue that each of these features of MWI is in fact compatible with more freedom than it may seem. In particular, MWI allows compatibilist free-will, but also free-will very much like the libertarian free-will defined by
Chisholm. I argue that the position that alternative choices exist as possibilities does
not make sense from a physical point of view, but MWI offers a physical ground for
alternatives.

1 Introduction
This article focuses on free-will only in relation with physics, especially with quantum mechanics, in particular the many-worlds interpretation [1, 2]. I will ignore the
aspects of free-will related to legal and moral responsibility, but also numerous other
related themes, including philosophy and religion and their rich histories. There are
many others who analyzed and discussed all these much better than I could ever do,
here is a selection [3–11].

I will use as a starting point for this discussion of free-will in the context of the
many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics Nicolas Gisin’s criticism [1,
2], since it touches on important questions and it is well-written.
Perhaps the most important division of the views on free-will is based on the
existence of indeterminism and its role.
Libertarian free-will requires indeterminism, so that the free agent is able to
make choices free from both external and internal constraints, including even the
agent’s own motives and tendencies [8]. It is important that indeterminism is used
in the process of decision-making, but not in a “passive” way, because indeterminism by itself doesn’t guarantee free-will any more than basing your choices
on tossing a coin or on using Vaidman’s Quantum World Splitter [12] does. The
agent should be the source of his choices or actions, it should initiate them, unaffected by prior events, and so that it could have made a different choice. According to Chisholm [13]:
If we are responsible, and if what I have been trying to say is true, then
we have a prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us,
when we act, is a prime mover unmoved. In doing what we do, we cause
certain events to happen, and nothing–or no one–causes us to cause those
events to happen.
Here is an illustration of libertarian free-will, based on the graphical user interfaces used on computers. Alice is an agent that makes a choice between two
options, having a coffee, or having a tea. She can choose to have a coffee,
(1)
or she can choose to have a tea
(2)
By contrast, according to compatibilism, not only free-will is compatible
with determinism, but determinism is necessary for freedom, because it allows
the agent to decide and act based on its own past history, desires, motives, and
tendencies. For compatibilist free-will, we need at least “effective determinism”, by which I mean that even if at the micro-physical scale determinism is
not true, the decision-making is shielded from indeterminism so that it is, for all
practical purposes, a deterministic process. The agent is the source of her own
actions, without needing to choose among alternatives. For example, if you want
to drive a car, play piano, type some text, indeterminism, or even deterministic
but chaotic causes, may affect your ability to control yourself and to exercise
your freedom. This doesn’t necessarily require that determinism is valid down
to the scale of micro-physics, but at least that it is effectively valid in the agent’s
decision-making.
Compatibilist free-will would determine Alice to have coffee, excluding tea,

(3)
or to have a tea, excluding coffee
(4)
(I used the convention that the options excluded by determinism are “disabled”.)
Hard incompatibilism is the position that neither libertarian nor compatibilist
types of free-will are possible [14].
Hard incompatibilism seems to be the most logical conclusion of physicalism.
Physicalism claims that consciousness is reducible to the insentient substance that
we commonly call matter, and everything supervenes on the micro-physics. In the
philosophical and psychological discussions of free-will, the ability to make decisions cannot be separated from the agent’s consciousness. But when looking at the
micro-physical level, all we see is particles and fields blindly following the physical
law. Intention, decision, consciousness, all of these are supposed to emerge from
this. Then, there should exist an evolutionary explanation of why we developed the
sense of free-will: likely because in order to survive, we needed to care about ourselves [5]. To care about ourselves, it helps if we behave as if we take ownership of
our behavior, if we adopt as our own whatever changes occur in our physical states
due to the laws of physics. So the implication of physicalism is most likely that freewill is a useful illusion, whether we’re talking about deterministic or indeterministic
behavior. I’d like to add that many physicalists support some versions of free-will,
if defined in a way that avoids talking about anything else but the dynamics of the
physical stuff, interpreted as due to conscious agency only in a weakly emergent
sense [5, 15, 16], or where the illusion of freedom may be due to our inability to predict the result of our internal deliberation, as explained for example in [17].
If quantum mechanics ensures the existence of genuine indeterminism in nature,
how could it be used for free-will? Is the agent supposed to use a deterministic mechanism to decide what choice to make, and then to use the causal opening
offered by wavefunction collapse to enforce her decision, determined by the microphysics, to the physical world? From a physicalist point of view, this seems to make
little sense, because the decision itself would be deterministic. And if indeterminism
is involved in the decision-making, how is it different from just going along with
whatever the result of the wavefunction collapse is, in the exact same way compatibilists go along with the deterministic processes?
Whatever proposals to account for genuine free-will we may make, it seems
to me that they cannot be purely physicalistic, that we have to make additional
hypotheses that somehow are consistent with the physical laws, but without actually being reducible to them. Since these hypotheses can’t be read directly from
the micro-physics without requiring an interpretation, a narrative, they should be
seen as metaphysical assumptions. Any experimental test that can be reproduced
by third parties will report on the behavior of the matter following the physical
laws, and only with additional insights can it be interpreted as decision-making
of conscious agents. These additional insights have no origin in the uninterpreted

68 Page 4 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

reading of the micro-physical events, they come from our internal experiences
[3, 10]. Without having these experiences of freedom of choice, illusory or not,
it would probably never have occurred to us that there is such a thing as free-will,
just by examining the structure and dynamics of matter. Moreover, perhaps only
because we have these experiences ourselves, we attribute the existence of similar
experiences to other agents that we study, because we see them as not being fundamentally different from ourselves. So we know from our experiences that we
feel that we are agents able to make choices, we interpret these experiences based
on metaphysical assumptions, and we overlap these interpretations on the physical laws. But if we try to be authentic physicalists or materialists, if we go all the
way down, all remains is blindly interacting particles and fields, so we are forced
to deny our own experience and say that free-will, along with consciousness, are
some emergent behaviors, even illusions [18–20]. And indeed, even if we feel
that we used our free-will to make a choice, and that we could have done otherwise, in many instances neuroscience tells us that this was not the case [5, 11], so
at least we know that at least libertarian free-will is often, though not necessarily
always, an illusion. Physics, and natural sciences in general, say very little about
free-will and consciousness per se, they offer a rigid frame in which we project
our metaphysical intuitions and preferences.
More precisely, how are we supposed to determine by experiment, even if we
would be able to conduct it at the lowest scales and we collect all details about
the micro-physics, if a certain indeterministic event happened by itself, for example due to the wavefunction collapse, or it was caused by the agent as a prime
mover as Chisholm proposed? In fact, Chisholm acknowledges this problem [13]:
What, for example, is the difference between A’s just happening, and the
agents’ causing A to happen? We cannot attribute the difference to any
event that took place within the agent.
His solution is simply an appeal to tu quoque:
It is a problem that must be faced by anyone who makes use of the concept
of causation at all; and therefore, I would say, it is a problem for everyone
but the complete indeterminist.
That is, both the libertarian who thinks that the agent really has agency and the
compatibilist types of free-will suffer of the same problem: the micro-physics of
the agents works well without having to assume that the agents contribute with
anything more than just being subsystems in the world. Occam’s razor invites
the physicalist asked about free-will to reply in the same way Laplace replied to
Napoleon when he asked him about God: “Sire, I had no need of that hypothesis.”
The only difference is that, physicalists or not, we seem to experience free-will,
and we can take it as real, as an emergent phenomenon, or as a mere illusion,
albeit a useful one, both for motivating individual actions and for building societies in which we can rely on each other [21].
So while any discussion about free-will can use the physical laws as a “skeleton”, the “flesh” that can be added on that skeleton consists of metaphysical

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

Page 5 of 19 68

assumptions. To my knowledge, despite the fact that so many thinkers tried to
solve these issues, 60 years later the situation remains unchanged. And this situation is not improved by the fact that we still don’t know if quantum micro-physics
really is indeterministic [22, 23] or deterministic [24, 25], or effectively indeterministic per branch but deterministic for the whole wavefunction [26]. We also
don’t know if our decisions use, at least some times, noise or even genuine quantum indeterminism as a resource [22, 27–29].
An observation that I think is important is that many discussions about freewill assume from the start that the universe is not aligned with the will of the
agent, as if the agent is not an inherent part of the universe. This divisive attitude may betray an explicit or hidden belief in dualism. But what’s important is
that it informs the attitude we have with respect to free-will. And, since either
the universe is causally closed, or, if it’s not, and the only input in the causal
structure can only be indeterministic, this attitude of antagonism informs the
rejection of free-will by invoking physicalism. On the other hand, why should
we see ourselves as in such a big tension with the universe? Aren’t we parts of it?
Aren’t we here, evolved beings who wonder about the mysteries that we’ve understood so far and those yet unanswered, precisely because the universe brought us
into being? In this sense, there should be no conflict between physical laws and
freedom, anymore than the skeleton of our bodies bring some rigidity, but without this rigidity we wouldn’t be able to walk or to protect our decision-making
machines called brains.
For these reasons, while I am extremely interested in free-will, I have to admit
that I don’t know if we can use physics to prove any position on free-will. And since
everything else that can be added to transform the cold equations into a narrative
about agents experiencing or not freedom is added on top of what physics says,
when speaking from the point of view of physics I feel the need to say that I don’t
know what free-will is or even whether it exists. I can’t give a mathematical definition or a mathematical model of free-will, without having to appeal to an interpretation. Many tried to model free-will and even consciousness, but what I mean here is
that I don’t know a model that defines or models free-will by itself, without requiring an interpretation in terms of experiences. Let alone a model that is also physically realizable and empirically testable. But since I can’t say for sure that this is a
limitation of mathematics and physics, I must assume it’s my own, and therefore I
feel forced to take an epistemically modest position and simply say “I don’t know”.
And yet, even after admitting that we can’t read from the structures of mathematical physics whether they realize or not free-will, nor whether and how we can test
them empirically, we can try to see what interpretations or definitions of free-will
are logically compatible with these structures. And since we know that micro-physics is quantum, this can be a starting point of exploring these compatibilities.
Ever since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the postulation of the wavefunction collapse was associated with the most basic form of libertarian free-will, which
equates indeterminism with free-will [30–33]. More and more refined views about
libertarian free-will developed over time, for example Chisholm’s account of libertarian free-will in terms of the agent being a “prime mover unmoved”, which seems
to be echoed by Wheeler when discussing quantum measurements [34]:

68 Page 6 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

To use other language, we are dealing with an elementary act of creation.
If this provides an acceptable basis for free-will for those who think that the unpredictability of the results of quantum measurements leave room for free-will, others
don’t find such interpretations of quantum mechanics compelling for other reasons.
A notable example is Wheeler’s student Everett, who proposed that all results of
quantum measurements exist. After all, if the Schrödinger equation is a universal
law, why would this law be suspended and replaced with the wavefunction collapse
when we do a quantum measurement, as if the measuring device isn’t a quantum
system itself? Anyway, I don’t intend to address the usual questions about Everett’s
proposal, the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), in its original form or in different
variations (my modest answers to these questions can be found in [35, 36]). The
scope of this article is limited to the possible relations between MWI and free-will.
I will use as a main pretext Nicolas Gisin’s criticism of free-will in MWI, because it
manages to concentrate more lines of attack, some of them novel and profound, in a
concise form.

2  The Many‑Worlds Interpretation and Free‑Will
As I argued above, some of the perceived tensions between free-will and the physical laws come from seeing individual freedom as “me against the universe”. In the
many-worlds interpretation, this can reach a whole new level, “me against the multiverse”. In a recent very entertaining one-page article [1, 2], Nicolas Gisin raises
profound questions about free-will in MWI. He charges MWI on three counts, one
for each of the following features it has [26, 37–39]:
Feature 1 (Determinism) Since its dynamics is given by the Schrödinger equation
only, MWI is deterministic.
Feature 2 (Multiple alternatives) Everything that has a nonzero amplitude to happen, happens in some world.
Feature 3 (High-level of entanglement) Everything seems to be entangled with everything else, limiting creativity.
Because of the difficulties to define or to describe them in terms of physical data,
mentioned in the Introduction, I don’t really know how to define free-will or creativity physically, all I know is my own subjective experience of freedom. This experience may be in fact a compatibilist free-will experienced as libertarian free-will,
or it may be an illusion altogether. But in a world made of apparently insentient
physical stuff endowed with no intrinsic intentionality, this is our only source of
information that there is free-will. But we don’t need this, because if whatever we
call free-will corresponds to our experience, its compatibility with MWI should boil
down to whether MWI supports human beings having the experience of free-will

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

Page 7 of 19 68

just like in the interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) considered compatible
with free-will.
2.1  Determinism in MWI and Free‑Will
Count 1 In a deterministic world, we have no freedom.
Reply According to compatibilism, it is perfectly possible that our will is compatible with a causally closed world. But this may seem to be a too simplistic semantic
trick to avoid the problem, and there is more to be said.
But how can indeterminism allow free-will? How would it help if our decisions
are not fully determined by our own present state, but by occasional indeterminism
breaking into the causal chain?
Wouldn’t we be more free if we can determine our next decisions based on how
we are now, rather than letting them at the mercy of indeterminism?
Gisin mentions Descartes’ solution, that “mind” is ontologically distinct from
“matter”, and our will affects the physical by some “openings” in its causal chain.
But then, if dualism [40] is true and accounts for libertarian free-will, the stuff
making our mind, our will, should have its own logically consistent laws. And since
decision presupposes change, these laws should be those of a dynamical system,
deterministic or not. The “will-stuff” or the “mind-stuff” (res cogitans) should have
its own structure and its own dynamics, even if its nature is mental, similar to how
the “matter-stuff” or the physical-stuff (res extensa) has its own laws and dynamics.
Then, if the “will-stuff” interacts with the physical-stuff, they form together a larger
dynamical system [41], governed by some laws just like physical systems are. The
difference is just that it has a double ontology, “matter” and “mind”, but this is irrelevant for how it follows the laws. So we gained nothing, the “openings” in the causal
chain are just gates to a larger causal chain, and the questions return.
Another possibility to avoid the problem that indeterminism by itself does not
guarantee libertarian free-will is by making an assumption which leads to no physically detectable difference, a metaphysical one, like the one proposed by Chisholm,
in terms of the agent being a “prime mover unmoved”. Suppose that the agent acts
like a prime mover unmoved by using the wavefunction collapse, turning it, as
Wheeler put it, into “an elementary act of creation” [34].
But let us recall the full context of Wheeler’s quote:
To use other language, we are dealing with an elementary act of creation. It
reaches into the present from billions of years in the past. It is wrong to think
of the past as “already existing” in all detail. The “past” is theory. The past has
no existence except as it is recorded in the present. By deciding what questions
our quantum registering equipment shall put in the present we have an undeniable choice in what we have the right to say about the past.
We see that Wheeler’s participatory universe is more than simply using indeterminism as a backdoor in the causal chain of events. In addition to the wavefunction collapse, there is another opening in the causal chain: the initial conditions. What if

68 Page 8 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

the initial conditions are not fully specified at the beginning of time, but are gradually determined as more observations and choices are made? As if God left some
blank parameters defining the initial conditions of the deterministic universe, to be
filled in later by our own choices. Independently, Hoefer makes the case for this
“inside-out freedom” in classical special relativity, in [42].
But if we accept Wheeler’s idea of agents that participate to the initial conditions, we can apply it much strongly, to avoid the violations of unitary evolution
apparently required by the wavefunction collapse, but also the branching into more
worlds. This should be possible too, if our choices now can contribute to the initial conditions at the beginning of the universe, as I explained in [25, 43, 44] (also
see Scott Aaronson’s articles building on this idea [17]). If there are yet unspecified
values for some degrees of freedom, left blank, they can be adjusted later to lead
to a unique outcome for each measurement without having to collapse or branch
the wavefunction. These blank parameters may be filled in later, when choosing the
measurement settings, so that quantum measurements have definite results without
changing the Schrödinger equation, without collapse, without adding new variables,
and without creating new worlds.
This can be understood as “superdeterminism”, if we take the view that the initial conditions are already given at the beginning, but in such a way as to ensure
the uniqueness of the outcomes of measurements without appealing to collapse or
branching. Or it can be understood as “retrocausality”, if we adopt a four-dimensional block universe view as in relativity, but allow the state of the universe to be
specified by constraints distributed at various places and moments in time, that is,
not all of them being specified at the Big Bang [25].
I think the best way to think of them is in terms of sheaves of local solutions that
can be extended to global solutions [25, 45]. And, as a bonus, it allows free-will
as prime mover unmoved, so a libertarian kind of free-will, but in a deterministic
world whose initial conditions are not yet determined [43]. This is consistent with
Wheeler’s interpretation of the delayed choice experiment as making the case for
a participatory universe, but in a different way, in which unitary evolution is saved
(without resorting to many worlds) [46].
More recently, Gisin himself used this “causal opening” in the initial conditions
of the deterministic laws [47]. His argument is that, since exact real numbers contain
infinite information, they can’t describe the universe. He uses the idea of filling in
the blanks in the imprecision of numbers, as a way by which potentialities become
actualities in a deterministic world. He applies this idea to introduce indeterminism in Bohmian mechanics [24, 48]. By the way, Bohmian mechanics shares with
MWI the Features 1 and 3, and some may say Feature 2 as well,1 [49], so Gisin’s
arguments, if correct, should apply to Bohmian mechanics too. Conversely, the
1

Even if Bohmian mechanics proposes that the world as we experience it supervenes on the configurations of point-particles, there is nothing to stop similar worlds to supervene on the wavefunction, which
has branches just like MWI. These worlds must contain wavefunction patterns (in the sense of MWI, see
[38]) arranged and evolving like agents as well. This is necessary because these waves guide the pointparticles in their motion. And, when these “agent-like patterns” perform experiments, they are affected
by Feature 2, resulting in multiple outcomes in the wavefunction’s patterns just like in MWI.

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

Page 9 of 19 68

arguments proposed here can be applied to the guiding wavefunction in Bohmian
mechanics too.
However, what I propose here is an application to MWI of the idea that I originally used for a single-world unitary-only evolution. In MWI, there are also initial
conditions, and if they can be chosen to ensure a unique outcome, as in [50], this
should be possible also in MWI, for those cases when the agent uses quantum measurements within her own brain to make decisions. Therefore, in MWI the agents can
use the same loophole of “delayed initial conditions” to reduce their future choices,
even to a single choice. Similarly, even Gisin’s own proposal for infusing free-will in
a deterministic classical world or in Bohmian mechanics can work for MWI as well.
The proposal presented here has the advantages of both libertarian and compatibilist free-will, because the agent is free to act as a prime mover unmoved, but she
can do this in a way that also defines “retroactively” part of her own past, by filling
it the values of the degrees of freedom that remained blank and were not revealed
by observations up to the moment when she exercises her free-will. The agent can
make a free choice now, in the libertarian sense, and realize that this was what she
wanted all along but didn’t know it until now. 	
◻

2.2  Multiple Alternatives in MWI and Free‑Will
Count 2 If every possibility is realized, all our choices are realized, and we have no
freedom.
Reply If it seems limiting to be forced by micro-physics to make a particular choice,
it should probably feel more limiting to be forced to make all possible choices, even
those you don’t want to make.
But MWI does not force the agent to make all possible choices she may have.
MWI ensures branching when the wavefunction spreads over multiple macro-states
(which appear to us as classical [38]), for example when measurements happen, or
when atom or particle decays take place. If the agents can harness quantum measurements or decay within their brains in their decision-making, this still doesn’t mean
that they would make choices in contradiction with their own preferences or desires.
The argument from my reply to Count 1 applies to laws which, given the initial
conditions, determine a single history, while in MWI multiple histories happen. But
also in MWI not all choices happen. The only possible worlds are those consistent
with the initial state and unitary evolution, in the sense that these worlds are represented by state vectors that are not orthogonal to the unitarily evolved initial state.
This implies that choices that would result in a total state vector that could not have
evolved from the initial state are not available to the agent.
But how restricted is the allowed initial state of the universe? MWI requires
special initial conditions, otherwise branching into worlds would not happen only
towards the future, and the Born rule would not be consistent with the records of
past measurements kept in the present state of the world. But shouldn’t branching
be, by definition, only “towards the future”? What would even mean “branching

68 Page 10 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

towards the past”? It simply means that separated worlds, or even “parallel” worlds
that didn’t arrive from branching, can interfere. Suppose that after a spin 1/2 measurement along an axis we found that the spin is “up”. According to MWI, if the spin
prior to the measurement was a linear combination of “up” and “down”, there is also
a branch in which we found the spin to be “down”. A repetition of the measurement
in the first branch should find again that the spin is “up”. But if the two branches
interfere in the meantime, this will affect the result, and we can obtain that the spin
is “down”. Obtaining the spin “up” and then, by measuring it again, obtaining that
it is “down”, would be a violation of the Born rule. We normally exclude the possibility that the branches, once separated, can interfere again, by invoking decoherence. But the mechanism of decoherence works only if the initial conditions of the
universe are special, in a similar sense in which they have to be special to ensure that
the entropy increases. In MWI (and Bohmian mechanics for that matter), for branching to happen only towards the future, the initial conditions have to satisfy more or
less the same constraints as those necessary to ensure Second Law of Thermodynamics, as argued by Wallace (see Chapter 9 in [38]).
Note 1 In fact, the initial conditions turn out to be much stricter than simply being of
very low-entropy, as it is often believed. This was shown in [51]. Let me detail this
a bit, since it is a counterintuitive and unexpected result, and it may improve, even
if only marginally, the argument. The state space contains all possible state vectors.
This means, it contains state vectors that encode the records of results of measurements as they happened, but it also contains state vectors that encode records of
things that didn’t happen. For example, a state vector can contain an agent whose
brain contains false memories of herself levitating or turning into a unicorn, but it
is not plausible that what’s in her memory really happened. Similarly, a state vector
that contains false records of repeated spin measurements along the same axis, but
so that the subsequent measurements didn’t confirm the first result, can exist, but
such a history should be vanishingly rare. And yet, state vectors encoding an agent
with such false memories or containing records in clear violation of the Born rule
are perfectly valid state vectors in the quantum state space. The records can “lie”
about the past. In this case, there is no past history consistent with these records, the
states containing them are the result of interference, just like classical Boltzmann
brains (spontaneous “coagulations” of brains with false memories of their past history) are expected to result from fluctuations [52]. In [51] it was shown that such
situations are rather the rule than the exception: in the state space, the state vectors
containing agents with false memories akin to Boltzmann brains vastly outnumber
those containing only agents with reliable memories. The state vectors containing
records that are inconsistent with the actual past history of the system fill the state
space, and only a subspace of infinitely smaller dimension that that of the total space
contains reliable records. A quick solution to this puzzle may seem to assume that
the universe started in a very special low-entropy state. While this is condition is
necessary, it was shown in [51] that it is not sufficient, and a condition much stricter
than we expect is needed. The initial conditions have to be very restricted in a way
that takes into account the dynamical law and future records of the events. And it
was shown that these conditions should involve strong correlations between any

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

Page 11 of 19 68

particle and the rest of the universe, even if only to ensure the possibility to build a
well-calibrated measuring device ([51], Sect. 3). And this applies to all major interpretations of quantum mechanics. Normally, when imagining quantum experiments,
we take for granted the existence of measuring devices, but their very existence
requires very special initial conditions. In any interpretation of quantum mechanics,
the initial conditions have to depend of the of the laws and perhaps even of future
measurement set-ups. This was thought to be exclusively the problem of “superdeterministic” theories, but such correlations are required even by those interpretations
of QM that don’t rely on violations of Statistical Independence in Bell’s sense [53].

◻
The branching asymmetry discussed by Wallace in Chapter 9 of [38] and the argument from Note 1 give additional reasons why the kind of injection of freedom in
the initial conditions by filing the blanks later, when our choices take place, may
work for MWI too, allowing our will to limit the alternatives. If the compatibilization of libertarian free-will with the causal chain by filling in the blanks works for a
deterministic world, it should work for MWI too.
But, assuming that in MWI the agents’ decision-making can itself be subject to
branching, why being restricted to a unique choice would mean more freedom than
making all possible choices in different worlds? A world in which we can choose
only one thing and all the others are forbidden restricts our freedom. MWI allows us
to follow Yogi Bera’s advice,
When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
If Alice has to choose between two mutually exclusive options “coffee” and “tea”,
and wants them both, MWI allows her to choose both of them, albeit in different
worlds. In the world where Alice’s choice is coffee, she experiences doing this by
her own free-will, and similarly in the world where her choice is tea. Any attempt to
trace in her brain previous indications that she didn’t want to make that choice will
find none, because her state can’t evolve, even with collapse or branching, in a state
that contradicts her past history. The wavefunction has two branches,
(5)
where a, b are complex numbers so that a2 + b2 = 1. If MWI gives Alice the freedom to make both choices, it gives her more freedom.
For example, if Alice has to choose between mutually exclusive coffee and tea,
she can have it both ways in different worlds,
(6)
In (6) I used check boxes, which are not mutually exclusive, while the radio buttons
used in (1) and (2) are mutually exclusive.
And if Alice wants coffee but not tea, this means that her own disposition when
making the choice was to choose coffee, so that b = 0,

68 Page 12 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

(7)
Similarly, if she wants tea but not coffee, her disposition corresponds to a = 0,
(8)
Alice’s preference for coffee can be understood in the compatibilist sense, as being
determined by the initial conditions of the universe, but also in the libertarian sense,
as Alice choosing now how to fill in the blanks in these initial conditions. Therefore,
Alice can exercise her status of unmoved prime mover to participate to the initial
state of the universe, which is far in the past, by making her choice in the present.
At the level of micro-physics, in MWI, this would work in the following way.
In [50] I proposed that the previous system with which the observed system interacted, usually the preparation device, becomes entangled with the observed system.
This entangled state is a linear combination of tensor products between eigenstates
of the observables and states of the preparation device. When the measurement
is completed, the resulting state is such a term of the product, so that the resulting eigenstate of the observed system is accompanied by a state of the preparation
device, and an interaction between them taking place in a way that can ensure the
conservation laws and even unitarity. For each of these unitary histories, this interaction with the preparation device is like the spontaneous “kick” coming from the
environment and affecting the observed particle, ensuring thereby the unitary evolution for that history, as postulated by Schulman in his “special states” proposal [54].
(Note that if we don’t take into account the past interactions of the observed system,
quantum measurements violate the conservation laws, even if we take the measuring
device into account [25, 55, 56].) Later, motivated as well by recovering the conservation laws, Collins and Popescu rediscovered this solution based on entanglement and constructed a more detailed theoretical model [57]. In the case of MWI,
we can use this proposal to ensure a continuity between Alice choosing coffee and
her past, or Alice choosing tea and her past, so that the choice results from her own
preferences or tendencies. This can accommodate compatibilist free-will, but also
libertarian free-will, if Alice can act as a prime mover unmoved to fill in the blank at
the moment of choice, so that her past micro-state was already leading to her choice.
It can be objected that, even if MWI allows Alice to make both choices, each version of Alice can enjoy the benefits of only one of these choices in each world. This
is consistent with Everett’s idea that each branch correlates with her brain being in a
classical state [26].
Can Alice have the experience of enjoying both worlds at once? Can her mind
be in such a quantum state? My classical mind writing these words is unable to
grasp such a quantum mind, but that’s just my classical mind. Given that any
discussion of free-will is anyway deemed to supplement the physics with metaphysical assumptions, we can as well entertain the metaphysical claim that Alice
is more than we see in a single branch, that it has a super-mind containing the
instances of her classical minds in more branches at once, and maybe unifying
them in a higher form of her self. But perhaps such a speculation is too wild and

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

unnecessary, given that most discussions of free-will make minimal metaphysical
claims, and even those perhaps with the sole purpose of accounting for our experience of freedom. And it is unnecessary to go that far, given that I already gave
a couple of reasons why the many worlds, with their multiple choices for Alice,
don’t constrain her freedom, but they may in fact fulfill it even more.
However, I’d like to add another argument. Libertarian free-will assumes the
existence of possible alternatives from which the agent can choose freely. But
here I think lies another conflict with the physical reality: things either exist or
don’t exist. While we talk about “possibilities”, we don’t know of any example
of something that is neither real, nor unreal, but it is possible. Possibility seems
to be in a realm between real and unreal, and we have neither a physical understanding of this, nor a mathematical model. From a structural-realist [58] point of
view, there is no difference between the structure of a possible world and that of
a real world. And yet, we use the idea of possibility often, in the general guise of
“counterfactuals”. We use counterfactuals when discussing probabilities, because
probabilities are the ratio between the number of possible favorable events and
the total number of possible events, even though only one of these events happened. We use counterfactuals when discussing libertarian free-will, for example
Swinburne wrote in [10], p. 203:
It is natural to suppose that there follows from someone having free will in my
sense a principle called ‘the principle of alternative possibilities’ (PAP) that:
A does x freely only if he could have not done x (i.e. could have refrained from
doing x).
Counterfactuals were used by David Hume to define causality, by stating that an
event x causes another event y if and only if, without x, y would not exist [59].
Counterfactuals were also used to reject the triviality argument against the computational theory of mind. According to Putnam [60] and Searle [61], any physical
system can be interpreted as implementing any computation. One of the attempts to
refute the triviality argument is that a physical system implements a computation
only if it is able to compute for alternative inputs [62, 63].
But how can possible alternatives make sense, if something either exists or it
doesn’t and there is no middle way? And if counterfactuals as possibilities make no
physical sense, how can then libertarian free-will make sense?
David Hume, an important proponent of compatibilism, also thought that everything about the world is determined by the configuration of matter and the distribution of particular events, by facts about objects in space and time, and that there is
no reason to infer from this the existence of causal relations or of fundamental laws
connecting these events. This position, named Humean supervenience, deems as
unnecessary and unwarranted not only the causal relations and the physical laws as
abstract entities connecting the events, but also the possibilities, the counterfactuals,
as pointed out for example by Loewer [64]. This became very clear in David Lewis’s
modal realism, according to which the “possible worlds” should be understood as
being as real as the actual world [65–67]. Then, there is no ground for libertarian
free-will based on alternative possibilities, unless each possible choice is realized in
some existing world. But MWI ensures the existence of other worlds, remaining in

68 Page 14 of 19

the game as a viable physical basis for free-will, and maybe as the only such basis.

2.3  Entanglement in MWI and Free‑Will
Count 3 “When everything is entangled with everything else, in one big monstrous
piece, there is no room left for creativity” (Gisin [1]).
Reply It is said that Leonardo da Vinci worked on the Mona Lisa between 1503 and
1517. An artist tries numerous versions, explores numerous potential worlds in a
single world. MWI may allow different versions of da Vinci, with different versions
of the Mona Lisa, including the one we know. If our own history, with a particular
version of the Mona Lisa, involves creativity, how would the same history lack creativity in MWI, just because multiple other variations happen? If “everything happens” in MWI, how could creativity not happen?
Could it be true that in MWI the histories in which Shakespeare produced randomly both great and bad literature overwhelmingly dominate the multiverse? This,
and even worse, should be the case if all initial conditions would be available. If
MWI gives the same probabilities as standard QM, Shakespeare should create consistently great or consistently bad literature in most histories.
But, as explained in Sect. 2.2, this is not the case: the initial conditions, even for
MWI, have to be severely constrained. Leonardo da Vinci and Shakespeare didn’t
create their works randomly, by making arbitrary choices. They carefully educated
and trained themselves for a long time. Their precision shielded them both from
noise and uncontrollable indeterminism, and from entanglement. And if they did
indeed fill in the blanks in the initial conditions of the universe, they could say along
with the Areopagite, who wrote this a millennium before Michelangelo could have
said it [68],
For this is not unlike the art of those who hew out a life-like image (from
stone), removing from around it all which impedes clear vision of the latent
form, showing its true and hidden beauty solely by taking away
and pruning by this the undesired branches of the wavefunction.
But maybe entanglement introduces additional constraints that should be considered. So how would entanglement limit creativity?
While any interpretation of QM contains entanglement, MWI contains much
more, because it is based on decoherence. In each world, the measured system
is separated from the environment, so each world has the same amount of entanglement as in standard QM. But in the total wavefunction, containing the many
worlds, the observed system is entangled with the environment. Every time new
worlds are created, new entanglement is produced. Standard QM avoids this by collapsing the wavefunction at the end of each measurement, so that in the end the
observed degrees of freedom are not entangled with the environment. But in MWI,
more entanglement is produced with each new measurement. The same amount of
entanglement is present in Bohmian mechanics, which requires the same branching

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

Page 15 of 19 68

structure as MWI, otherwise the “empty branches” will interfere with the one correlated with the Bohmian positions, making the macroscopic objects unstable and
violating the Born rule.
In each world, the entanglement is exactly how it has to be in standard QM. And
what happens in one world is not affected by the other worlds, unless previously
separated worlds interfere again, which would be a bigger problem for MWI than
too much entanglement.
Returning to the “opening” in the causal chain that may be needed for free-will,
in a deterministic world, even with many-worlds, the more ways to fill in the blanks
in the initial conditions, the more possibilities of freedom exist. And entanglement
only adds more possibilities, more parameters with more blanks to be filled in.
If we evolved to use the resources of pseudo-indeterminism like noise, and those
of genuine indeterminism like that resulting from quantum measurements, since
entanglement is also a resource [69], we may as well have evolved to use entanglement too. In fact, entanglement is the main resource on which modern quantum
technologies are based [70]. Whatever abilities we developed during our evolution,
including what we call free-will or creativity, are not due to the subsystems alone
against the environment, but to the complex interplay between them. Are these abilities properties of us as subsystems, or of the whole? If quantum mechanics, in particular its many-worlds interpretation [71], but also Bohmian mechanics [72] taught
us something, is that the universe is an undivided whole. Therefore,
We are interconnected with the rest of the universe, and maybe these connections
enchain us, or maybe we evolved to use them to affect the world.
If, during the evolution of life, this resource of entanglement could be used for
the survival of the individuals and of the species, it was used. But at any rate, if it
was not used, its existence does no harm, and adds no limitation. If creativity is possible in Standard QM, and if any history possible in Standard QM is also possible in
MWI, creativity is possible in MWI as well. 	

3  Conclusions
I tried to take a rather prudent position, by separating the physical from the metaphysical assumptions involved in what is understood by free-will. In this spirit of
prudence and epistemic modesty, I prefer to say that I don’t know what free-will is,
other than my own subjective experience of freedom, which informs, as in the case
of anyone else, my views on this issue. But even with this provision, it is possible to
analyze what types of free-will are consistent with MWI.
I want to emphasize again that libertarian free-will depends on whether the
brain is able to use quantum indeterminism or the branching resulting from decoherence, as a resource in the decision-making processes. Compatibilist free-will
depends on whether the brain is able to realize a chain of commands able to lead
to the desired outcomes, even if noise or genuine indeterminism interfere with
its actions. The article should be understood with these provisions, and with the

68 Page 16 of 19

Foundations of Physics (2024) 54:68

provision that the physical structures don’t have more to bring to the table than
whether their behavior is deterministic or not, and retrocausal or not.
While I defended the compatibility of free-will with MWI, I only expressed
some personal views about logical possibilities, using as a starting point Nicolas Gisin’s excellently written, very concise article. In my opinion, there is much
agreement between my views and his with respect to getting a chance to have
free-will even in an apparantely deterministic but incompletely specified universe. The disagreements come with respect to MWI, about which I argue that it
supports free-will.
In making the case for the compatibility of free-will in MWI, but also when
expressing cautions, I brought some arguments that, to my best understanding, are
novel:
1. Libertarian free-will based on dualism should, from a structural-realist and physicalist point of view, lead to a dynamical system composed of a matter-system and
a mind-system that interact, and it has the same problems as the purely physicalist
or materialist systems regarding the possibility of free-will (Sect. 2.1).
2. Libertarian-style free-will is possible even in a deterministic world, and even in
deterministic many-worlds, if not all parameters were fixed at the Big Bang but
can be fixed later by agents acting as prime movers unmoved (Sect. 2.1).
3. This combines the libertarian and compatibilist types of free-will in a single type
of free-will that has both their advantages (Sect. 2.1).
4. The ability to make multiple choices at once in a non-exclusive way gives us not
less, but rather more freedom (Sect. 2.2).
5. If classical agents can be supported by branches in the wavefunction, maybe
quantum agents, supported on the full wavefunction and supervening over more
branches, are possible as well, but we only experience a “classical component”
(Sect. 2.2).
6. The standard flavors of libertarian free-will require non-physical possibilities to
have a sort of reality that is not quite real, but also not unreal. I side with David
Lewis that this requires possible worlds to be real [65, 66], and I think that MWI
provides a physical basis for this (Sect. 2.2).
7. The huge entanglement present in MWI, rather than limiting our freedom,
could be a resource, a source of more blanks to be filled-in during our choices
(Sect. 2.3).
I conclude that, in my opinion, MWI is compatible with free-will just like other theories and interpretations of quantum mechanics are, with its own flavors that can be
argued to bring some advantages. I’ll let the readers use their free-will to decide if
these arguments are as plausible as the usual arguments for other versions of freewill, and if they bring something both new and useful to the vast and sophisticated
discussion about free-will that is going on since ancient times.

Abstract
In a recent paper as an alternative to models based on the notion of ideal mathematical point, characterized by a property of separatedness, we considered a viewpoint
based on the notion of continuous change, making use of elements of a non-classical
logic, in particular the fuzzy sets theory, with events represented as spatiotemporally
blurred blobs. Here we point out and discuss a number of aspects of this imperfect
symbolic description that might potentially be misleading. Besides that, we analyze
its relation to various concepts used commonly to model physical systems, denoted
by terms like: point, set, continuous, discrete, infinite, or local, clarifying further
how our viewpoint is different and asking whether, in light of our main postulate,
any of these notions, or their opposites, if exist, are in their usual meanings suitable
to accurately describe the natural phenomena.

1 Introduction
There is arguably no empirical evidence, coming from observation or experiment,
that would prove for any natural phenomenon ever observed that it was deterministic (see [1–3] as well as references thereof). For what it would take to consider
such claim ‘proved’? If by ‘determinism’ we understand the possibility to (at least in
principle) predict with certainty a given event, a given value of a physical quantity,
then to prove it, in a given particular case, would be to verify the correctness of a
given prediction. And to verify the correctness of the prediction, what one needs to
do, is to determine exactly the actual value obtained (and compare it with the prediction). Is this ever possible in practice? No measurement (arguably) can be performed

with infinite (or, even, ‘arbitrary’) precision, thus if such precision is required for
the value so determined to be considered exact, then it is clearly not possible. Would
it be possible if no infinite precision were required? The infinite precision of measurement was obviously not needed in order to confirm the predictions (or, perhaps,
suspicions) that, for example, the planetary orbits are not perfect circles, or the distance covered by a body in free fall is not a perfectly linear function of time [4]. Do
results like these two, however, prove that any exact value was actually determined
in the process? Would infinite precision of measurement allow to determine, say, the
exact trajectory as followed by a planet? Does anything like an ‘exact trajectory’, or
exact value of any physical quantity, even exist? The view that values of physical
quantities described by real numbers, with infinite number of digits, do in fact exist,
since they cannot be observed is thus considered merely a theoretical assumption.
What they would entail is a situation where finite volumes of physical space might
contain an infinite amount of information (with ‘information’ understood in physical, ‘embodied’ sense). The limited accuracy of any measurement is typically taken
to define a finite interval, within which more precise values cannot be discerned, i.e.,
determined. If in principle, using some more accurate method or tool, they could
be, then such an ‘indeterminism’ is said to be merely an epistemic one, referring to
our lack of knowledge about the exact state of the system. One could, however, take
such an interval of indeterminacy, purely practical in nature, at its face value, and
posit1 that the values of physical quantities are in themselves of only a finite precision, defining a finite interval associated specifically with each such quantity, which
would thus constitute a genuine, ‘ontic’ indeterminacy (of the quantity’s value). In
such way, certain form of indeterminism is rendered a direct consequence of simply
using a different mathematical notion, perhaps more adequate to describe the natural
phenomena [2]. In result, however, in such an approach, what the putative existence
of systems containing infinite amounts of information tends to be contrasted with, is
‘discrete’ physical systems, containing at most some finite amount of information.
To discern between the two possible options is then considered a problem that could
in principle be decided on empirical grounds, by establishing how much information might in fact be contained in physical systems, i.e., by ‘counting’ some physical
‘bits’ that can be stored within a system and seeing whether their number is bounded
from above [5].
Recall now the main claim considered in [6] that in the natural world there is
no fact of the matter about the spatio-temporal separation of events, or, in other
words, about their separatedness,2 meaning that it is not adequate to represent
and model real world events (or, states) with ideal mathematical points, as current approaches, as we argued therein, tend to do. As an alternative, we considered
instead a viewpoint based on the notion of continuous change (CC), using elements

In the spirit of the approach of eliminating the concepts requiring distinctions that cannot in principle
be observed, and seeing where it might lead (see [1]).

Notion not related (at least not directly) to the one from algebraic geometry with the same name. Not
related also to the separation axioms for topological spaces [7], to the notion of spaces’ [8] or sets’ [9]
separability, nor other notions with names alluding to the commonsense intuition of ‘separation’ between

of a non-classical logic, in particular the fuzzy sets theory, with events represented
as (spatiotemporally) blurred blobs, noting that it entails a certain form of indeterminism. In this regard, thus, it can be seen as leading in a direction similar to the
other approaches in the literature considering different conceptual models of indeterminism. However, does it also suggest, similarly, the kind of indeterminism of
a ‘discrete’ physical system, or maybe something quite different? In general, is this
symbolic description (as developed in [6]) clear, readily comprehensible, and unambiguous, or rather prone to misinterpretations and potentially misleading? Even if it
were the former, is it also clear how exactly it differs from the separatedness-based
framework3 (SF), especially since we adopted and use in different contexts and with
altered meaning some common terms which, when used within the SF, have their
specific definitions (like, among others, change that is claimed to be continuous, or
the use of fuzzy sets)? If so, is it more accurate and thus better than the SF, that is,
does it allow to describe4 the empirical observations and findings in a more natural
(meaning: simpler, more ‘intuitive’, and also more comprehensive) way (and maybe
to make some new testable predictions as well)? Also, is it the only possible alternative view, arising uniquely from negating the SF? And is it entirely clear what
exactly is to be understood by the SF, in the first place?
In the present paper, we will try to clarify: (1) what we think is the essence of the
SF, what kind of concepts it includes, and what exactly are its limits, and, simultaneously, (2) how our model, based on CC, is supposed to be different, and why, and in
what sense, it might be considered an alternative.
Now, to answer the above questions, we need to know first of all what exactly is
the main aspect of the SF that we claim is deficient (in the context of its ambitions
of being a basis for accurate descriptions of natural phenomena) and we are trying
to find an alternative to. Since we insist that it relates to the notion of mathematical
point being its central element, what exactly is to be understood then by the ‘point’
that we keep referring to? Mathematical point is typically considered a primitive
notion being an abstract idealization of an exact position (in physical space, or time,
or in an abstract mathematical space) [10]. It is considered zero-dimensional. It thus
has no shape or size. It is conventional, however, to draw a filled round shape to represent it, as in Fig. 1a. Is this an accurate and/or appropriate representation? Is it a
harmless practice to draw it like this?

3
Alternatively, the term ‘paradigm’ could be used here, although ‘framework’ seems to us more adequate and illustrative, as describing something to which a whole construction is fit and by which it is
supported. Primarily for this reason this latter term is chosen as the one that will be used throughout this
paper.

4
We avoid here using the term explain reserving it for specific physical theories, certain general aspects
of which, for ones finding support in empirical data, we may wish to capture within our viewpoint.

2  What is the Shape of a Mathematical Point
Although it is just a convention, which is not to be taken overly seriously, nonetheless in our view it at least contributes (together with the supposition about its size,
as discussed further below) to two interrelated effects, that is, it: (1) diverts attention
from the essence of the SF’s central notion, and (2) suggests that possible to represent and model accurately within the SF alone might be phenomena which are in
fact not.
The essence of the SF’s central notion, a point (which might represent events,
states, or other abstract objects), is in our view that it is supposed to represent something that is distinct from other points. Primarily and directly, when drawn symbolically on a white piece of paper (as in Fig. 1), it is distinct from the white space
(which might represent an ‘empty’ space, a ‘gap’) that surrounds it. This is the separatedness property: either something is one and the same thing, or not the same and
thus separate, distinct things (as depicted for example in ref. [11]’s Fig. 3A). In the
SF, a point is simply something different, and (which is particularly salient point)
it can be different only along a given specific dimension5 (e.g., along an x-axis,
with some x1 being distinct from x2). When drawn on a plane that is assumed to
be exactly two-dimensional (like the piece of paper), it is something different along
each of the dimensions being represented (in this example along one of the two, that
is, vertically or horizontally), and thus more faithfully to the intent of the SF (and
less deceptively) a point should be depicted as a rectangular shape, as in Fig. 1b.6
The popular round shape is misleading as it ‘distracts’ from this essence of a point
as being simply distinct from others, and, besides that, it suggests that in the SF one
could represent accurately a round shape, that in a sense changes ‘smoothly’, in not
any specific dimension (or, practically speaking, in more than one dimension at a
time, as if it was gradually ‘merging’ together the dimensions).
In fact, within the SF (that is, using only the elements, or ‘building blocks’, that
it offers and permits), it is not possible to represent precisely (that is, with a precision that would be exact and not merely an ‘arbitrary’ one) a curve, which can be
considered as something changing smoothly, in a sense in more than one direction
at once (or, more precisely speaking, in no specific direction), as the one in Fig. 1c,
left. If we assume two dimensions, we are allowed then to take steps from one point
onto another either along horizontal or vertical dimension, but not along the two at
5
Note that there are many different definitions of ‘dimension’ [12]. For example, a topological (covering) dimension of a discrete space of isolated points is considered equal 0. Here, by the number of
dimensions we will mean, somewhat more informally, the minimum number of coordinates needed to
specify any point within a space, with the dimension of a discrete set of points when drawn on a piece
of paper that is assumed to be 2-dimensional being equal 2, with the coordinates of such points defined
possibly as the number of points along a given dimension needed to reach a given point when ‘jumping’
between ‘neighbouring’ points starting from some baseline level. And by dimension itself, we will mean
one of the directions in which one can ‘move’ between the points.
6

‘Moving’ (i.e., when comparing points) along the diagonal, and out of the corner, as one could possibly try here, is not really an option, as what is supposed to be represented here are two distinct dimensions (there is thus no ‘intermediate’ dimension). In fact, when the points represent actual things, this is
not possible due to there being no exact (sub-)point that we consider here a ‘corner’ (of the point), as we
shall discuss in yet more detail later.

Foundations of Physics (2025) 55:1

the same time (Fig. 1c, right). Unless we were rotating the coordinate axes by a certain degree in incremental steps, only then, at each such incremental step, we could
‘move’ along a new dimension, which would be at a certain angle to the preceding
one, ‘visiting’ different points along this new dimension. The variable representing
the angle, however, relative to a baseline level, would itself form a dimension of the
same kind, that is, with the angle value represented at each step again as a distinct
separate point along the angle-axis. To draw a ‘smooth’ curve (in the rather informal sense of a shape with no abrupt, sharp turns) as in Fig. 1c, left, is actually to
just not respect the strict rules of the game as imposed (on itself) by the SF, trying
to prove that possible might be something which in fact is not. One draws what is
assumed to be a smooth curve (which never goes exactly vertically, horizontally, or
in any other specific direction), and then tries to describe it somehow using exact
numbers (represented here by the points’ locations), while they are not applicable
as unable to represent a smooth, gradual change.7 At least part of this illusion (of, at
least, a potential possibility of attaining the exact precision) can be attributed to this
assumption (or, convention), saying that any of the points, being parts of which the
curve supposedly consists, actually has no shape, or can be taken to be of arbitrary
shape, especially round, and thus, as the argument goes, from such points surely we
could construct a ‘smooth’ curvy shape. Another assumption, likely also contributing here, as we have already mentioned, is that those parts have no (or at most ‘negligible’) size.

3  What is the Size of a Mathematical Point
Does it make any sense, however, to represent, and try to ‘reconstruct’, any object,
and especially any real, physically existing thing, with parts which have no size?
While it is far from obvious what is to be understood by “physically existing”, or
by “size”, let us assume for now that something with no size, that is, occupying
literally no part of a relevant space (physical space, or time, or some other abstract
mathematical space), simply does not exist and then there is nothing to talk about.

7
One could suggest, as one of conceivable arguments in defence of SF in this respect, that the curve
depicted in Fig. 1c, left, represents in fact a point in a space with a curvilinear coordinate axis, and it is
distinct (from other points) along one specific (although intrinsically curved) dimension, and such curvilinear system of reference can be defined abstractly, using exact numbers, rebutting thus our claim of
the SF’s capabilities being overrated. Our response to this would be that the point is that what is not possible to represent precisely within the SF is not (an exact value of) an abstract notion of curvature, which
obviously it is, but rather an actual change (note that here, describing change, we do not mean ‘actual’ to
be synonymous with ‘physical’), where a given magnitude never takes any specific value, be it angle, or
curvature, or anything else. In other words, this example with the change of angle (with the curve possibly, but not necessarily, representing some physical motion) is just one specific instance from the general,
abstract class of phenomena in application to which the SF seems to be helpless (albeit undoubtedly
resourceful, always providing one with means to make up to a certain extent for this deficiency, effectively masking its true limits).

It is assumed in the SF that continuous,8 that is, infinitely divisible intervals, consist
of (only) such points with no size (we remark and stress here that CC is not divisible
and thus not continuous in this sense). We posit that, in the SF itself, by virtue of
being something distinct from others (and, primarily, from the surrounding ‘gap’),
any point (assumed therein to be ‘zero-dimensional’) will in fact have a non-zero
size, or in other words, an ‘extension’ (which from the outside, that is, relative to
others, might be arbitrarily small, but evident once the picture is ‘zoomed in’, as
visualized in ref. [11]’s Fig. 3A).
Deliberately and explicitely an ‘extended’ version of ideal point-like objects
seems to be used in certain models being described commonly as ‘discrete’, referring to a version of discreteness that is supposed to describe what might be considered a ‘physical continuum’, that is, a situation where different entities (possibly including events, defined as a spacetime points) can be considered in some
sense (not necessarily amenable to precise definition) to be ‘situated directly next to
each other’. This kind of discreteness means then that an interval (containing some
objects) is not infinitely divisible, but consists instead of some ‘minimal-size’ indivisible units (as in the top two rows in Fig. 1d), with their size expressed (implicitly) in terms of the number of some ‘underlying’ points of certain fixed size (with
the lower bounds on size possibly defined separately, independently for different
such ‘units’). Hoverer, what if what is about to be (conceptually) divided is actually
embedded (in some way) in an ‘underlying’ background (as represented by the bottom row of points, for visual clarity drawn below the other two, in Fig. 1d). Then,
how to choose the origin of the division? For a given origin of partition chosen (as
one of the top two rows in Fig. 1d), some points of the underlying structure will fall
in between and others within the interiors of some of the extended points, with the
latter suggesting that ‘their’ respective extended points could be divided further, as
being embedded in the domain which is ‘more’ divisible, while the former being left
in the ‘void’, not ‘assigned’ to any of the extended points (with this ‘split’ into two
‘kinds’ of underlying points depending on the partition; one could add also a third
kind, of ‘undecided’ points, that is ones partly within an extended point and partly
within the void). Perhaps such an indivisibility would be more justifiable without
such underlying background, when the points to be (potentially) divided are the only
thing there is, like in an abstract graph, as in Fig. 1e. However, in an abstract graph
like this, beside the links (depicted here as the gray rectangular points) there remain
still the ‘gaps’ in between the nodes and the links, with the links themselves being
just like points, with all the ensuing issues.
Actually, in the context of this particular kind of discreteness, it would seem to us
more appropriate to call such extended points (being like, for example, the ancient
notion of atoms, as bits of matter, with minimal assumed sizes) continuous rather
than discrete. For when an individual point is considered in itself, from the ‘inside’,
8
Note that there is also a variety of distinct concepts with names referring to the notion of something
being ‘continuous’ [13, 14]. Here, when referring to the SF, by ‘continuous’ we will mean, again perhaps
rather informally, a property of a collection of objects any subset of which can be put in one-to-one correspondence with a real interval, describing the fact that however short of an interval we took we will
always find that it consists of (relatively) even shorter separate pieces.

1

and not as embedded in some underlying at least potentially more divisible background, then what stands out is its continuity, that is, the ‘connectedness’ (or, ‘persistence’) of the stuff that it represents (in our examples, the black ink used to draw
a point). It is rather in this sense that we call change ‘continuous’. CC would be
thus somewhat more akin to a discrete rather than continuous interval in this regard,
however definitely not in the sense of discretely spaced, isolated points (which are
also assumed to have no size) as discussed next.
Another version of discreteness9 (which, hoverer, may result from the one considered above) might be used to describe a situation where a given quantity can take
only some selected, isolated values, but not others. For all purposes involving the
object or process considered (that is one being described by a given quantity), this
kind of discreteness implies that in between the isolated permitted points (each representing a distinct value) there is an empty space which cannot be occupied, which
however can equivalently be considered as being filled with a kind of ‘invisible’,
‘unattainable’, but extended point of certain size.10 The isolated points themselves
are then assumed to have no size, just like in the continuous case in this regard.
As far as representing natural phenomena with ideal points goes, the essence of
our arguments, as outlined thus far, can pertain to this situation as well (it can be
reduced in particular to the same picture, at least symbolically, that we considered
above in the context of the other version of discreteness, if we swap the ‘colors’ of
points and blank spaces between the points, that is, if we draw white isolated points
on a black piece of paper).
It appears that the notion of size of points (which in practice are always extended,
as we have been arguing) matters only from the ‘outside’, that is, when different
points are compared to one another (from the perspective of a ‘bird’s eye view’), but
not from the ‘inside’ of a point when considered in isolation. This observation could
be used and serve as a basis to posit a relativity of size (somewhat like described in
[17]). According to such a relational approach, the two configurations depicted in
Fig. 1f (assuming for the moment that the gray points are not there) would be identical, and to traverse the distance between the top two points (moving with the same
9

This one being more directly related to what is formally, in the abstract, considered a discrete space
[15]. Again, we hope that we sufficiently faithfully represent how the various mathematics-related terms
and concepts appear to be typically used in different models aimed at describing the physical systems,
however since the issue and question of how exactly a given concept, as used in some practically-oriented model, is related to its formal counterpart, and whether it shares all its particular properties or
consequences, is often left partially or entirely unanswered, maybe for future investigations, as currently
too complex or perhaps irrelevant (for instance, can an actual, i.e., physical, solid object, in three-dimensional space considered continuous, be decomposed into two exact copies, in terms of size, of the original one? [16]), for formal definitions and treatment the interested reader is referred to one of the strictly
mathematics-oriented resources as referenced below or to other, relevant, literature.

10
With any interval of the isolated points corresponding possibly one-to-one to an interval of natural
numbers. In this particular kind of applications such model might describe, to give some examples, the
amount of information, suitably defined, contained within some physical system, or an oscillation that
could occur with only some particular values of frequency but not others (possibly ‘jumping’, in some
way, between the different, spaced values), but not a given system containing different amounts of information, or a given oscillation with different frequencies, actually situated next to itself (whatever that
would mean), as in the ‘continuum’ of different actual entities as described above, which is an important
distinction to keep in mind.

nominal velocity) would take the same amount of time in both the left and the right
configuration, as everything in the right one is a scaled version of the left, including the gaps between the points as well as the definition of a “meter”. This is so,
however, only intrinsically for a given configuration, when it is considered in isolation from others. When the configurations are directly juxtaposed and compared, or
when one is smoothly transitioning into another, then these two configurations are
different, as the existing points need to be enlarged (in a process of some sort) or
new points ‘produced’ and added to the left configuration (as depicted by the small
gray points) in order to obtain the right one and so the considered distance turns into
a relatively larger one (that is, larger when judging its size by counting the number
of points of a given fixed size needed to fill it, which appears to be the common
practice in considerations where such a relativity of size is not posited).

4  Can two Ideal Point‑Like Events Happen Neither at Exactly
the Same Moment of Time Nor at Two Distinct Moments
Is it possible, within the SF, to conceive of an example of ideal point-like events
which happen neither at exactly the same moment of time nor at two distinct
moments (in a given reference frame), thus defying in a way the law of excluded
middle, as targeted in [6],11 while staying within the classical framework with
ideal points? One could try to argue that it indeed is, taking an extended version of
points12 (as in the discrete models of ‘physical continuum’ as discussed above) to
prove the point (Fig. 1g, left, with the time axis to be considered here as going horizontally). What can only be compared in the SF, however, are points situated along
a given specific dimension. That is, what we would need to do in order to be able to
compare the temporal (or any other13) relations of such points in a fair and rigorous
manner (being faithful to the SF), is to move the lower point upwards, so that they
are both on (exactly) the same level. Then, however, they would merge and become
one event, for which we assume it obviously makes no sense to compare its relations
with itself (Fig. 1g, right). The only conclusion that can be drawn in the SF is that
either some points are two distinct points or one and the same point. If one would
like to insist (focusing on the left part of the Fig. 1g as it is) and argue that clearly,
one end(-point) of the lower point falls within the interior of and its other end(point) falls beyond the upper one, we would respond that, in fact, the exact ‘end’ of
the object being represented by the extended point, as a point itself, is something
which does not really exist, and it is not in any specific place (neither is any specific
(sub-)point of the ‘interior’ of any of the extended points), and so it just does not
11

And also in other approaches positing certain forms of indeterminism, although in somewhat different
ways (see [18]).

12
‘Extended’ numbers akin to this kind of extended points seem to appear in certain approaches, considered nonstandard, to analysis (discussed also in [19]), where they are meant to represent an increment (of
a variable’s value).
13

In fact the discussion in this paragraph could apply as well to, for example, spatial relations between
events, if we assumed instead that the horizontal direction in Fig. 1g represents a spatial, rather than temporal, dimension.

1

make sense for such exact points that do not exist to be strictly compared. It is only
an assumption of the SF that such specific positions can indeed be determined. One
could argue here, however, that the same can be said about and applied to the situation when two such points are on the same level (even when merged, as in Fig. 1g,
right), and then they also cannot be compared because they are not in any specific
positions either. With such observation of the reader we would agree, and add that
this is an artificial construct of the SF in which the only thing we can say, and are in
fact obliged to decide on, is whether two objects are distinct and thus not the same
object or, alternatively, the same object, and this requirement is (symbolically) represented strictly and fulfilled only when they are situated along one selected dimension (that is, having x1 vs x2). As discussed already above, we regard this kind of
SF’s ‘extended’ points, as considered here, equivalent to ‘ordinary’ points, assumed
commonly to be non-extended (identified possibly with exact, specific locations in
an infinitely divisible continuum), in that their essence is to represent distinct, separate objects. The point of our alternative (CC) view is rather that there are no such
specific, exact points.
In general, in the SF, if there actually were to be no not-so-well-defined ‘emptiness’ between neighbouring points, the points would need to be packed so densely
that there are no gaps between them (no ‘white’ space between ‘black’ points). Then,
however, they would become simply one point.14 It seems that there is just no third
way within the SF and, because of this, we would argue, oftentimes we are forced to
deal with all “how many angels can dance on the head of a pin”-sort of ‘problems’.

14
To get rid of the emptiness, and arguably of any ‘borders’ between the points as well, while retaining distinct points, one could argue that it is the adjacent points themselves, constituting a continuous
interval, that might be represented by the alternating black and white colors. We respond to this, hoverer, that the colors and the way we choose to color the points representing some concrete things can be
arbitrary, and if the supposedly adjacent points were ‘touching’ tightly, then, again, they would in fact
be one point. Undoubtedly oversimplifying greatly, we could also remark here that if there were to be
regions in the natural world with different matter density, with matter represented by the ‘static’ points,
without the emptiness, there would need to be points of somehow different kinds, with different intrinsic
‘physical’ properties, that is lighter or heavier (whatever that would mean). Obviously some, if not most,
of these considerations and argumentations of ours concerning the SF resemble, or overlap with, some
quite ancient ones, that can be found already in Aristotle when objecting to the notion of void separating the atomists‘ atoms, or Pythagoreans’ numbers (of which they believed matter literally consits) [4].
We would like to avoid thus going even more deep into deliberations of these matters and reinventing
the wheel by inadvertently repeating arguments that most likely can be found in some old texts. Instead,
let us just indicate that some of those arguments might as well apply to what is commonly considered as
continuous intervals (as suggested, primarily in relation to the concept of time, also in [19]), and then
focus on doing some constructive work (or, at least, suggest that such a work should, and perhaps can, be
done), that is, departing from what we stated as our main postulate, try to see whether and how it can be
developed into some intelligible model and whether it might consequently turn out fruitful in describing
various observed phenomena.

5  Are Real Events Spatio‑Temporally Distributed and Overlapping
Like Fuzzy Sets
The CC viewpoint posits instead that events are not like ideal points, with their specific positions, but rather that their persistence can be considered graded, as represented with the use of fuzzy sets and (“spatiotemporally”) blurred blobs [6].15
However, is it supposed to mean that those grades of events’ persistence will take
specific values at distinct points? Reference [6]’s Fig. 1 might be misleading in that
it suggests a picture of a function taking specific values at distinct specific points
of a domain, that is, a specific value of the ‘membership’ function assigned to each
point of the domain (constituted presumably by the points of a spacetime, that is, by
some ‘underlying’ events), with the ‘strength’ of an event’s persistence being equal,
for example, 0, 0.5, 0.99, or 1, as in Fig. 1h (which describes the situation equally
well even if we assume that these are values of a ‘density’ function, as long as we
insist on having specific values).16 In contrast to that, the ‘persistence’ of events in
our viewpoint is to be taken rather as having no specific value at any point. Consequently, one cannot take a strict cut-off over or below a given value, e.g., selecting
points with f (x) > 0.5 (to determine the, approximate but nonetheless strict, extent
of one event; and the very same argument would apply if one tried to supplement
here the symbol ‘>’ with ‘=’). Also, it is not possible, for example, to take a strict
intersection of two or more events, finding points where the corresponding functions
would overlap (by taking the lowest value at each point), as there can be no two
or more distinct objects, or functions (representing some actual objects) defined, at
exactly the same point17 (due to there being, in the first place, no exact points strictly
distinct from others, and thus no functions to be defined at such points).

6  Do Events Occur Next to Each Other in Space and Time
What is to be conveyed by the use of fuzzy sets and the blobs, is rather that there is
simply no clear-cut separation (of CC) into distinct events, that CC does not require
from us deciding on whether it is one or multiple events, as it is better seen as a
continuous ‘interaction’ (with the exact sense of this term as used in this context
remaining to be specified), and even when it tends to ‘separate out’ what can be considered distinct events, they will still ‘permeate’ the rest, in a manner that, we posit,
might be considered graded.
Figure like the Fig. 1e might suggest a picture where, according to the SF, events
sit in a net of events, hold tightly and defined by (links with) other events. At the
15

With a similar notion, of vague, indeterminate intervals, or regions, proposed to describe the physical
quantities, and location in spacetime in particular, considered also in [20].

16
On such strict assignment of specific values appear to be based approaches in various areas of what is
called fuzzy mathematics (deriving from [21] and, more fundamentally, multi-valued logics).
17
As opposed to the SF where, typically, it is considered possible for two or more physical (althought to
what extent they can be considered ‘physical’, instead of merely ‘abstract’, is not always, if ever, obvious)
objects to be at exactly the same point (one specific example of a pair of such objects might be a spacetime metric and matter).

1

Page 12 of 21

same time, if the gaps are taken to represent an empty space (whatever it would
mean), it might equally well suggest a picture in which each event is detached from
the rest and occurs fully independently. CC, in contrast, is to be seen as neither a
rigid structure nor fully independent events separated and detached from the rest.
There is no clear-cut separation (‘spatial’ or ‘temporal’, or otherwise) between
events, they thus do not form a collection of neighbouring points being distinct
along a specific dimension, with (more ‘fine-grained’) points where one would end
or begin and with empty spaces between them (or, neither, with exact points of a
‘weaker’ persistence of events). The blobs depicted next to each other, as in ref. [6]’s
Fig. 1, might be misleading in this regard (even if accompanied by a disclaimer saying that it is supposed to present an idealized situation, taken to the extreme, which,
importantly, is qualitatively different from what we are trying to describe with this
model), as putting them next to each other implies a specific dimension along which
they would be distinct.18 CC instead is what can be considered a ‘smooth’ change.

7  Where do Events Persist
What can be considered spatial or temporal (or some other) separations likely
emerge (in a graded manner) from CC, depending on events, and so events themselves do not ‘occur’, that is, persist and change, in space or time (in the sense of
them being akin to points in, or of, an abstract mathematical space, which could
represent a space and time, or spacetime). For instance, if I went now to what I consider to be the office (or some other place) where the author of ref. [21] was in what
I consider to be a distant past writing his paper (or at least some part of it) I would
not ‘meet’ him there, but this does not mean that the event of him writing the paper
is not persisting (and, of course, changing) in a certain way,19 in what can possibly
be considered more of a ‘present’ by some other ‘observers’.

18
Taking the example considered above based on Fig. 1c, left, it would be therefore not quite right if
one tried to represent a process as described by the curve (or, alternatively, the process of constructing
the curve per se), using for example the (rather abstract) angle, starting from the ‘bottom’ of the curve,
as a series of blobs situated next to each other on an angle-axis (or angle-time-plane), possibly ordered
by some parameter, with a first blurred blob in the series ‘centered’ on an angle value representing moving in the vertical direction (but encompassing in a graded manner more than one value), the last blob
centered on the horizontal direction, and the other ones centered on the intermediate values between the
exactly vertical and the exactly horizontal ones, respectively. For such a separation into distinct blobs (as
represented by the ordering parameter) would itself need to be considered graded, suggesting in our view
that the very notion of a collection (of blobs situated next to each other) is simply not quite appropriate
(and the same objection would apply if instead of ‘angle’, considered here abstract, we took an axis of, a
spatial, ‘ x1’, ‘ x2’,..., or any other relevant variable).
19
Perhaps like what we consider ‘memories’, which in such view could persist (and change), but not
in space or time (and also not ‘arising’ through simple ‘re-creations’ of matter configurations similar to
some past ones), meaning that what by some ‘observers’ is considered a ‘past’, or as we should rather
say–more of a ‘past’, might in a certain sense be considered ‘open’ (in this connection see also [22] and
references thereof).

8  Do Events Proceed in a Sequence
Reference [6]’s Fig. 1 might be misleading also in that it suggests a direction (by
its use of the single-headed arrows), as if events emerging from CC were occurring
in a sequence.20 However, the primary focus of the CC viewpoint is on the separation process itself (as depicted with the double-headed arrow in Fig. 1i), likely
being more essential. ‘Spatial’ or ‘temporal’ (or some other) nature of a separation
between what is considered separate events, or direction of such separation, may be
relative (dependent on a perspective, defined in some way), undefined, or possess
yet some other characteristics. Our viewpoint remains rather agnostic and does not
say anything specific about the direction or nature (or lack thereof) of such separation, that is besides its ‘graded’ and/or ‘subjective’ nature and its ‘scale’.
Regarding the latter of these aspects, we can note that relatively more ‘rapid’ or
‘slow’ changes will determine different scales (as modeled in Fig. 1i by the length of
the arrow, being proportional to the blob’s ‘diameter’). A slower change results in a
‘stronger’, more direct interaction with what is considered more ‘distant’ events, that
is, distant when assessed using a scale determined by some relatively more rapid
change. This does not mean, however, that what is considered a temporal history
or space should be seen as composed of a multitude of small bits of rapid changes
arranged next to each other (akin to the ideal points of SF), with bits of empty space
in between, possibly superimposed on a background constituted by a separate slower
change (as could be suggested by ref. [6]’s Fig. 1e).

9  Does Everything Happen All at Once
On the picture of neighbouring distinct points based is a notion of ‘locality’, in the
sense of interaction only between neighbouring points, that is such situated directly
next to each other (namely, with no other points in between), with the possible interactions between objects considered as not neighbouring termed action at a (potentially also temporal) distance [23, 24]. Such a distance can be considered a measure
of numerosity of a collection of points of a given fixed size, as discussed already
above, and thus our considerations pertain also to this notion of locality. The essential questions, in light of the above considerations, is how and to what extent events
get separated, becoming distinct, and ‘individuated’ (and remain so21) [25]. Also,
perhaps relatedly, how different events, or what is considered to be objects located in
different places (and/or times), can appear similar, that is, share certain properties,
which allows to assign them to certain classes and describe their behavior (at least
approximately) with the same laws. In this context, we note that CC is (inherently)
20
Or—assuming SF’s ideal point-like events, if we wished to consider only a situation where identical
events should not repeat, and in assessing whether two events are identical or not do not take into account
their relation to other events, i.e., what we could consider their spatio-temporal location, but only their
(putative) ‘intrinsic’ features—as a directed set, rather than sequence.
21
And, then, how emerges what appears to be the kind of motion (or, in general, change) that is called
loco-motion, motus localis, in the sense of specific objects changing place over time [4].

1

Page 14 of 21

a sort of interaction, and thus events need to be consistent, across both what is considered ‘space’ and ‘time’. For instance, when I take a left turn (instead of a possible
right) at a three-way corridor intersection, then in what I might consider the ‘future’
the world will necessarily (if only the events obey the relevant laws of physics) need
to find itself in a situation with myself inside the left corridor. If at some point I find
myself entering the left corridor at this intersection (arriving via the same route as in
the example above), then in what I might consider the ‘past’ I have necessarily had
to take the left turn. When I take the left turn, all events, however distant they could
appear, need to agree and align with myself entering and occupying some space
inside the left corridor (with all the events described in these examples to be understood in terms of CC). It does not mean, however, that everything occurs all at once,
as in our viewpoint there is no notion of ‘every-thing’ (i.e., all the distinct things;
unless in some meta-physical sense, which we cannot, or rather should not, rule out
a priori [26]), and also no notion of ‘at once’ (i.e., a single separate moment).

10  Is the Separation of Events Graded and/or Subjective
We considered in [6] the events, as emerging from CC, to be related to, or dependent
on, a subjective perspective, calling them ‘neutrally’ subjective, meaning that potentially everything can consitute an ‘observer’22 of events. The separation (or, detachment) of distinct events, in turn, we considered as a (potential) process that might
be, at least to some extent, objective. How exactly, however, is this objectivity (and
subjectivity) to be understood? In order to specify and clarify this point, we could
ask the following questions: will other (potentially all) observers agree on whether
a subjective event of one of the observers is occurring? would they agree on how
exactly it is occurring (that is, how is it like, how does it ‘look’ like, metaphorically
speaking)? According to the CC viewpoint, different observers will observe different events, ‘filtering out’ and ‘integrating’ different ‘portions’ of CC, depending on
the observer including its history and thus structure, with the resulting events being
to some extent ‘detached’ from the rest, and thus others cannot know exactly how
a subjective event of a given observer is like. However, if the separation is graded
(in a certain sense), then each such event still ‘interacts’ with and to some degree
affects all the rest, and hence other observers can always in principle know that it
(or, rather, something) is occurring (but not when or where exactly it is occurring).
Is the separation into distinct events indeed graded, that is, stronger or weaker
(and, then, how is this ‘strength’ to be understood)? If so, is it graded objectively,
that is, will other observers agree that a given event (or, at least, some, not necessarily the same according to different observers, events) are more or less separated
and distinct from the rest? Can it be graded subjectively, that is, with an observer
considering a given event as more or less separated, independently from the other
22
Instead of the term ‘subject’, which we have tried to avoid thus far, we adopt here the term ‘observer’,
with the exact meaning of the term and process of ‘observing’, which is not necessarily to be a purely
passive one, and in particular to what extent it overlaps with or replaces in such description the process
of ‘experiencing’ that we have considered before, remaining to be specified.

Foundations of Physics (2025) 55:1

Page 15 of 21 1

observers’ ‘opinion’ on this matter? Does it then correspond to a more ‘intrinsic’
or ‘extrinsic’ mode of ‘observation’ of events? Could it involve ‘illusions’ of some
sort? Also, how, and in what sense, would such more or less separated events ‘persist’ (and ‘change’)? In any case, without trying to answer these complex questions
here, such a degree of separation of events could be modeled adjusting the relative
color intensities of the double-headed arrow (with heads pointing in opposite directions, symbolizing the separation process), and the loop, as in Fig. 1i, bottom (the
color intensities of the tangent circles relative to each other are determined by the
blob’s diameter, that is, its scale, and so all should change roughly proportionally).

11  Discussion
11.1  Does Negating the Static Separatedness of Points Lead Uniquely
to the Dynamic CC
Does negating the ‘static’ picture of the SF imply the ‘dynamic’ CC?23 Is it a unique
alternative, or are there others? In other words, if we deny the existence of specific,
separate objects (with ‘object’ understood in the broad sense of the term), do we
automatically end up with the notion of CC? Or, one might wonder, in the first place,
is there anything left then? As to this latter point, what is left seems very concrete
indeed, for think of the curve from our example above (going right and downwards,
clearly), or, to give another example, the BZ reaction as observed unfolding on a
Petri dish.24 The central issue is in our view this: how it is that the natural phenomena seem so concrete, so ‘vivid’, yet (arguably) they are never in any specific state.
As to the former question, if we assume a simple operation of negation (as in statements like, e.g., x1 does not belong to a set X, x1 is not equal x2) then we consider it
a part of the SF, for which we seek an alternative in the first place. Thus, we posit
that there is more to actual change, and to our model, based on ‘CC’, which tries to
describe it with the notion of an inherent persistence and change (of ‘events’), than
such a simple negation of the SF. It is simply different, but we consider it an open
question how exactly it is different, although tend to see it as a sort of generalization, with the separation of distinct points, which would neither change nor persist,
not ‘interacting’ with the rest, being certain approximation (never realized exactly)
and perhaps only a small subset of the domain that we are trying here to find a way
of thinking about and describing. How does this approach of ours relate to others, in
particular such concerned with the very concept of ‘point’?

23
‘Dynamic’ (‘static’) typically means something that does (not) change over time (or, in general, at
transitions from one state to another). For discussions on whether an event (or time) in itself, when there
is no independent passage of time, can be considered ‘dynamic’ (or likewise ‘static’) see [11, 19]. In
short, the solution to this problem is in our view simply to find some better term that will work for the
reader (our take: ‘(not) continuously changing’). The point is that CC is simply something different from
the familiar picture of states situated next to each other (possibly at distinct instants of time).
24
Here we suggest to consider our perception of color as sort of a dynamical variable, somewhat like
advocated for example in Mach’s ‘phenomenalism’ [4].

11.2  Are Fuzzy or Point‑Free Frameworks Free from Ideal Points‑Like
Separatedness
To our knowledge and understanding, different areas of what is called fuzzy mathematics, as well as different point-free frameworks25 (with various motivations
behind their development, and being studied from different perspectives), from our
perspective and for our purposes do not go far enough in this regard and are not free
from the property of separatedness (which always sneaks in one way or another, as
soon as we try to conduct any practical reasoning). What some of these approaches
(like the ones described in [27]) have in a sense in common with ours (regardless of
the rather specific, general definition of ‘point’ that we employ here), is that they try
to derive the notion of point from some other, more basic ones (in our case arguably
also a more intuitive).
A specific, separate event, as posited in our viewpoint, can be considered, in a
sense, as something that tends to be realized, but is never actually realized in an
exact form. It thus could be seen as being ‘potential’, as opposed to (fully) ‘actual’.
Such perspective relates our view also to the approach (as developed in the line of
work described in [2, 18]) which considers so-called propensities, describing a ‘tendency’ of specific events (i.e., values of physical quantities) to be actualized (at specific instants of time), with this tendency (or, potentiality) taken as being something
physically real. When adopted in our viewpoint, however, what would remain from
this is the (varied) tendencies (being ‘stronger’ or ‘weaker’, or, more or less actualized), which never get fully actualized into some specific values, at any specific
instants, and, moreover, with those tendencies themselves never having any specific
value (recall the discussion above in relation to our use of the fuzzy sets, which, in
its essence, could be applied here as well), and their being more or less ‘actual’ perhaps having a ‘subjective’ aspect to it (as discussed above).
11.3  Can We Possibly Conceive an Accurate Mathematical Model of the Physical
World that Would not Contradict Our Direct Experience of this World
One could argue that it is not well justified (in light of lessons from the history of
science) to expect from a serious model, or theory, aspiring to be accurately describing the natural world to agree with our intuitions based on our direct experience of
this world (on which we insist here). After all, one could point out, for example, that
the heliocentric model, undoubtedly more convenient and thus appropriate than its
direct rival, the geocentric one, does not agree with our perceptions and experience
of the world, since it contradicts the (common) observations of the sun raising in
the east in the mornings and then moving along the immobile Earth. We can use
this particular example, however, to further clarify what is supposed to be meant
by ‘direct’ experience. To this end, we would argue that no one, including people
unaware of the heliocentric model, has ever experienced directly the planet Earth at
25

Like geometries (which take, for example, the connection, ‘link’, suitably defined, between certain
objects, rather than the objects themselves, as a primary notion) [27], or topology [28], doing without the
notion of point (at least as a primitive, primary one).

Foundations of Physics (2025) 55:1

Page 17 of 21 1

rest at the center of the cosmos (or any system) with sun revolving around it (as was
posited by the geocentric model). Rather, what can only be observed directly, is the
sun moving continuously relative to Earth (e.g., falling into the horizon) [4]. In other
words, models like both of these two,26 even the one considered more ‘intuitive’, are
essentially abstract models, constructed by fitting certain direct observations into the
SF and thus describing them by abstract concepts not easily reconciliable with our
direct experience.
More adequate approach would be to try to find means of description of the world
such that, in the first place, our direct experience of the world so described can be
the way it is. The essential aspect of this experience is, in our view, what we might
consider its ‘flow’ (taken to be an actual change), capturing of which is the main
(positive) ambition of CC. Does the CC viewpoint, however, besides potential realization of this aspiration, allow also to capture and describe (at least certain aspects
of) the empirical observations and findings obtained in other, more indirect ways,
and make some new testable predictions, in particular predictions (or explanations)
of shortcomings of certain current methods and theories (perhaps related to their
inadequacy stemming from them being used to domains beyond the scope of their
applicability)?
11.4  Could We Determine the Values of Any Physical Quantities with Arbitrary
Precision
One of predictions (or, explanations) suggested by the CC viewpoint is that models
based on the SF’s notion of ideal point, trying always to determine and ‘pinpoint’
specific separate points in actual phenomena (that is, specific values of quantities
describing a physical system), will fail when encounter the actual change instead.
This will happen more readily when dealing with what can be considered relatively
small, rapidly changing events, as for us, from our perspective, they can be ‘seen’
directly and thus studied more easily, appearing as if they indeed constituted separate events, or objects (as seen under the microscope). This part of the ‘prediction’ appears to be, in fact, accurate, as suggested by empirical findings [29]. However, the same prediction pertains also (as suggested also in [19]) to models of this
kind when applied to relatively large, slowly changing events, and their (potential)
attempts of representing and describing such events with the use of ideal points and
treating thus as separate entities, for instance, a ‘chair’, ‘table’, or ‘planet’ (and perhaps what could be considered a whole ‘space’ itself). Why, then, one could object,
such objects seem to be spatially and temporally relatively precisely located and separate? In our view this is because they do not change (relatively) rapidly, that is, they
are more ‘blurred’, ‘integrating’ over larger (‘time’ and ‘space’) intervals. A chair is
something that we do not see directly. What we can see more readily are what can be
considered parts (more rapidly changing) of which it is supposedly composed. That
something cannot be seen ‘under the microscope’, however, does not necessarily
26

Perhaps, to be somewhat more precise and avoid potential confusion, we should in this example speak
of helio- (resp. geo-) static, rather than centric, models. In any case, for the technical and historical
details the reader is referred to [4] and references thereof.

1

mean that it does not exist. We can experience the undoubted existence of some
chair by, for instance, sitting on it.
The proper domain and scope of applicability of methods (like calculus [30, 31]),
models, or rules and laws, based on the SF’s notion of ideal point, is simply limited.
We have tried here to clarify why we think this is so and specify what is its extent
and what might lie beyond it. In particular, since laws based on the SF are ultimately
an abstraction [32], they will change with events.27 The interesting questions we
could ask in this context are: how, and how ‘rapidly’.
11.5  How Rapidly are Specific Laws Changing
In order to address the latter of these two questions, and establish the bounds on the
rates of change of specific laws, one could compare the results of experiments considered analogous performed at different points in time or space (in a given ‘reference frame’), taking into consideration the accuracy with which the measurements
were made as well as the size of the relevant interval between ‘consecutive’ measurements. In principle, relatively those rates might seem to be ‘infinitely’ low, with
the laws appearing thus as non-changing. In practice, however, one should rather
expect that they will be bounded from below (in a graded manner) by some ‘slowest’ CC. But what does our viewpoint have to say, one could ask, about the content
of the particular laws?
11.6  Why Do We Observe and Remember Only the Kinds of Events that We Do
and Not Others
Why do we observe, and remember, only certain kinds of events and not others? For
instance, we can observe the process of a glass breaking into pieces when dropped
on the ground from a sufficient height, but typically we do not observe the pieces
of a shattered glass getting spontaneously, by themselves, put back together. In our
view, this is simply because the observed phenomena follow the laws of physics. In
this particular case, the relevant laws happen to say that it is possible for a glass to
break into pieces when dropped on the floor from a considerable height, and that it
is highly unlikely (if not impossible) for pieces of broken glass to re-arrange spontaneously. We may however eventually observe such an unlikely process (but perhaps not anytime soon), if only it is permitted by relevant laws. The CC viewpoint
remains rather salient and does not say anything specific about the content of such
specific laws in this regard. What it does say, however, is that when such a potential
phenomenon actually occurs, that is, pieces of broken glass getting put back together
spontaneously (or, similarly, a glass breaking down), it will always be a CC, which
does not have an inherent direction, but which persists (and changes) and thus can be
considered ‘irreversible’ (in addition to its being ‘indeterministic’).
27
To be precise, what we mean here is that with time (or as we should rather say–gradually) different (or, modified) abstract laws are needed to describe the current events at least as accurately, not that
laws themselves, as abstract mathematical entities, change. The question of whether or how exactly the
abstract mathematical objects can be said to ‘exist’ is not our primary concern here.

11.7  How Indeterministic Might Indeterminism Be
We pointed out and discussed here the reasons why certain aspects of our viewpoint
(as described in [6]) might be ambiguous and potentially misleading, and did so,
rather than specifying what exactly it is, primarily by trying to clarify what it is
not, how it should not be interpreted, analyzing its relation and, for the most part,
putting it in opposition to various notions used commonly as bases of models with
ambitions of describing accurately certain physical systems and natural phenomena
in general. This mostly negative approach stems from our conviction that the potential usefulness of the viewpoint considered here lies primarily in indicating what
are the proper questions to ask, rather than giving definite specific answers. This
view, in turn, is based in particular on the conclusion that as an essential element
this viewpoint posits certain form of what we can consider an indeterminism. First
of all, thus, we should clarify how indeterministic this indeterminism might be, that
is, what exactly might be its nature and its extent, and this (or a step in such direction, at least) is what we attempted in the present paper. Such approach situates our
considerations in the broader context of the discussions on (in)determinism in physics, in line especially with the other works proposing different conceptual models
accounting for certain forms of indeterminism, showing that some physical theories might be compatible with—while certain empirical observations and features of
other theories might actually stem or be derived from—such models (rather than the
other way round, namely, with indeterminism being supposedly a unique feature present in only certain phenomena and so appearing specifically in the theories describing such a phenomena) [2, 3, 20]. We outlined here, however, why in our view the
indeterminism (of the natural world) might, in a sense, be even ‘more’ indeterministic than it is posited in these other approaches, suggesting its ‘dynamic’ nature,
namely, its resulting from what we referred to as the ‘actual change’, with variables
describing the physical systems never taking any specific values (and with no specific, separate variables, that would describe such systems, in the first place). As
such, in itself, a model of this kind, as our CC, will perhaps not have any immediate
practical applications, but it might be useful indirectly, by potentially sparing certain misdirected efforts, informing various attempts of constructing specific physical
theories about those of their aspects that are particularly questionable, suggesting
what is most likely futile and what not to expect from the natural phenomena, and
indicating some more promising directions of inquiry. It suggests, in particular, not
to expect an actual existence (i.e., in the sense of ‘ontology’) of things like: strictly
separate systems, specific instants of interactions between such separate systems,
specific states of systems, different exact probabilities of such states being observed
by an observer, deterministic evolution or transitions between such states, or specific
events (or, values of physical quantities) observed by an observer (nor possible alternative events observed by other, ‘branching-off’, strictly distinct observers).

12  Conclusion
Is the natural world static and immobile or rather in a state of constant flux. Does
it consist of discrete bits of matter floating suspended in a void, or of continuous
fields. From objects, or processes. Beings, or becoming. Is it rather discrete, or continuous. All those views (with some of them, sometimes, but not always, considered
as opposite of each other), if formulated in terms of the ideal mathematical points,
being fit into the SF, have a common underlying assumption which we see as a not
necessarily well-justified one, and, let us conclude, it is simply good, on many levels, to be aware of it.

New Foundations for
Branching Space-Times

Abstract.
The theory of branching space-times, put forward by Belnap (Synthese 92,
1992), considers indeterminism as local in space and time. In the axiomatic foundations of
that theory, so-called choice points mark the points at which the (local) possible future can
turn out in diﬀerent ways. Working under the assumption of choice points is suitable for
many applications, but has an unwelcome topological consequence that makes it diﬃcult
to employ branching space-times to represent a range of possible physical space-times.
Therefore it is interesting to develop a branching space-times theory without choice points.
This is what we set out to do in this paper, providing new foundations for branching spacetimes in terms of choice sets rather than choice points. After motivating and developing the
resulting theory in formal detail, we show that it is possible to translate structures of one
style into structures of the other style and vice versa. This result shows that the underlying
idea of indeterminism as the branching of spatio-temporal histories is robust with respect
to diﬀerent implementations, making a choice between them a matter of expediency rather
than of principle.
Keywords: Indeterminism, Branching histories, Choice points, Topology, Local Euclidicity, Hausdorﬀ property.

Motivating a Formal Theory of Indeterminism in Space-Time

The theory of branching space-times (henceforth BST) considers local indeterminism in space and time. Indeterminism is the thesis that a system has
more than one alternative possible future evolution. In BST, the emphasis
is on the divergence of alternative evolutions occurring in small regions of
space and time that can be idealized to be just point events. From the perspective of BST as put forward by Belnap [1], which we will denote BST92 ,
indeterminateness gives way to determinateness at point events.
A focus on local aspects of indeterminism is by no means peculiar to the
BST92 analysis of indeterminism. It is quite typical for questions of where
and when to come up in indeterministic contexts. We ask, for instance, where
and when a person decided on a particular course of action. Or, in a sciencerelated context, we may wonder at which location, and from which instant

on, it has been determined that an electron passing a Stern-Gerlach device
would be deﬂected in a given direction. The naturalness of such questions
indicates, we believe, that an adequate analysis of indeterminism needs to
pay attention to local details of indeterminism: where, when, and how alternative evolutions diverge. These questions are pressing, no matter whether
one prefers to analyze indeterminism in terms of branching possible histories, like in BST92 , or in terms of non-overlapping segment-wise isomorphic
possible scenarios of the Lewis tradition.
The question of what the branching of possible histories looks like at
the local level is diﬃcult to answer. BST92 , being a rigorous axiomatic theory, decides the question of how branching occurs via one of its axioms: in
BST92 , the overlap of two possible histories always has a maximal element.
The opposite option would be for the diﬀerence of two histories to always
have a minimal element. Which option is right? Or maybe this cannot be decided, or an answer to the question can be avoided altogether? The present
paper shows how to avoid taking sides, in the following sense. First, we
present a number of theorems that show that the second option mentioned,
branching of histories without maximal elements, can be worked out in a
formally precise way.1 Second, we show that there is a systematic way of
translating branching structures of one kind into branching structures of
the other kind. In this sense, we can leave it open what branching is really
like. For both steps, the notion of a transition structure, which represents
local indeterminism, is crucial.2
A key motivation for working out an ecumenical position is that we do
not want to press any global argument for preferring one of the two options
mentioned above. We acknowledge that there are valid reasons in favor of
both. In the original paper developing BST92 [1], the decision in favor of
maxima in the intersection of histories is commented as follows:
Finally, let me explicitly note that on the present theory [. . . ],
a causal origin has always ‘a last point of indeterminateness’ (the
choice point) and never ‘a ﬁrst point of determinateness’. I ﬁnd the
matter puzzling since it’s neither clear to me how an alternate theory
would work nor clear what diﬀerence it makes. [1, 428]
1
Technically, we oﬀer a way of replacing the prior choice principle PCP92 of Belnap [1],
Deﬁnition 6, with a new version, PCPNF , via Deﬁnition 18.
2
Transition structures ﬁgure prominently in the work of Rumberg [19, 20]; see also
Rumberg and Zanardo [21]. These works focus mainly on semantics and proof theory,
and they consider transitions in the simpler framework of so-called branching time, not
branching space-times.

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

This feeling of puzzlement also stands behind some objections to BST92 : the
objectors ask what the reasons are for assuming one pattern of branching,
or they are skeptical whether that pattern is compatible with the physics of
space-time.3 Thus, it seems prudent not to decide the matter of patterns of
branching by ﬁat, at least not in advance of some further considerations of
theoretical physics.
A second motivation for this paper stems from topological consequences
of preferring one option over the other, and relates to topological requirements standardly imposed on the mathematical structures used in physics
for representing space-times, so-called diﬀerential manifolds. In this context, it is perhaps worth observing that BST92 is not meant to be a theory
of physics, for two reasons. On the one hand, its axioms are too frugal to be
speciﬁc enough for a direct application in physics. On the other hand, BST92
explores the combination of space-time and modality, and that combination
does not fall into the standard repertoire of physics. Thus, general relativity
represents the evolution of single space-times, whereas branching structures
aim to accommodate multiple alternative space-times. In BST92 one should
thus not expect to ﬁnd the same representational mathematical structures
as in physics, since these structures represent diﬀerent aspects of spatiotemporal reality. But of course, some way of combining these endeavors is
desirable.
Now, a diﬀerential manifold used in physics to represent a space-time
has two properties that are hard to satisfy in branching structures. First, by
deﬁnition, a diﬀerential manifold is locally Euclidean, which means that each
point of the manifold has a neighborhood that can be mapped continuously
onto an open subset of Rn (in realistic applications n = 4; see Section 3.2 for
the deﬁnition). In this way, points in the manifold can be assigned spatiotemporal coordinates via so-called charts. A BST92 structure, however, is
not locally Euclidean with respect to its natural topology (barring trivial
one-history cases). The reason is that a neighborhood of a maximal element
in the intersection of two histories cannot be appropriately mapped onto Rn .
We thus face a problem when trying to assign spatio-temporal coordinates
to the elements of a BST92 structure. To address this problem, we will
develop a version of BST without maximal elements in the intersection of
histories. The natural topology on such structures stands a chance of being
locally Euclidean. We are also interested in ﬁnding an operation that would

See, e.g., Earman [6]. Jeremy Butterﬁeld asked about reasons to assume non-Hausdorﬀ
branching and its compatibility with space-time physics already in 2001 (Butterﬁeld, personal communication).

N. Belnap et al.

transform BST92 structures into structures that are more friendly to local
Euclidicity.
The second property that diﬀerential manifolds in space-time physics
satisfy, but which is typically violated by BST92 structures, is a topological
separation property known as the Hausdorﬀ property (see again Section 3.2).
We will not enforce this feature: the branching structures we develop still
violate the Hausdorﬀ property. We will argue, however, that this violation
is innocuous, as each separate possible history is Hausdorﬀ in its natural
topology. In the same spirit, a manifold representing a single space time of
general relativity is Hausdorﬀ. Since we aim at enabling both the assignment of coordinates to events and the representation of alternative spatiotemporal histories, the combination of local Euclidicity and the violation of
Hausdorﬀness on the whole structure seems to be the best result that one
can aim to achieve.4
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the extant theory of BST92 in formal detail. We comment on topological issues in Section 3.
In Section 4, we introduce the “new foundations” BST theory, BSTNF . In
Section 5 we show how the two frameworks are linked, and we prove general
translatability results both ways. We conclude in Section 6.

2.

What is Out There: The Formal Framework of BST92

Branching space-times theories have been developed in a number of writings
starting with Belnap [1]. The dominant theory that has emerged, BST92 ,
demands that histories branch at choice points, in the following way: any two
histories overlap, and their overlap contains at least one maximal element.
That decision has the problematic topological consequence mentioned above,
which will be avoided by the novel BST theory to be developed in this
paper. There is a substantial common core of the two theories, which we
present in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2 we provide some general facts about
common BST structures. In Section 2.3 we go on to describe the branching
of histories in general terms, and in Section 2.4 we give a formal deﬁnition
of BST92 , including its prior choice postulate that demands the existence of
choice points.
4
Technically, we are after branching structures that give rise to generalized diﬀerential
manifolds, where maximal Hausdorﬀ sub-manifolds can be identiﬁed with possible histories
representing single space-times. In this paper, we are only concerned with the topological
structure, deferring a discussion of the diﬀerential structure to a separate companion paper.

The Core Theory of Branching Space-Times

In this section we describe the formal core of common BST structures (Deﬁnition 2), which is shared by both the established theory of BST92 and by the
“new foundations” theory, BSTNF , that we are motivating and discussing
in this paper.5 Both theories are spelled out in terms of partial orderings,
so we provide some pertinent general notions ﬁrst.
Definition 1. (Partial order, chain, directed set) A pair W, < is a strict
partial ordering iﬀ < is a relation on the set W that is antisymmetric (∀x, y ∈
W [x < y → y  < x]) and transitive (∀x, y, z ∈ W [(x < y ∧ y < z) → x < z]).
Note that < is thereby irreﬂexive (∀x ∈ W [x  < x]). We use the companion
notation  in the standard way, i.e., e  e iﬀ (e < e ∨ e = e ). We
extend the ordering notation to sets, with the universal reading, that is: for
E, F ⊆ W and e ∈ W , we write E  e iﬀ ∀x ∈ E [x  e], we write e  F iﬀ
∀y ∈ F [e  y], and we write E  F iﬀ ∀y ∈ F [E  y].
A set l ⊆ W is a chain iﬀ any two of its members are comparable, i.e.,
for any x, y ∈ l, either x  y or y < x. A set D ⊆ W is (upward) directed
iﬀ it contains a common upper bound for any two of its members, i.e., D is
directed iﬀ for any x, y ∈ D there is z ∈ D s.t. x  z and y  z.
Definition 2. (Common BST structure) A common BST structure is a
pair W, < that fulﬁlls the following conditions:
1. W is a non-empty set of possible point events.
2. < is a strict partial ordering (Deﬁnition 1) denoting precedence on W .
A set h ⊆ W is a history iﬀ h is maximal w.r.t. to the property of being
directed. We write Hist(W ) for the set of all histories in W, < (omitting
“(W )” if the reference is clear), and for E ⊆ W , we write H[E] for the
set of those histories containing the whole of E, i.e.: H[E] =df {h ∈ Hist |
E ⊆ h}. We abbreviate H[{e}] as He , i.e., He =df {h ∈ Hist | e ∈ h}.
3. W contains no maximal elements: ∀x ∈ W ∃y ∈ W [x < y]. Also, W
contains no minima elements: ∀x ∈ W ∃y ∈ W [y < x].
4. The ordering < is dense: ∀x, y ∈ W [x < y → ∃z ∈ W [x < z < y]].
5. The ordering contains inﬁma for all lower bounded chains: If l ⊆ W is
a chain that has a lower bound (for some e ∈ W , e  l), then l has a
unique greatest lower bound inf l, which satisﬁes ∀x [x  l → x  inf l.
5
The common structures of Deﬁnition 2 contain one axiom that was not part of the
original formal deﬁnitions; see note 9 below for details. Published discussions of BST
structures also diﬀer with respect to the permissibility of maximal and/or minimal elements
in these structures. In this paper, for simplicity’s sake, we exclude maxima and minima.

244

N. Belnap et al.

6. The ordering contains history-relative suprema for all upper bounded
chains: If l ⊆ W is a chain with an upper bound (for some e ∈ W , l  e),
and h ∈ Hist is a history for which l ⊆ h, then l has a unique smallest
upper bound suph l in h:
∀x [(x ∈ h ∧ l  x) → sup l  x].
h

7. Weiner’s postulate: Let l, l ⊆ h1 ∩h2 be upper bounded chains in histories
h1 and h2 . Then the order of the suprema in these histories is the same:
sup l  sup l
h1

h1

iﬀ

sup l  sup l .
h2

h2

8. Historical connection: Any two histories intersect non-emptily, i.e., for h1 ,
h2 ∈ Hist, we have h1 ∩ h2  = ∅.
From this list, items 1–6 are motivated by the demand that BST structures
be continuous orderings such as employed in space-time theories. Item 7
arises as a technical requirement ruling out unintended ordering structures.
Item 8, on the other hand, is philosophically motivated by taking indeterminism to be a feature of Our World.
2.2.

Some Facts About Common BST Structures: Histories and Chains

If our world is indeterministic, then not everything that can happen at all,
can happen together—some sets of events are compatible, but others are
not. For example, it is possible that it rains in Pittsburgh next week, and
it is possible that it rains in Kraków next week, and indeed it is possible
that next week, it rains both in Pittsburgh and in Kraków. On the other
hand, it is possible that the coin I am about to toss comes up heads, and
it is possible that it comes up tails, but it is not possible that it comes up
heads and comes up tails. These events are incompatible, or inconsistent.
In BST theory, the notion of compatibility is expressed via the deﬁnition
of a history: histories are maximal sets of compatible events.6 Formally, as
stated in Deﬁnition 2(2), a history is a maximal directed set, i.e., a set h
maximal w.r.t. the property that for any two events x, y ∈ h, there is some
event z ∈ h such that x and y lie in the past of z. A useful motivation for
6

In some related literature, histories are called “chronicles”; see, e.g., Jacobsen et al.
[7]. We stick with the well-established terminology of “history”. It is important not to
confuse a history in the technical sense of BST theory (a maximal consistent set of events)
with the everyday notion of the history of a given event. The latter use is always relational,
whereas the BST use is non-relational.

245

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

this deﬁnition of a history is in terms of the consistency of the past: if there
is some possible event z from the perspective of which both x and y have
already happened, then x and y are consistent.
Here are some useful facts about histories in common BST structures:
Fact 1. (Facts about histories) Let h, h1 , h2 ∈ Hist and let e, e ∈ W . (1)
Histories are closed downward: If e ∈ h and e < e, then e ∈ h. Thus, if
e < e, we have He ⊆ He . (2) The complement of a history is closed upward:
If e  ∈ h and e < e , then e  ∈ h. (3) No history can be a proper subset of
another history: If h1 ⊆ h2 , then h1 = h2 . (4) Any chain is part of some
history. In particular, for any e ∈ W , He  = ∅. (5) As W contains no maximal
elements, no history h contains a maximal element either.
Proof. (1, 2) By maximal directedness. (3) By maximality. (4) Chains are
directed, and thus can be extended using the Zorn-Kuratowski lemma. Note
that singletons are also chains. (5) For reductio, let e be a maximal element
of history h. Then e is the unique maximal element of h. Otherwise there
would be e ∈ h incomparable with e and an upper bound e ∈ h for e and
e , with e < e , so e would not be maximal in h. But then as e is the unique
maximal element of h and there is some e ∈ W for which e < e (as W
contains no maximal elements), the set h ∪ {e } is also directed (e , being
the maximum, is a common upper bound for any two elements). Thus h is
not maximal directed, i.e., not a history, contrary to our assumption.
As history-relative suprema of chains will play a crucial role in this paper,
we provide a number of pertinent deﬁnitions and facts.
Definition 3. (Chains and related sets) We deﬁne the following classes of
chains and related sets:
• Ce : the set of chains ending in, but not containing, e. That is:
l ∈ Ce iﬀ l is an upper bounded chain and there is some h ∈ Hist for
which l ⊆ h and suph l = e, but e  ∈ l.
• S (l): the set of all history-relative suprema for an upper bounded chain
l:
S (l) =df {s ∈ W | ∃h ∈ Hist [l ⊆ h ∧ s = sup l]}.
h

• Pe : the proper past of e:
Pe =df {e ∈ W | e < e}.

We establish the following Facts, using the existence of history-relative
suprema and the Weiner postulate:

246

N. Belnap et al.

Fact 2. Let l ⊆ h, and let s = suph l for some h ∈ Hist with l ⊆ h . If we
have s ∈ h, then suph l = s.
Proof. Assume that s ∈ h. Observe that s ∈ h , and that {s} is a (trivial)
chain with suph∗ {s} = s for any h∗ ∈ Hs . We can use the Weiner postulate
on the chains l and {s}. As suph {s} = s = suph l, we also have to have
suph l = suph {s} = s.
Fact 3. Let l be an upper bounded chain and h1 , h2 ∈ H[l] , and let
sup l = s1  = s2 = sup l.
h1

h2

Then there is no history h ⊇ {s1 , s2 }.
Proof. Assume otherwise, and let h ⊇ {s1 , s2 } for some h ∈ Hist. We have
l ⊆ h, since s1 ∈ h and l  s1 . By Fact 2, we have both suph l = s1 (as
s1 ∈ h) and suph l = s2 (as s2 ∈ h). So, contrary to our assumption, s1 = s2 .
Here is another useful fact about suprema of chains: If you remove the
endpoint of a maximal upper bounded chain, the history-relative supremum
does not change. The same holds for inﬁma.
Fact 4. Suprema and inﬁma of maximal chains are unaﬀected by removing
the supremum or inﬁmum: (1) Let l be a maximal upper bounded chain,
and let h ∈ Hist s.t. l ⊆ h. Let s =df suph l. Then for l =df l \ {s}, we
also have suph l = s. (2) Let l be a maximal lower bounded chain, and let
e =df inf l. Then for l =df l \ {e}, we also have inf l = e.
Proof. (1) If s  ∈ l, we have l = l, and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise,
let s =df suph l . Clearly, l  s, so s  s (by the deﬁnition of suprema).
Now assume for reductio that s  = s , i.e., s < s. By the construction of l ,
we then have (*) ∀x ∈ l [x  = s → x  s ]. By density, there is some e ∈ W
for which s < e < s. By (*), we have e  ∈ l. But then, again by (*), we
have that l∗ =df l ∪ {e} is also a chain with suph l∗ = s, and l∗  l. This
contradicts the maximality of l. So, we have s = s .
The proof for (2) is exactly parallel to that for (1).
The next Fact shows that the proper past of an event e consists of all the
chains ending in, but not containing, e.
Fact 5. For e ∈ W , we have Pe = ∪l∈Ce l.
Proof. “⇐” Let x ∈ ∪l∈Ce l, i.e., x ∈ l for some l ∈ Ce , and let h ∈ He . As
suph l = e and e  ∈ l, we have l < e, and thus, x < e, i.e., x ∈ Pe .

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

247

“⇒” Let x ∈ Pe , i.e., x < e. Then {x, e} is a chain, which by the ZornKuratowski lemma can be extended to a maximal chain l ending in e. Let
h ∈ He ; we have suph l = e. By Fact 4, for l =df l \ {e} we also have
suph l = e, whereby we have some l ∈ Ce for which x ∈ l .
2.3.

Indeterminism as the Branching of Histories

If a common BST structure contains just one history, then it is trivial from
the point of view of indeterminism: all events are compatible, and the picture of a world with just one history is the picture of a deterministic world.
Since there are multiple histories in any non-trivial BST structure, there
are diﬀerent ways in which these histories can interrelate. A strong intuitive
principle is historical connection (Deﬁnition 2(8)): The idea is that any two
histories should share some common past. In this way, any common BST
structure fulﬁlls Lewis’s condition of qualifying as “a world”, since it is connected by a “suitable external relation”, namely, the relation of precedence,
< (see [8], 208).
We will later see that historical connection is implied by stronger principles about the interrelation of histories. These so-called prior choice principles (Deﬁnitions 6 and 18) make speciﬁc demands on the way in which
histories branch oﬀ one from another. The key decision is what the branching of histories looks like locally: what are the objects at which histories
branch? BST92 decides for points: histories branch, or remain undivided,
at points. With a view to the formal deﬁnition of this type of branching
in Section 2.4 below, we ﬁrst provide some essential deﬁnitions. We start
with the notion of undividedness. Let two histories h1 , h2 share some event
e ∈ h1 ∩ h2 . Then they also may or may not share a later event. In the
former case, we call the histories undivided at e:
Definition 4. (Undividedness) Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist, and let e ∈ h1 ∩ h2 . We
say that h1 and h2 are undivided at e (h1 ≡e h2 ) iﬀ there is some e ∈ h1 ∩h2
for which e < e .
For any event e, the relation ≡e among the set He of histories containing e is obviously symmetrical and reﬂexive, by the form of the deﬁnition.
We will discuss the issue of transitivity in more detail later on. Our way of
enforcing historical connection via prior choice principles will ensure transitivity. Given transitivity, ≡e is an equivalence relation on He . We use the
notation Πe to indicate the partition of histories from He into equivalence
classes according to ≡e , i.e.,
for H ⊆ He with H  = ∅, we have H ∈ Πe ↔ ∀h1 , h2 ∈ H [h1 ≡e h2 ].

248

N. Belnap et al.

It may be that in fact all histories from He are undivided at e, i.e., e is not
maximal in the intersection of any two histories from He . In that case, we
have Πe = {He }.
In case two histories h1 , h2 share an event e but no event later than e,
that event e is a maximum in the intersection of the histories h1 ∩ h2 . In
that case, we say that the histories split at e:
Definition 5. (Splitting at a point; choice point) Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist, and let
e ∈ h1 ∩ h2 . We say that h1 and h2 split at e, and that e is a choice point
for histories h1 and h2 (h1 ⊥e h2 ), iﬀ it is not the case that h1 ≡e h2 , i.e.,
iﬀ e is a maximal point in h1 ∩ h2 .
The existence of choice points has important implications for the topological properties of the resulting structures, as we noted above and as we
will discuss further in Section 3. At this point, we thus reach an important
question: do the postulates of a common BST structure decide whether there
are choice points? It turns out that the answer is no: we can show that both
the existence and the non-existence of choice points are live options for the
branching of histories in common BST structures. Consider, thus, the two
common BST structures depicted in Figure 1a, b.7 These structures illustrate the two possibilities for histories to branch in common BST structures,
thus picturing the nuclei of, on the one hand, the well-developed theory of
BST92 (a), and the “new foundations” theory BSTNF (b), which will be
developed in formal detail in Section 4.8
We provide a formal deﬁnition of these structures, so as not rely solely
on pictures. Both structures are deﬁned as quotients of L2 =df R × {1, 2},
the double real line, under the equivalence relations ≡a and ≡b , which are
deﬁned, respectively, as
x, i ≡a x , i  ⇔df (x = x ∧ (i = i ∨ x  0));
x, i ≡b x , i  ⇔df (x = x ∧ (i = i ∨ x < 0)).
These relations diﬀer only in their handling of x = 0. The ordering on the
quotient structures Ma =df L2 / ≡a and Mb =df L2 / ≡a is deﬁned uniformly
via
7
These structures have just the bare minimum of complexity to fulﬁll the axioms of
Deﬁnition 2 in a non-trivial way: they contain just two histories each. Furthermore, they do
not include any spatial extension—so in fact they are so-called branching time structures
as well.
8
The two topological possibilities for branching have been discussed, e.g., by McCall
[12], McCabe [11], and Strobach [22, 208].

Figure 1. Two simple common BST structures a with a choice point and
b without a choice point. Both (a) and (b) depict partial orderings in
which there are two continuous histories branching at point 0. In (a),
point 0 is the shared maximum in the intersection of the histories, i.e.,
a choice point. In (b), the intersection of the histories has no maximum,
and points 01 and 02 are diﬀerent history-relative suprema (minimal
upper bounds) of the intersection

[x, i] < [x , i ] ⇔df (x < x ∧ [x, i] = [x, i ]).
It is easy to check that these structures are non-empty partial orderings
without maxima or minima that satisfy the density and continuity (inﬁma
and suprema) conditions of a common BST structure. The two histories
ha1 , ha2 in Ma and hb1 , hb2 in Mb are, respectively (for γ one of a or b),
hγ1 = {[x, 1] ∈ Mγ | x ∈ R};

hγ2 = {[x, 2] ∈ Mγ | x ∈ R}.

The intersections of these two histories are, respectively, the upper bounded
chains
la =df ha1 ∩ ha2 = {[x, 1] ∈ Ma | x  0};

lb =df hb1 ∩ hb2 = {[x, 1] ∈ Mb | x < 0}.

The diﬀerence is this: while the chain la in Ma has a maximal element,
[0, 1], the chain lb in Mb has no maximal element. That latter chain instead
has two diﬀerent history-relative suprema:
sup lb = [0, i],

i = 1, 2.

Branching via the Prior Choice Principle of BST92

Having exhibited the two options for fulﬁlling the common BST axioms in a
simple case, we could now enter into a philosophical discussion of what is the
right way to go. We refrain from attempting any a priori arguments here.
One can give good reasons for both options. Thus, in favor of the existence
of choice points, one can argue that a causal account of indeterminstic choice

250

requires a special last element of indecision, and thus, a maximal element of
any two branching histories. In favor of the absence of choice points, one can
cite issues of uniformity (it is possible to have branching without maxima
in a uniform way), or topological aspects of the resulting structures. Both
these issues will be discussed in Section 3. In our view, they provide a good
motivation for investigating common BST structures without choice points,
and this is what we will do in Section 4. As a matter of fact, however, BST
theory was developed with the requirement of the existence of choice points,
and the resulting axiomatic theory, BST92 , has proved to be fruitful for quite
a number of applications, e.g., to causation [4], to probability theory [13,25],
and to physics [16,17].
So in what follows, we ﬁrst characterize BST92 , which is the BST theory
with choice points, in full formal detail. This requires the addition of just
a single extra axiom to the basis of common BST structures.9 As originally
described by Belnap [1], the theory posits the axioms of a common BST
structure together with the so-called prior choice principle, which we will
denote PCP92 to indicate its historical origin. Basically, PCP92 requires that
whenever an event e belongs to one history h1 but not to another history
h2 , these two histories split at a choice point c in the past of e:
e ∈ (h1 \ h2 ) → ∃c [c < e ∧ h1 ⊥c h2 ].
It turns out, however, that in order to enforce the transitivity of the relation
of undividedness, PCP92 needs to be formulated not for points, but for lower
bounded chains contained in the diﬀerence of two histories, as follows.10
Definition 6. (BST92 prior choice principle, PCP92 ) A common BST structure W, < fulﬁlls the BST92 prior choice principle iﬀ it fulﬁlls the following
condition: Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist be two histories, and let l ⊆ (h1 \ h2 ) be a lowerbounded chain that is contained fully in history h1 but does not intersect
history h2 . Then there is a choice point c ∈ h1 ∩ h2 s.t. c < l and h1 ⊥c h2 ,
i.e., c lies properly below l and is a choice point for h1 and h2 , which is
maximal in the intersection of h1 and h2 .
That deﬁnition obviously implies the point version described above, as
any singleton {e} is a lower-bounded chain. It also ensures historical connection independently of the explicit requirement of Deﬁnition 2(8): any two
9

Weiner’s postulate (Deﬁnition 2(7)), which was not included in early BST papers
such as Belnap [1], was added later as it was found to be important for developing a useful
probability theory in BST92 ; see Weiner and Belnap [25] and Müller [13].

undividedness.

diﬀerent histories have a non-empty diﬀerence (see Fact 1(3)), so that they
have to share a choice point.
We can now enter PCP92 in its oﬃcial form as an additional item to our
list of axioms for BST92 :
Definition 7. (BST92 structure) A BST92 structure is a common BST
structure W, < (Deﬁnition 2) that also fulﬁlls the BST92 prior choice principle (Deﬁnition 6).
In the next section, we continue our description of BST92 with a focus on
its topological aspects. In particular, we provide some facts related to local
Euclidicity and Hausdorﬀness. As indicated, these are the features that are
essential for relating histories in BST to space-time structures studied in
physics.

Topological Aspects of BST92

In this section we describe the natural topology for common BST structures,
the so-called diamond topology, in Section 3.1. We comment on some of the
topological features of BST92 in Section 3.2. We will return to topological
issues for the case of BSTNF further down, in Section 4.7.
3.1.

General Idea of the Diamond Topology

BST admits a natural topology, introduced by Paul Bartha,11 which we call
the diamond topology. The topology is deﬁned either for W , the base set of
a BST structure, or for a given history h. In the deﬁnitions below, M C(e)
(M Ch (e)) stands for the set of maximal chains in W (in h) that contain e.
Definition 8. (Diamond topology T on W ) Z is an open subset of W ,
Z ∈ T , iﬀ Z = W or for every e ∈ Z and for every t ∈ M C(e) there are
e1 , e2 ∈ t such that e1 < e < e2 and the diamond De1 ,e2 ⊆ Z, where
De1 ,e2 =df {e ∈ W | e1  e  e2 }.
Definition 9. (History-relative diamond topologies Th on W ) For h ∈ Hist,
Z is an open subset of h, Z ∈ Th , iﬀ Z = h or for every e ∈ Z and for every
t ∈ M Ch (e) there are e1 , e2 ∈ t such that e1 < e < e2 and the diamond
De1 ,e2 ⊆ Z.
11

It is straightforward to check that indeed T and Th are topologies, i.e.,
both the empty set and the base set (W or h, respectively) are open, the
intersection of two open sets is open, and the union of countably many
open sets is open. The claim of naturalness is based on the observation
that these topologies, if appropriately restricted, coincide with the standard
open-ball topology on Rn , and that the notion of convergence they induce
coincides with the order-theoretic notions of inﬁma and suprema.12 The
history-relative topologies are the so-called subspace topologies induced by
the diamond topology on W , by taking a history as a subspace of W . This
means that A ∈ Th iﬀ there is A ∈ T such that A = A ∩ h.
In BST92 , the global topology and the history-relative topologies have
diﬀerent features. This fact reﬂects a problem with local Euclidicity, which
we discuss next.
3.2.

Properties of the Diamond Topology for BST92

We review here some facts about diamond topologies in BST92 , which are
proved in Placek et al. [18]. The ﬁrst observation is that, unless W, < is
a one-history structure, a history h is not open in the global topology T ,
whereas it is open by deﬁnition in its own history-relative topology Th .
Generally, if A ∈ Th and A contains a choice point, then A  ∈ T , so there is
a systematic discrepancy between the global and the history-relative notions
of openness. This discrepancy is reﬂected in a diﬀerence with respect to the
Hausdorﬀ property, which is deﬁned as follows:
Definition 10. (Hausdorﬀ property) A topological space X, T (X) is
Hausdorﬀ iﬀ for any distinct x, y ∈ X there are disjoint open environments
of x and of y, i.e., there are Ox , Oy ∈ T (X) for which Ox ∩ Oy = ∅.
Putting aside pathological structures that prohibit the construction of
light-cones,13 it can be proved that the history-relative topologies Th on
a BST92 structure have the Hausdorﬀ property. This fact stands in sharp
contrast with the properties of the global diamond topology T : if a BST92
structure has more than one history, its global topology is non-Hausdorﬀ
(again barring pathological structures). Moreover, non-Hausdorﬀness is related to the existence of upper-bounded chains that have more than one
history-relative supremum. As one might expect, a pair of distinct historyrelative suprema of a chain provides a witness for non-Hausdorﬀness: if any
For a discussion of the naturalness of the diamond topology, see Placek et al. [18, §6].
Such pathological BST92 structures violate one of the conditions C1–C4 of Placek et
al. [18].

253

two open sets in T each contain a distinct supremum, they must overlap
because they share some ﬁnal segment of the chain in question.
In physics it is standardly required that individual space-times be Hausdorﬀ (see, e.g., [24], 12). As individual space-times are represented by single
histories in a BST92 structure, we take the above result as showing that
BST92 structures are not in tension with the Hausdorﬀness requirement of
space-time physics. The non-Hausdorﬀness of the global topology of a BST92
structure simply reﬂects the fact that such a structure brings together more
than one space-time, explicitly representing a number of alternative spatiotemporal developments.
There is, however, another topological feature of BST92 that is highly
problematic, viz., an issue with local Euclidicity,14 which is deﬁned as follows:
Definition 11. (Local Euclidicity) A topological space X, T (X) is locally
Euclidean of dimension n iﬀ for every x ∈ X there is an open neighborhood
Ox ∈ T (X) and a homeomorphism ϕx that maps Ox onto an open set
Rx ∈ T (Rn ).
Local Euclidicity is standardly presupposed (often without explicitly mentioning the condition by name) when the notion of a space-time manifold is
introduced. On such a manifold, local coordinates are deﬁned via so-called
charts (see, e.g., [24], 12f.): at each point of the manifold, it is possible to
ﬁnd a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to some open set of Rn , and the
respective mapping induces the coordinates. If a topological space is not
locally Euclidean, it is not possible to assign coordinates in this way.
Given the frugality of the axioms, BST92 structures come in many varieties. Hence it is not realistic to hope that their global topology will always
be locally Euclidean. One can reasonably require, however, that local Euclidicity should transfer from individual histories to the global structure:
if each history-relative topology Th is locally Euclidean, then the global
topology T should also be locally Euclidean. If we have some collection of
physically reasonable space-times, each with an assignment of coordinates,
then a BST analysis of indeterminism should not destroy the coordinate assignment. Unfortunately, local Euclidicity does not transfer from the historyrelative topologies to the global topology of BST92 . A case in point is the
simple two-history model of Figure 1a. The overlap of the histories ha1 and
ha2 has a maximal element [0, 1] = [0, 2]. According to the deﬁnition of
the history-relative diamond topology, the open sets of Thai (i = 1, 2) are
14

254

either of the form {[x, i] | x ∈ (c, d)}, for some open interval (c, d) ⊆ R, or
they are unions of such sets. As every element of the history hai belongs to a
set {[x, i] | x ∈ (c, d)}, and such a set is trivially homeomorphic to an open
interval of R, Thai is locally Euclidean of dimension 1. On the global topology
T on Ma , however, any open neighborhood of the branching point [0, 1]
must extend somewhat to the trunk and to both the arms, i.e., it must contain subsets {[x, 1] | x ∈ (c, d)} and {[x, 2] | x ∈ (c, d )} with c < 0 and
d, d > 0. A fork of that sort, however, cannot be homeomorphically mapped
onto an open interval of the real line. Thus, the global topology of Ma is
not locally Euclidean, despite the fact that each history-relative topology
is. Note that no such problem arises for the structure Mb of Figure 1b, in
which the intersection of the two histories does not have a maximum.

New Foundations for BST, Via Transition Structures in BST92

Recall that the underlying goal of branching space-times theories is to provide a formal framework for analyzing local indeterminism. We have just
seen that one way to achieve that goal, via BST92 , leads to the failure of
local Euclidicity, meaning that there is no way to continuously assign spatiotemporal coordinates to the elements of non-trivial BST92 structures. Our
priority in constructing a “new foundation” theory is to secure local Euclidicity. On the other hand, a violation of the Hausdorﬀ property as in
BST92 , i.e., conﬁned to the global level of indeterministic structures and
not already arising at the level of single histories, seems unproblematic. The
task we set ourselves is therefore to develop BST theory in such a way that
there are no choice points. The resulting formal theory will then provide
generalized manifolds, not required to be Hausdorﬀ. On such manifolds one
can do calculus and, more generally, develop some space-time physics.
The perhaps surprising fact is that the sought-for framework is readily
available via the transition structure of a BST92 structure. More precisely,
starting with a BST92 structure, we will deﬁne the set of its transitions
and deﬁne an ordering relation on it. The resulting partial order turns out
to satisfy all postulates of a common BST structure. However, instead of
PCP92 , it satisﬁes a diﬀerent prior choice principle, which, crucially, excludes
the existence of maximal elements in the intersection of histories. Quite
generally, histories do not split at points, but rather at more complex objects
that we call choice sets. Given some mild assumptions, the resulting global
structures are provably locally Euclidean.

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

255

In this section we introduce the BST92 notion of a transition (Section 4.1)
and show that the full transition structure of a BST92 structure satisﬁes
all the postulates of a common BST structure (Section 4.2). The resulting
notion of a choice set and the emerging pattern of branching are discussed in
Section 4.3. In Section 4.4 we formulate a new prior choice principle, PCPNF ,
and axiomatize the “new foundations” theory BSTNF . In Section 4.5 we
prove that the postulates of BSTNF are satisﬁed by the transition structure
of a BST92 structure. Some further facts about choice sets are established
in Section 4.6. The crucial topological results for BSTNF are announced and
proved in Section 4.7.
4.1.

Transitions

The notion of a transition is a powerful tool for discussing indeterminism.
Belnap [2] picks up the notion from von Wright [23], adding formal rigor.
Generally, a transition is a pair I, O, written I  O, in which I is appropriately prior to O, and O is, in some appropriate sense, an outcome of I.
Various notions of transitions are discussed in Belnap [4]. For our purposes
we focus on the simplest notion of a transition, a basic transition, which in
BST92 is from a possible point event e to one of the immediate possibilities
open at e, i.e., from e to a member of the partition Πe of the set He of
histories containing e,
τ = e  H,

e ∈ W, H ∈ Πe .

Basic transitions are divided up into those that witness local indeterminism,
and those at which, so to speak, nothing happens. The formal distinction
reﬂects whether or not there are multiple immediate future possibilities open
at e, or just one. Thus, at an indeterministic event e (at a choice point), the
partition Πe has more than one member (histories split at e; there are some
h1 , h2 ∈ He for which h1 ⊥e h2 ), whereas at a deterministic event e, there
is only one immediate possibility for the future, whence for all h1 , h2 ∈ He ,
we have h1 ≡e h2 , and Πe = {He }.
Definition 12. (Deterministic and indeterministic basic transitions) A basic transition is a pair e, H, written e  H, with e ∈ W and H ∈ Πe .
For h ∈ He , we write Πe h for the member of Πe that contains h, so that
the basic transition e  Πe h is from e to that (unique) basic outcome of
e that contains h. A basic transition is indeterministic iﬀ Πe has more than
one member. On the other hand, if Πe = {He }, then the transition e  He
is called deterministic or trivial.

256

N. Belnap et al.

We denote the set of basic indeterministic transitions of a BST92 structure
W, < by TR(W ), and the set of all basic transitions by TRfull (W ).
The set of basic transitions, whether deterministic or indeterministic,
admits of a natural partial ordering.
Definition 13. (Transition ordering) For τ1 = e1  H1 , τ2 = e2  H2 ,
we say that τ1 precedes τ2 , written τ1 ≺ τ2 , iﬀ (e1 < e2 and H2 ⊆ H1 ).
The companion non-strict partial ordering is deﬁned via τ1  τ2 ⇔df (τ1 ≺
τ2 ∨ τ1 = τ2 ).
4.2.

Characterizing the Transition Structure of a BST92 Structure

We are often interested only in indeterministic transitions, as deterministic
transitions make no diﬀerence to the branching of histories.15 In the present
context, however, it is important to consider all transitions, including the
ones that are trivial from the point of view of indeterminism. In a BST92
model, we therefore deﬁne the full transition structure as follows:
Definition 14. (The full transition structure of a BST92 structure.) Let
W, < be a BST92 structure. Then we deﬁne the full transition structure
(including trivial transitions), Υ(W, <), using the transition ordering ≺
from Deﬁnition 13, as follows:
Υ(W, <) =df W  , ≺, where

W  =df {e  H | e ∈ W, H ∈ Πe }.

From here on we will denote elements resulting from a transformation with
primes.
Having deﬁned the transition structure, we now characterize its properties. It turns out that the full transition structure Υ(W, <) looks very
much like the original BST92 structure W, <, except for what happens at
the choice points. In fact, we will be able to show that apart from the prior
choice postulate, all deﬁning properties of BST92 , i.e., the whole list of properties of a common BST structure from Deﬁnition 2, continue to hold; see
Theorem 1 below. But by failing the PCP92 , a transition structure is not
a BST92 structure. With respect to the choice points, the diﬀerence is the
following. In BST92 , the branching of histories is from a choice point, shared
among the histories that branch, to the immediate possibilities for the future at that choice point. There are no ﬁrst points in these diﬀerent possible
futures, and this fact leads to the failure of local Euclidicity in the global
BST92 topology (see Section 3.2). In Υ(W, <), on the other hand, each
choice point is replaced by all the transitions that have that choice point as
15

257

an initial. Therefore, where in BST92 there was a last point that was shared
between the diﬀerent possibilities, in the transition structure there are now
multiple ﬁrst points characterizing these diﬀerent possibilities, and there is
no last shared point any more.16 In the structures of Figure 1, the move
from (a) to (b) exactly corresponds to the move from the BST92 structure
Ma to its transition structure Mb .17 For the topological consequences, see
Section 3.2 above and Section 4.7 below.
We now show that the common BST properties of Deﬁnition 2 still hold
for the Υ transform of a BST92 structure. As a ﬁrst easy fact, we note that
Υ(W, <) is a non-empty partial ordering:
Fact 6. Let W, < be a BST92 structure. Then W  , ≺ =df Υ(W, <)
is (1) non-empty and (2) a strict partial ordering (3) without maxima or
minima.
Proof. (1) Since W is non-empty, there is some e ∈ W , hence He  = ∅
by Fact 1(4). So there is a non-empty H ∈ Πe , and hence there exists a
transition e  H ∈ W  .
(2) Since < is irreﬂexive and asymmetric, ≺ is irreﬂexive and asymmetric
as well. For transitivity, let (e1  H1 ) ≺ (e2  H2 ) and (e2  H2 ) ≺
(e3  H3 ). By transitivity of < we have e1 < e3 . Also, from H2 ⊆ H1 and
H3 ⊆ H2 we have H3 ⊆ H1 by transitivity of ⊆. Together this establishes
(e1  H1 ) ≺ (e3  H3 ).
(3) For no maxima, let τ = e  H ∈ W  , and let h ∈ H ⊆ He . As
W contains no maxima (Deﬁnition 2(3)), h contains no maxima either
(Fact 1(5)), so there is e1 ∈ h for which e < e1 . Accordingly we have
τ  =df e1  Πe1 h ∈ W  . It is easy to check that τ ≺ τ  , which establishes
that τ is not maximal in W  .
For no minima, similarly, let τ = e  H ∈ W  . As W contains no
minima, there is e1 ∈ W for which e1 < e. Let h ∈ He . By downward
closure, e1 ∈ h, i.e., h ∈ He1 . So there is τ  =df e1  Πe1 h ∈ W  , and
τ  ≺ τ . Thus, τ is not minimal in W  .
The following facts about alternatives to the deﬁnition of the transition
ordering (Deﬁnition 13) will be helpful later on.
Fact 7. Let τ1 = e1  H1 , τ2 = e2  H2 be transitions in a BST92
structure W, <. (1) Generally, τ1 ≺ τ2 iﬀ (e1 < e2 and He2 ⊆ H1 ) iﬀ

(e1 < e2 and there is some h ∈ He2 for which H1 = Πe1 h). (2) If τ1 is
deterministic, then τ1 ≺ τ2 iﬀ e1 < e2 . (3) For the non-strict companion
order, we have τ1  τ2 iﬀ (e1  e2 and H2 ⊆ H1 ).
Proof. (1) We prove the ﬁrst “iﬀ”, from which the second follows immediately. Let e1 < e2 . We have to show that H2 ⊆ H1 iﬀ He2 ⊆ H1 . As
H2 ⊆ He2 , the “⇐” direction is trivial. For “⇒”, assume H2 ⊆ H1 , and let
h ∈ H2 and h ∈ He2 . We have e2 ∈ h ∩ h , which establishes h ≡e1 h . Since
h ∈ H1 ∈ Πe1 , we have H1 = Πe1 h, and by h ≡e1 h , h ∈ H1 as well. So
indeed, He2 ⊆ H1 .
(2) The “⇒” direction is trivial. For “⇐”, let e1 < e2 , and assume that
τ1 is deterministic, so that H1 = He1 . We have to show that H2 ⊆ H1 .
By downward closure of histories (Fact 1(1)), we have He2 ⊆ He1 , and
H2 ⊆ He2 by deﬁnition, so that H2 ⊆ He2 ⊆ He1 = H1 . The claim follows
by transitivity of ⊆.
(3) “⇒”: Assume τ1  τ2 , i.e., either τ1 ≺ τ2 or τ1 = τ2 . In the ﬁrst case,
the claim follows from the deﬁnition of ≺, in the second case the claim is
obvious as then, e1 = e2 and H1 = H2 .
“⇐”: Let H2 ⊆ H1 , and let e1  e2 . Again there are two cases. If e1 = e2 ,
then as H1 , H2 ∈ Πe1 and Πe1 is a partition, H2 ⊆ H1 implies H2 = H1 ,
whence τ1 = τ2 , establishing the claim. The remaining case, e1 < e2 and
H2 ⊆ H1 , satisﬁes the deﬁnition of ≺ exactly as in Deﬁnition 13.
In order to prove that Υ(W, <) is a common BST structure, we need
to establish the form that histories, i.e., maximal directed sets, have in that
ordering. Their form is quite intuitive, even though it turns out that the
proof of that fact is somewhat lengthy. We ﬁrst establish a useful general
fact about directed sets of transitions:
Fact 8. Let T ⊆ Υ(W, <) be a set of transitions, and let there be e ∈ W
and H1 , H2 ∈ Πe , H1  = H2 , s.t. both τ1 =df e  H1 and τ2 =df e  H2
are members of T . Then T is not directed.
Proof. Assume otherwise, i.e., assume that there is some τ ∗ = e∗  H ∗ ∈
T for which τ1  τ ∗ and τ2  τ ∗ . By Fact 7(1), this implies He∗ ⊆ H1 and
He∗ ⊆ H2 . But as H1 and H2 are diﬀerent elements of the partition Πe , we
have H1 ∩ H2 = ∅, contradicting He∗ ⊆ H1 ∩ H2 . (Note that He∗  = ∅ by
Fact 1(4).)
Now we can tackle the form of histories in Υ(W, <).
Lemma 1. Let W, < be a BST92 structure, and let W  , ≺ =df Υ(W, <).
The histories (maximal directed sets) in W  , ≺ are exactly the sets
Th =df {e  Πe h | e ∈ h}

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

259

for h in Hist(W ).
Proof. First we establish that such sets are indeed histories in W  , ≺.
Thus, take some h ∈ Hist(W ), and let Th =df {e  Πe h | e ∈ h} ⊆ W  .
The set Th is directed: take e1  Πe1 h and e2  Πe2 h from Th , whence
e1 , e2 ∈ h. As h is directed, there is e3 ∈ h such that e1 , e2  e3 . By
construction, e3  Πe3 h ∈ Th . And as to the ordering, He3 ⊆ Πe1 h
because e3 ∈ h and e1  e3 . Analogously, He3 ⊆ Πe2 h. So indeed (noting
Fact 7(1)), ei  Πei h  e3  Πe3 h (i = 1, 2), establishing the common
upper bound. Moreover, Th is maximal directed. To prove this, take some
τ ∗ ∈ (W  \ Th ); this transition has the form τ ∗ = e∗  H ∗ for some e∗ ∈ W ,
H ∗ ∈ Πe∗ . There are two cases.
Case 1: There is some τ = e  Πe h ∈ Th for which e = e∗ , i.e., e∗ ∈ h.
Then, as τ  = τ ∗ , by Fact 8, Th ∪ {τ ∗ } cannot be directed.
Case 2: There is no τ = e  Πe h ∈ Th for which e = e∗ , i.e., e∗  ∈ h.
Then we have e∗ ∈ h for a diﬀerent h ∈ Hist(W ), and by the BST92 prior
choice principle, there is some c ∈ h ∩ h such that c < e∗ and h ⊥c h . As
c ∈ h, we have τc =df c  Πc h ∈ Th . We can now show that Th ∪ {τ ∗ }
is not directed: there can be no common upper bound for τc and τ ∗ in W  .
Assume for reductio that there is some τ  = e  H  ∈ Th ∪ {τ ∗ } for which
τc  τ  and τ ∗  τ  . We can rule out τ  = τ ∗ : we have τc  = τ ∗ by c < e∗ ,
and τc  ≺ τ ∗ as He∗  ⊆ Πc h (as He∗ ⊆ Πc h ). So we must have τ  ∈ Th .
By the deﬁnition of ≺, the assumed ordering relations imply He ⊆ Πc h
and He ⊆ H ∗ ⊆ Πc h . But we have Πc h ∩ Πc h  = ∅, contradicting
Fact 1(4).
So, having shown that the sets Th are indeed histories in W  , ≺, we
need to show that all histories in W  , ≺ are of that form. Thus, let g ⊆ W 
be a history in W  , ≺, maximal directed w.r.t. ≺. By Fact 8, there is no
e ∈ W for which g contains two transitions e  H1 and e  H2 , H1  = H2 ,
so that we can write
g = {e  H(e) | e ∈ E}
for some set E ⊆ W , where H(e) ∈ Πe . We ﬁrst show that E is directed:
Take e1 , e2 ∈ E, so that τi =df ei  H(ei ) ∈ g. By directedness of g, there
is some τ3 = e3  H(e3 ) ∈ g for which τi  τ3 (i = 1, 2), which implies
e3 ∈ E, e1  e3 , and e2  e3 . This proves that E is directed, and therefore
there is some history h ∈ Hist(W ) for which E ⊆ h. We now show that for
all e ∈ E, we have h ∈ H(e). Thus, take some e ∈ E, which is the initial of
some τ = e  H(e) ∈ g. By Fact 6(3) and Fact 1(5), τ cannot be maximal
in g, i.e., there is some τ  = e  H(e ) ∈ g for which τ ≺ τ  . This implies

260

N. Belnap et al.

that He ⊆ H(e), and as e ∈ E ⊆ h, we have h ∈ He and therefore also
h ∈ H(e).
As h ∈ H(e) for all e ∈ E, we have H(e) = Πe h for all e ∈ E. This
implies g ⊆ Th , and by Fact 1(3), we have established g = Th .
Given these facts, we can now prove that switching from a BST92 structure to its full transition structure preserves the common BST structure
axioms.
Theorem 1. Let W, < be a BST92 structure. Its full transition structure
Υ(W, <) is still a common BST structure according to Deﬁnition 2.
Proof. We need to check that W  , ≺ =df Υ(W, <) satisﬁes all the properties (1)–(8) listed in Deﬁnition 2.
1. W  is non-empty. See Fact 6(1).
2. W  ≺ is a strict partial ordering. See Fact 6(2).
3. W  contains neither maximal nor minimal elements. See Fact 6(3).
4. ≺ is dense.
Let (e1  H1 ) ≺ (e3  H3 ), which means that e1 < e3 and H3 ⊆ H1 .
By density of <, there is e2 ∈ W for which e1 < e2 < e3 . Take some
h ∈ H3 , so that {e1 , e2 , e3 } ⊆ h. Let H2 =df Πe2 h. We claim that the
transition e2  H2 is ≺-sliced between the two transitions above. We
have to show that H2 ⊆ H1 and H3 ⊆ H2 . For the former, take some
h2 ∈ H2 ; we have h2 ≡e1 h as witnessed by e2 . As H1 ∈ Πe1 , therefore,
h2 ∈ H1 iﬀ h ∈ H1 . Now as h ∈ H3 and H3 ⊆ H1 , we have h ∈ H1 , so
that indeed, H2 ⊆ H1 . The latter claim is established analogously.
5. Any lower bounded chain in W  , ≺ has an inﬁmum in ≺.
Let l = {ei  Hi | i ∈ K} (K some index set) be a chain that is lower
bounded by e∗  H ∗ . Then the set l =df {ei | i ∈ K} of initials of l is a
chain lower bounded by e∗ , and there is a history h ⊆ W for which l ⊆ h.
By the BST92 postulate of inﬁma, l has an inﬁmum v in <. The inﬁmum
v gives rise to the transition v  =df v  Πv h ∈ W  . Let ei  Hi ∈ l .
We have v  ei (as ei ∈ l), and Hi ⊆ Πv h because ei ∈ h and v  ei .
Thus, v   (ei  Hi ), so v  is a lower bound of l . Let now e  H be
any lower bound of l , whence e is a lower bound of l. As v is the inﬁmum
of l, we have e  v, and as l ⊆ h, we have H = Πe h, which implies
Hv ⊆ H. Thus e  H  v  , i.e., v  is indeed the greatest lower bound of
l .
6. Any upper-bounded chain in W  , ≺ has a history-relative supremum in
each history to which it belongs.

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

261

Let the chain l be upper bounded by u in W  , ≺ and l ∪ {u } ⊆ h
for h ∈ Hist(W  , ≺). Given the form of histories in Hist(W  , ≺) (see
Lemma 1), h = {e  Πe h | e ∈ h} for some h ∈ Hist(W ). It follows
that for the set l of initials of l and for u the initial of u , l ∪ {u} ⊆ h;
additionally, l  u. By the BST92 axiom of history-relative suprema,
there is a history-relative supremum s = suph l of l in h. Consider now the
transition s = s  Πs h ∈ h . That transition is an upper bound of l :
for any e  H ∈ l , we have e  s and Hs ⊆ H = Πe h. Furthermore, s
is the least upper bound (i.e., the supremum) of l in h : let s∗ ∈ h be an
upper bound of l in h ; by the form of histories, s∗ = s∗  Πs∗ hwith
s∗ ∈ h. Thus, s  s∗ (as s is the h-relative supremum of l), and as
s , s∗ ∈ h , by Fact 7(1), we have s  s∗ .
Summing up, we have established that for l ⊆ h an upper-bounded chain
in a W  -history h = {e  Πe h | e ∈ h} (where h is the corresponding
W -history), the initials satisfy l ⊆ h, and there exists the h -relative
supremum
sup l = s  Πs h,
h

where s = suph l.
7. W  , ≺ satisﬁes the Weiner postulate.
We will employ the claim established at the end of the previous item (6),
and the fact that W, < satisﬁes the Weiner postulate.
Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W  ), and let hi = {e  Πe hi  | e ∈ hi } for hi ∈
Hist(W ) (i = 1, 2). We consider two chains l , k  ⊆ h1 ∩h2 , their respective
chains of initials l, k ⊆ h1 ∩ h2 , and their history-relative suprema si =
si  Πsi hi  = suphi (l ) and ci = ci  Πci hi  = suphi (k  ), where
si = suphi l and ci = suphi k, for i = 1, 2. Suppose that s1  c1 , i.e.,
s1  c1 and Πc1 h1  ⊆ Πs1 h1  (see Fact 7(3)). By the Weiner Postulate
of BST92 applied to the chains l and k, from s1  c1 we may infer s2  c2 .
Note that s2 ∈ h2 . Hence Πc2 h2  ⊆ Πs2 h2 . In terms of the transition
ordering, this means that s2  c2 .
8. Historical connection.
Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W  ) be histories, which by Lemma 1 correspond to
h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W ). By historical connection for W , there is some e ∈
h1 ∩ h2 , and by no minima, there is some e∗ ∈ W for which e∗ < e. It
follows that e∗ ∈ h1 ∩ h2 . Let τ =df e∗  Πe∗ h1 . By Lemma 1, we have
τ ∈ h1 . Now e > e∗ is a witness for h1 ≡e∗ h2 , so that Πe∗ h1  = Πe∗ h2 ,
i.e., τ ∈ h2 as well.

Characterizing the Branching of Histories in Transition Structures

We can now discuss formally what has become of the BST92 choice points,
and in which sense a prior choice principle still holds in a full transition
structure.
It turns out that when characterizing transition structures, the role of a
choice point e in BST92 is played here by the notion of a choice set ë, which
describes the local point-wise alternatives for e. In introducing choice sets,
we build on some notions introduced above in Section 2.2. We work with
a common BST structure W  , ≺ derived from a BST92 structure W, <,
i.e., W  , ≺ =df Υ(W, <). Generic elements of W  are written e, etc., and
histories h, etc. The notions of a chain and of a directed set in this section
are relative to the transition ordering ≺.
Definition 15. (Choice set) For e ∈ W  , we deﬁne the choice set based on
e, written ë, to be the intersection of the sets of suprema of all chains ending
in e.18

ë =df
S (l).
l∈Ce

We also call the choice set ë the set of local point-wise alternatives for e.
Note that e then counts as an alternative to itself. The related notions of
alternative histories and history-wise alternatives are deﬁned via the pointwise alternatives:
Definition 16. (Alternative histories and local history-wise alternatives)
We deﬁne the set of alternative histories at ë, Hë , and the set of local historywise alternatives for e, Πë , to be
Hë = {h ∈ Hist | h ∩ ë  = ∅};

Πë =df {Hs | s ∈ ë}.

In order to spell out the variant of the prior choice principle that is
appropriate for transition structures, we deﬁne two new relations between
histories, splitting at a choice set and being undivided at a choice set, written
h1 ⊥ë h2 and h1 ≡ë h2 , resp., in analogy to the respective BST92 notions.
In what follows, we will often use two consequences of Fact 3:
Note that Ce = ∅, as W  contains no minima.—Our notation with the double dot
over e is meant to be suggestive of a number of diﬀerent history-relative suprema on top of
a chain. Think of Figure 1b rotated counterclockwise by 90◦ . Graphically, the analogy with
choice partitions for agents, as deﬁned in Belnap et al. [5, Chapter 7C.2], is suggestive.
Note, however, that these partitions pertain to branching time, not BST, and that they
allow for a coarse-graining of the natural partition of undividedness.

Fact 9. (1) For any h ∈ Hist(W  ) and for any e ∈ W  , we either have
h ∩ ë = ∅, or h ∩ ë = {e } for some e ∈ ë, i.e., a choice set has at most
one element in common with any history. (2) The set of sets of histories Πë
partitions Hë .
Proof. (1) By Fact 3, no history contains more than one history-relative
supremum of any upper bounded chain.
(2) Exhaustiveness is immediate: by deﬁnition, ∪Πë = Hë . To prove
disjointness of the elements of Πë , let H1 , H2 ∈ Πë such that H1  = H2 .
Then H1 = Hs1 and H2 = Hs2 for two distinct members s1 , s2 ∈ ë. Let
h ∈ H1 ; by (1), we then have h  ∈ H2 .
Definition 17. Let h1 , h2 be histories in Hist(W  ), and let e ∈ W  . We
require as a presupposition for h1 ≡ë h2 and h1 ⊥ë h2 that h1 , h2 ∈ Hë , i.e.,
h1 ∩ ë  = ∅ and h2 ∩ ë  = ∅. Then the relations are deﬁned as follows:
h1 ≡ë h2

⇔df

h1 ∩ ë = h2 ∩ ë;

h1 ⊥ë h2

⇔df

h1 ∩ ë  = h2 ∩ ë.

If h1 ⊥ë h2 , we say that the choice set ë is a choice set for histories h1
and h2 . We can establish the following fact about the interrelation of the
relations ⊥ë and ≡ë :
Fact 10. Let e ∈ W and let h1 , h2 ∈ Hë . Then ≡ë and ⊥ë are mutually
exclusive and jointly exhaustive: we have h1 ≡ë h2 iﬀ not h1 ⊥ë h2 .
Proof. Given the assumptions, we have h1 ∩ ë = {s1 } and h2 ∩ ë = {s2 } for
some s1 , s2 ∈ ë. Now by our deﬁnitions, h1 ≡ë h2 iﬀ s1 = s2 , and h1 ⊥ë h2
iﬀ s1  = s2 . These are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive alternatives.
Fact 11. (1) The relation ≡ë is an equivalence relation on the set of alternative histories at ë, Hë . (2) We have Πë = Hë / ≡ë .
Proof. (1) Let h1 , h2 , h3 ∈ Hë . By Fact 9(1), we have hi ∩ ë = {si } (i =
1, 2, 3) for some s1 , s2 , s3 ∈ ë. We have to establish reﬂexivity, symmetry and
transitivity. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are trivial. For transitivity, assume
h1 ≡ë h2 and h2 ≡ë h3 , which holds iﬀ s1 = s2 and s2 = s3 . By transitivity
of identity, s1 = s3 , which implies h1 ≡ë h3 . So Hë / ≡ë is a partition of Hë .
To see that this is the same partition as Πë characterized in Fact 9(2), note
that Hs1 = Hs2 iﬀ s1 = s2 .

Introducing new Foundations: BSTNF

With the required notions at hand, we can now propose a new prior choice
principle, PCPNF . That principle is crucial for our new foundations: will later
show that PCPNF holds in BST92 transition structures, which themselves
are not BST92 structures (see Lemma 2 below):
Definition 18. (PCPNF ) Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W ), and let l be a lower
bounded chain for which l ⊆ h1 but l ∩ h2 = ∅. Then there is some e ∈ W
for which e  l and for which the set ë of local alternatives to e satisﬁes
h1 ⊥ë h2 .
Note the weak relation e  l in the formulation of PCPNF , in contradistinction to the strict relation in the formulation of the BST92 PCP in Deﬁnition 6. For example, if l has just one element c such that c ∈ h1 \ h2 and
c is an element of a non-trivial choice set c̈  = {c}, then the choice set for c
is just c̈ itself, and h1 ⊥c̈ h2 . In such a case we only have the weak ordering
relation, c  l.
Having proposed a new prior choice principle, we can now give a full
deﬁnition of “new foundations” BST, BSTNF :
Definition 19. (BSTNF structure) A partial ordering W,  is a structure
of BSTNF iﬀ it is a common BST structure (Deﬁnition 2) for which the
PCPNF (Deﬁnition 18) holds.
BSTNF structures, being common BST structures, satisfy historical connection just as BST92 structures do. The new PCPNF , however, implies
that the branching of histories in BSTNF is diﬀerent from the branching in
terms of choice points in BST92 : there can be no maximal elements in the
intersection of histories in a BSTNF structure.
Fact 12. Let h1 , h2 be two histories in a BSTNF structure W, <, h1  = h2 .
Then h1 ∩ h2 , which is non-empty, contains no maximal elements. Accordingly, for any e ∈ W , if e ∈ h1 ∩ h2 , then h1 ≡e h2 , where ≡e is the BST92
notion of undividedness.
Proof. By historical connection, h1 ∩ h2  = ∅. Assume for reductio that
there is an e ∈ h1 ∩ h2 that is maximal in h1 ∩ h2 , i.e., for all e ∈ W , if
e < e , then e  ∈ h1 ∩h2 . By the Zorn-Kuratowski lemma, there is a maximal
lower bounded chain J ⊆ {x ∈ h1 | e  x} in the h1 -future of e. As e ∈ J,
we have inf J = e, and by no maxima, J  =df J \ {e}  = ∅. By Fact 4, e is
also the inﬁmum of J  . As we have J  ⊆ h1 \ h2 , by PCPNF there is c̈ with
some c1 , c2 ∈ c̈ such that c1 ∈ h1 , c2 ∈ h2 , h1 ∩ c̈ = {c1 }  = {c2 } = h2 ∩ c̈,

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

265

and c1  J  . Then c1 and c2 cannot share a history (by Fact 9(1)). However,
since e = inf J  , by the deﬁnition of iniﬁma, c1  e, and as histories are
downward closed, c1 ∈ h2 . But we have c2 ∈ h2 as well, which contradicts
Fact 9(1).
4.5.

BST92 Transition Structures are BSTNF Structures

We can now show that the full transition structure of a BST92 structure is
indeed a BSTNF structure. The only thing that is still missing is to show that
the new prior choice principle is satisﬁed. To this end we need an auxiliary
fact that shows how BST92 choice points give rise to BSTNF choice sets: in
the transition structure, a BST92 choice point c is replaced by all the basic
transitions with initial c, such that these transitions together form a choice
set in the resulting structure.
Fact 13. Let W, < be a BST92 structure, and let h1 ⊥c h2 for h1 , h2 ∈
Hist(W ). Then c1 =df c  Πc h1  and c2 =df c  Πc h2  belong to
Υ(W, <) and are elements of a choice set c̈ for which h1 ⊥c̈ h2 , where
hi = {e  Πe hi  | e ∈ hi } (i = 1, 2) are the histories in Υ(W, <)
corresponding to h1 and h2 .
Proof. Let W  , <  =df Υ(W, <), let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W ), and let c ∈
h1 ∩h2 be s.t. h1 ⊥c h2 . By Lemma 1, hi = {e  Πe hi  | e ∈ hi } ∈ Hist(W  )
(i = 1, 2). Let ci =df c  Πc hi , so that ci ∈ hi (i = 1, 2). In order to show
that c1 , c2 are elements of a choice set c̈ that fulﬁlls h1 ⊥c̈ h2 , we need to
show that every chain l ∈ Cc1 , for which suph1 l = c1 , has c2 as another
history-relative supremum, and vice versa. Since W (and thereby W  ) has
no minimal elements, Cc1  = ∅. Pick an arbitrary chain l ∈ Cc1 , and note
that it has the form l = {e  Πe h1  | e ∈ l} for some chain l ⊆ h1 ,
with c = suph1 l. Since h1 ⊥c h2 , l ⊆ h2 as well, and as l < c, we have
that for every e ∈ l, Πe h1  = Πe h2 . Hence l ⊆ h1 ∩ h2 . It follows that
suph1 l = c1 and suph2 l = c2 (note that the ci ∈ hi are upper bounds of l
and that their initial, c, is the h1 - as well as the h2 -relative supremum of l).
Since l is an arbitrary chain in Cc1 , we showed that every chain in Cc1 has
at least two history-relative suprema, c1 and c2 , i.e., there is a choice set c̈
s.t {c1 , c2 } ⊆ c̈ . Since h1 ∩ c̈ = c1  = c2 = h2 ∩ c̈ , we have h1 ⊥c̈ h2 .
Given this auxiliary fact, we can establish our lemma:
Lemma 2. Let W, < be a BST92 structure. Then that structure’s full transition structure W  , <  =df Υ(W, <) fulﬁlls the new prior choice principle
according to Deﬁnition 18.

266

N. Belnap et al.

Proof. Let l be a chain in W  , <  that is lower bounded by u , and let
h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W  ) be such that (†) l ⊆ h1 but (‡) l ∩ h2 = ∅. By Lemma 1,
hi = {e  Πe hi  | e ∈ hi } for some hi ∈ Hist(W ), i = 1, 2. By (†) we have
that l = {e  Πe h1  | e ∈ l} for a chain l ⊆ h1 that is lower bounded by u,
where u is the initial of u . By (‡), for every e  Πe h1  ∈ l , either e  ∈ h2 ,
or (e ∈ h2 but Πe h1   = Πe h2 ). There are now three cases, depending on
the form of l : (i) l has a minimal element v  = v  Πv h1 , v ∈ h1 ∩ h2 ,
and Πv h1  = Πv h2 , or (ii) l has a minimal element v  = v  Πv h1 ,
v ∈ h1 ∩ h2 , but Πv h1   = Πv h2 , or (iii) l either has no minimal element
at all, or for the minimal element v  = v  Πv h1  of l , v ∈ h1 \ h2 . Case (i)
is impossible as it contradicts (‡). Consider then case (ii): since h1 ⊥v h2 ,
by Fact 13 the two transitions, v1 = v  Πv h1  and v2 = v  Πv h2 
are distinct elements of a choice set v̈  at which histories h1 and h2 split,
h1 ⊥v̈ h2 . Furthermore, as v1 is the minimal element of l , v1  l , as
required by PCPNF . Finally, in case (iii), no element e ∈ l can belong to
h2 : if l has a minimum v  = v  Πv h1  with v ∈ h1 \ h2 , no point above
v can belong to h2 (Fact 1(2)), and in case l has no minimum at all, the
assumption that e ∈ l ∩ h2 implies that there is also some other e1 ∈ l ∩ h
with e1 < e, and hence e1  Πe1 h2  ∈ l ∩ h2 , contradicting (‡). Thus,
l ∩ h2 = ∅. Applying the PCP of BST92 to the chain l ⊆ h1 \ h2 that is lower
bounded by u, we get v ∈ W such that v < l and h1 ⊥v h2 . Exactly like
in case (ii) we thus invoke Fact 13 to produce the sought-for choice set v̈ 
containing v  Πv h1  and v  Πv h2 , for which h1 ⊥v̈ h2 . Since v < l
and given the form of l , we have v  Πv h1   l as well.
Given this result, we have shown that the full transition structure of a
BST92 structure is a BSTNF structure:
Theorem 2. Let W, < be a BST92 structure. Then that structure’s full
transition structure Υ(W, <) is a BSTNF structure.
Proof. From Theorem 1 and Lemma 2.
4.6.

Facts About Choice Sets

In this section we prove a few facts related to sets of local point-wise alternatives and sets of local history-wise alternatives, which will also justify our
terminology. Our main result is Theorem 3, which states that choice sets
fully capture the notion of a local alternative in BSTNF .
Fact 14. Let there be h1 , h2 and e ∈ W such that h1 ⊥ë h2 . Then there is
no c < e for which h1 ⊥c̈ h2 .

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

267

Proof. Assume for reductio that h1 ⊥c̈ h2 for some c1 < e, where c1 ∈
h1 ∩ c̈. Then there are c1 , c2 ∈ c̈ for which c̈ ∩ h1 = c1  = c2 = c̈ ∩ h2 . By
c1 < e there is some l ∈ Ce with c1 ∈ l. By h1 ⊥ë h2 , we have l ⊆ h1 ∩ h2 .
But this implies c1 ∈ h2 , so that {c1 , c2 } ⊆ h2 , contradicting Fact 9(1).
Lemma 3. Let s ∈ ë for some e ∈ W . Then we have x < s iﬀ x < e, i.e.,
Pe = Ps .
Proof. If e = s, there is nothing to prove. Thus, assume e  = s.
“⇐”: Let s ∈ ë, and let x < e. By the Zorn-Kuratowski lemma, there
is some chain l ∈ Ce for which x ∈ l. As s ∈ ë, we know that there is
some h ∈ Hist for which suph l = s. We cannot have s ∈ l: otherwise, for
h witnessing suph l = e, we would have {e, s} ⊆ h , contradicting Fact 3.
Thus, l < s, which implies x < s.
“⇒”: Let s ∈ ë, and let x < s. Assume for reductio that x  < e. We ﬁrst
show that under this assumption, x and e cannot share a history. Assume
otherwise, and let h1 ∈ He ∩ Hx . Let h2 ∈ Hs . Take some l ∈ Ce . We have
x ∈ h1 , x ∈ h2 (by downward closure of histories, as x < s), and l ⊆ h1 (as
e ∈ h1 ). Now, as s ∈ h2 and s ∈ ë, we have l < s, so by downward closure
of histories, l ⊆ h2 as well. Noting that suph2 {x} = x < s = suph2 l, the
Weiner postulate implies that suph1 {x} = x < e = suph1 l, contradicting
the assumption that x  < e.
Under our reductio assumption, x and e do not share a history. Choose
some h1 ∈ He and some h2 ∈ Hs . Since s ∈ ë and e  = s, clearly h1 ⊥ë h2 .
Moreover, by downward closure of histories we have x ∈ h2 , and as e ∈ h1
and x and e do not share a history, x  ∈ h1 . By PCPNF applied to x ∈ h2 \h1 ,
there is c ∈ W such that h1 ⊥c̈ h2 and c  x, and hence c < s and
c ∈ h2 . And there is c ∈ c̈ such that c ∈ h1 . Picking I ∈ Ce and J ∈ Cc ,
I, J ⊆ h1 ∩h2 and observing c = suph2 J < suph2 I = s, the Weiner Postulate
implies c = suph1 J < suph1 I = e. But by Fact 14 then h1 and h2 cannot
split at c̈, if they split at ë, where c < e. So, on our reductio assumption
x  < e, we have derived a contradiction, which proves that x < e.
Given Lemma 3 it is also not diﬃcult to see that for s ∈ ë, a chain ends
in e iﬀ it ends in s:
Fact 15. Let s ∈ ë. Then we have l ∈ Cs iﬀ l ∈ Ce .
Proof. If e = s, there is nothing to prove. Thus, assume e  = s.
“⇐”: Given s ∈ ë and l ∈ Ce , by the deﬁnition of ë there is some history
h for which suph l = s, which implies l ∈ Cs .
“⇒”: Let s ∈ ë, and let l ∈ Cs , i.e., l < s and for some h ∈ Hs , suph l = s.
By Lemma 3, l < e. Take some h ∈ He , and pick some J ∈ Ce , so J < e,

268

N. Belnap et al.

and hence J ⊆ h . Then we also have J < s (given s ∈ ë), which gives us
J ⊆ h. We have suph l = s = suph J. Thus, by the Weiner postulate, we
also have suph l = suph J = e, and therefore, l ∈ Ce .
It follows that the set ë is independent of the witness chosen:
Fact 16. Let s ∈ ë. Then e ∈ s̈.
Proof. Let s ∈ ë. We have to show that e ∈ s̈, i.e., e ∈ S (I) for all I ∈ Cs .
Thus consider an arbitrary I ∈ Cs . By Fact 15, I ∈ Ce . Now take some
h ∈ He ; we have suph I = e, i.e., e ∈ S (I). As I was arbitrary, we have
e ∈ s̈.
Lemma 4. We have s ∈ ë iﬀ ë = s̈.
Proof. “⇐”: Immediate, since s ∈ s̈ by Deﬁnition 15.
“⇒”: Let s ∈ ë. For s = e there is nothing to prove, so we assume s  = e.
“⊆”: Let x ∈ ë. We have to show that x ∈ s̈, i.e., that x ∈ S (l) for all
l ∈ Cs . Thus, take some l ∈ Cs . By Fact 15, l ∈ Ce , and as x ∈ ë, we have
x ∈ S (l).
“⊇”: Let x ∈ s̈. Take some l ∈ Ce . As above, by Fact 15, l ∈ Cs , and as
x ∈ s̈, we have x ∈ S (l).
Having prepared the ground, we can now ﬁnally justify calling the partition Πë the set of local history-wise alternatives: The set of sets of histories
Πë partitions the set of histories containing Pe . That is, any history containing the whole proper past of e ends up in exactly one of the elements of
Πë .
Theorem 3. Let e ∈ W . Then Πë partitions H[Pe ] , i.e.: (1) For H1 , H2 ∈
Πë , if H1  = H2 , then H1 ∩ H2 = ∅; (2) ∪Πë = Hë = H[Pe ] .
Proof. (1) Let H1 , H2 ∈ Πë . By Fact 9(2), if H1  = H2 , then H1 ∩ H2 = ∅.
(2) We have to show that ∪Πë = H[Pe ] . Note that ∪Πë = Hë by Fact 9(2).
“⊆”: Take h ∈ ∪Πë , i.e., h ∈ Hs for some s ∈ ë. By the deﬁnition of Ps , we
have Ps ⊆ h, and by Lemma 3, Pe ⊆ h. Thus, h ∈ H[Pe ] .
“⊇”: Take h ∈ H[Pe ] , so that Pe ⊆ h. By Fact 5, for all l ∈ Ce we have
l ⊆ h. Take some l0 ∈ Ce , and let s =df suph l0 . We can show that s is
the h-relative supremum of any chain from Ce . Fix some h ∈ He . Take any
l ∈ Ce . We have suph l = e = suph l0 , and thus by Weiner’s postulate we
also have suph l = suph l0 = s. Thus we have s ∈ S (l) for any l ∈ Ce , which
implies s ∈ ë. As h ∈ Hs , we have h ∈ ∪Πë .

The main message of the constructions studied in this section is that some
e ∈ W generate non-trivial choice sets ë, in the sense that ë  = {e}. Such
a set ë indeed consists of local point-wise alternatives to e. We can think
of a choice set as a set of “indeterministic transitions”, and each choice set
induces a set of history-wise alternatives for e, namely Πë . Finally, PCPNF
requires that any two histories split at a choice set. So, in BSTNF the basic
concepts of branching histories still apply, but in a slightly diﬀerent way from
BST92 . As we will show now, this has the beneﬁcial topological consequences
announced earlier.

The Diamond Topology in BSTNF

In this section we return to the motivation of this paper, that is, the idea
that a framework for local indeterminism should preserve local Euclidicity: if
each history (space-time) is locally Euclidean of dimension n, then the global
topology should be locally Euclidean of dimension n as well. As we saw in
Section 3.2, the diamond topology on BST92 structures does not preserve
local Euclidicity when moving from the history-relative topologies to the
global topology. In contrast, we can prove that the diamond topology on
BSTNF structures preserves local Euclidicity. Working towards Theorem 4
about the preservation of local Euclidicity, we ﬁrst need an auxiliary lemma,
which is also of interest of its own. Recall the disturbing feature of BST92
discussed in Section 3.2: a set that is open in a history-relative topology
need not be open in the corresponding global topology. In fact, no such set
is open in the global topology if it contains a choice point. The Lemma
below states that the opposite holds for the diamond topology on BSTNF
structures:
Lemma 5. Let a BSTNF model W,  be given, let h ∈ Hist(W ), and let
Z ⊆ W be such that Z ∈ Th , i.e., Z is an open set w.r.t. the history-relative
topology Th . Then Z ∈ T , i.e., Z is also open w.r.t. the global topology on
W.
Proof. Let Z ∈ Th for some h ∈ Hist. Let e ∈ Z, and let t ∈ M C(e). In
order to establish the openness of Z w.r.t T , we need to show that there
is an e-centered diamond with vertices on t wholly contained in Z. The
openness of Z w.r.t. Th gives us such a diamond for any th ∈ M Ch (e), but
not necessarily for our given t ∈ M C(e).
We show that the given t has a segment both below and above e that is
contained in some th ∈ M Ch (e), proceeding in two steps. First, we claim
that t contains some e ∈ h for which e > e. Assume otherwise, i.e., the
chain t+ =df {e∗ ∈ t | e∗ > e} contains no element of h. Note that by

270

N. Belnap et al.

construction, inf t+ = e. As t+ is a chain, it is directed, and thus wholly
contained in some history h2 . Pulling these facts together, t+ ⊆ h2 \ h,
and by the maximality of t and the construction of t+ , we have that t+
is a maximal chain in h2 \ h. The PCPNF gives us a choice set c̈ s.t. (†)
h ⊥c̈ h2 , and for the c ∈ c̈ ∩ h2 , we have c  t+ . We observe next that
from the fact that t+ is a maximal chain in h2 \ h, it follows that c = inf t+ .
Otherwise, for i = inf t+ we would have c < i  t+ . By (†) we have c  ∈ h,
so {c } ∪ t+ ⊆ h2 \ h. As this chain extends t+ , it contradicts the maximality
of t+ in h2 \ h. Thus, c = inf t+ , whence c = e. It follows that e ∈ h2 \ h,
which contradicts our initial assumption that e ∈ h. So indeed, t contains
some e ∈ h for which e > e.
Second, we construct th by starting with an initial segment of the given
t, as follows: Let t− =df {e∗ ∈ t | e∗  e }; we have t− ⊆ h and e ∈ t− .
By the Zorn-Kuratowski lemma we can extend t− with elements of h to
form a maximal chain th , so that th ∈ M Ch (e). The chains t and th share
the initial segment t− . We can now invoke the openness of Z w.r.t. Th
for e and th , which gives us a diamond Deh1 ,eh2 ⊆ Z for which eh1 , eh2 ∈ th
and eh1 < e < eh2 . We set e1 =df eh1 and e2 =df min{e , eh2 }. We thus have
e1 < e < e2 with e1 = eh1 ∈ t, and also e2 ∈ t because e ∈ t. And
as the diamond De1 ,e2 ⊆ Deh1 ,eh2 , we have De1 ,e2 ⊆ Z. So we have found
the witnessing e-centered diamond with vertices on t, which establishes the
openness of Z w.r.t. T .
With the above lemma at hand, we can prove the mentioned theorem:
Theorem 4. Let W, < be a BSTNF structure. If there is an n ∈ N such
that for every h ∈ Hist(W ), the topological space h, Th  is locally Euclidean
with dimension n, then the topological space W, T  is also locally Euclidean
with dimension n.
Proof. We need to show that each e ∈ W has a neighborhood Oe ∈ T that
is mapped by some homeomorphism ϕe to an open set Re ∈ T (Rn ). Let
e ∈ W , and pick some h ∈ He . Since h is locally Euclidean with respect to
Th , there is a Th -open neighborhood Oeh ⊆ h of e, an open set of Rn , Reh ∈
T (Rn ), and a homeomorphism ϕhe such that ϕhe [Oeh ] = Reh . By Lemma 5,
from Oeh ∈ Th it follows that Oeh ∈ T . We let Oe =df Oeh , Re =df Reh , and
we can use ϕe =df ϕhe as our homeomorphism between the open sets Oe ∈ T
and Re ∈ T (Rn ).
BSTNF thus vindicates the idea that if one starts with locally Euclidean
histories (space-times) that allow for the assignment of spatio-temporal coordinates, one does not destroy that feature by analyzing indeterminism

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

within the framework of branching space-times. This is in marked contrast
with the situation in BST92 , in which local Euclidicity does not transfer
from the individual histories to the global branching structure.19 So, if one
wants to analyze local indeterminism in branching structures that retain
local Euclidicity, one has to choose the framework of BSTNF .
With respect to the topological condition of Hausdorﬀness, on the other
hand, the two frameworks are on a par: Apart from some trivial cases,20
both BST92 structures and BSTNF structures are non-Hausdorﬀ even if their
individual histories are Hausdorﬀ.
What is the signiﬁcance of the failure of transferring topological properties of individual histories to the global structure? Arguably, transfer
of local Euclidicity is much more important. Local Euclidicity guarantees
the ascription of spatio-temporal coordinates (sets of real numbers) to any
spatio-temporal event. The idea that such events have coordinates is deeply
entrenched in our concept of space-time. Perhaps there are ways to ascribe
coordinates to events that do not require local Euclidicity, but that condition is used in standard physical theories of space-time. Thus, abandoning
local Euclidicity will mark a revolutionary break with with the established
practice of physics. We thus claim that local Euclidicity should hold both
in each history (individual space-time) and in a global BST structure that
represents the totality of all possible spatio-temporal events.
The Hausdorﬀ property has a diﬀerent status. It is standardly postulated
to hold in structures representing space-times in General Relativity: theses
structures, diﬀerential manifolds, are Hausdorﬀ by deﬁnition. However, there
have been attempts to relax the Hausdorﬀ property, motivated by particular
candidates for space-time. It can also be argued that the Hausdorﬀ property
is not needed in General Relativity and can be abandoned at a small price
[9]. Finally, there is a method of gluing (Hausdorﬀ) diﬀerential manifolds
into a larger structure, a so-call generalized manifold, that is not Haudorﬀ.
It is natural to interpret this result as a modal representation of a family
of alternative space-times that overlap on some region [10]. Accordingly,
histories should be Hausdorﬀ, but global structures with multiple alternative
histories will violate Hausdorﬀness.

19

Compare our discussion following Deﬁnition 11 in Section 3.2.
Main examples are one-dimensional structures of BST92 such as pictured in Figure 1.
Also, one-history structures are, of course, Hausdorﬀ if their single history is.

From New Foundations to Old Foundations and Back Again

Our target in this section is a set of theorems establishing that we can move
freely between BST92 and BSTNF while preserving the basic indeterministic
structure. In Section 5.1 we will show that given a BSTNF structure, we
can deﬁne an accompanying BST92 structure via a transformation detailed
in Deﬁnition 20, in parallel to the derivation of a BSTNF structure from a
BST92 structure above. In Section 5.2, we will then show that the concatenation of these two translations, in any order, is an order isomorphism. In
this way, BST92 and BSTNF can be seen as two alternative representations
of the same underlying indeterministic structure. This means that we can
represent indeterministic scenarios without having to decide between the
diﬀerent prior choice principles of BST92 and BSTNF .
5.1.

From New Foundations BSTNF to BST92

We have seen how the move from a BST92 structure to its full transition
structure brings us from BST92 to BSTNF . In the other direction, there
is also a fairly simple translation, viz., combining, or collapsing, all the
elements of a choice set to form a single point. The elements of a choice set
constitute diﬀerent history-relative suprema of a chain without an endpoint.
The transform, in contrast, contains a chain with a unique endpoint, after
which the diﬀerent outcomes have no ﬁrst elements.
Definition 20. (The Λ transformation from BSTNF to BST92 .) Let W, <
be a BSTNF model. Then we deﬁne the companion Λ-transformed (“collapsed”) model as follows:21
Λ(W, <) =df W  , < ,


W =df {ë | e ∈ W };

where
e¨1 < e¨2

iﬀ

e1 < e2

for some

e1 ∈ e¨1 , e2 ∈ e¨2 .

It will be useful to extend the Λ-notation to elements and subsets of W , so
that Λ(e) =df ë, and Λ(E) =df {ë | e ∈ E}.
Fact 17. (Facts about Deﬁnition 20) The following holds:
1. Let e1 , e2 ∈ W and let e1 < e2 . Then Λ(e1 ) < Λ(e2 ).
2. Let t ⊆ W be a chain (w.r.t. <). Then Λ(t) is a chain (w.r.t. < ).
3. Let E ⊆ W be directed. Then Λ(E) is also directed.
21

Graphically, we have chosen “Λ” as the reverse of “Υ”. Note that from here on, we
denote the BSTNF structures as (unprimed) W, < and the Λ-transformed structures with
primes.

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

Proof. (1): holds by the deﬁnition of < . (2) and (3) follow immediately.
Fact 18. (Justiﬁcation of the notation in Deﬁnition 20) In BSTNF : (1) If
e1 < e2 and e2 ∈ e¨2 , then e1 < e2 . So we can write e1 < e¨2 . (2) If e1 < e¨2
and e∗1 ∈ e¨1 , e1  = e∗1 , then e∗1  < e¨2 . So given e¨1 < e¨2 , there is a unique
e1 ∈ e¨1 for which e1 < e¨2 . (3) If e¨1 < e¨2 , then there are no e∗i ∈ e¨i (i = 1, 2)
for which e∗2 < e∗1 .
Proof. (1): By Fact 15.
(2): Let e1 < e¨2 as witnessed by e2 (i.e., e1 < e2 ), and e∗1 ∈ e¨1 , e1  = e∗1 .
Assume for reductio e∗1 < e¨2 , then there has to be some witness e∗2 ∈ ë2 for
which e∗1 < e∗2 . Then by (1), we also have e∗1 < e2 , so that (by downward
closure of histories) there is a history containing e1 and e∗1 , contradicting
Fact 9(1).
(3): Let ë1 < ë2 as witnessed by e1 and e2 (i.e., e1 ∈ ë1 , e2 ∈ ë2 , and
e1 < e2 ). Assume for reductio that there are e∗1 ∈ ë1 and e∗2 ∈ ë2 for which
e∗2 < e∗1 . Then by (1), we have e1 < e∗2 , and by transitivity, e1 < e∗1 . Thereby
e1 and e∗1 , being diﬀerent elements of ë1 (by irreﬂexivity of <), would have
to belong to one history, contradicting Fact 9(1).
Similarly to what we established about the properties of the transition
structure of a BST92 structure, we can characterize the Λ-transform of a
BSTNF structure. It turns out that, as announced, the Λ-transform leads us
back to BST92 . As above, we split the proof into a number of steps.
Fact 19. Let W, < be a BSTNF model, and let W  , <  =df Λ(W, <).
Then W  , <  is (1) non-empty and (2) a strict partial ordering (3) without
minima or maxima.
Proof. (1) By construction, W  is non-empty (given that W was nonempty).
(2) Asymmetry follows from Fact 18(3). For transitivity, let ë1 < ë2 and
ë2 < ë3 . Then by Fact 18(2), there is a unique e2 ∈ ë2 for which e2 < ë3 ,
and a unique e1 ∈ ë1 for which e1 < ë2 . So by e2 ∈ ë2 and by transitivity
of < we have e1 < ë3 , which proves ë1 < ë3 .
(3) Let ë ∈ W  . There is some e1 ∈ W for which ë = Λ(e1 ). As W has no
maximal nor minimal elements, there are e2 , e3 ∈ W for which e2 < e1 < e3 .
Then by the deﬁnition of the ordering, ë2 < Λ(e1 ) = ë, establishing that ë
cannot be a minimum, and Λ(e1 ) = ë < ë3 , establishing that ë cannot be a
maximum.
Before we can establish history-relative suprema of upper bounded chains,
we need to prove a lemma about the form of histories in W  .

274

N. Belnap et al.

Lemma 6. Let W, < be a BSTNF model, and let W  , <  =df Λ(W, <).
The histories (maximal directed sets) in W  , <  are exactly the sets Λ(h),
for h ∈ Hist(W ). That is, (1) for h ∈ Hist(W ), the set Λ(h) is maximal
directed and (2) for any maximal directed set h ∈ Hist(W  ) there is a unique
history h ∈ Hist(W ) s.t. h = Λ(h).
Proof. (1) The set Λ(h) ⊆ W  is directed by Fact 17(3), so there is
some maximal directed h ∈ Hist(W  ) for which Λ(h) ⊆ h . Note that by
Facts 19(3) and 1 (5), h cannot have a maximum. This allows us to deﬁne
a function f : h → W that establishes the converse of Λ on h , in the following sense: (i) for any ë ∈ h , Λ(f (ë)) = ë, (ii) for any ë1 , ë2 ∈ h , we have
ë1 < ë2 iﬀ f (ë1 ) < f (ë2 ), and (iii) for any e ∈ h, f (Λ(e)) = e. (Note that
the primed histories and the primed ordering refer to Λ(W, <), not to the
BSTNF structure.)
To deﬁne f , let ë1 ∈ h . Let ë2 ∈ h s.t. ë1 < ë2 ; such an element exists
as h has no maxima. By Fact 18(2), there is a unique v ∈ W for which
ë1 = Λ(v) and v < ë2 . That v is, moreover, independent of the chosen
upper bound ë2 ∈ h : let v ∗ ∈ ë1 be such that v ∗ < ë3 for some ë3 ∈ h for
which ë1 < ë3 . Then by directedness of h , there is some common upper
bound ë4 of ë2 and ë3 , and again invoking Fact 18(2), we have v ∗ = v. So we
can set f (ë1 ) = v as speciﬁed. Note that thereby, f (ë1 ) ∈ ë1 . Constraint (i)
holds by construction, as Λ(f (ë)) = Λ(v) = ë. For (ii, “⇒”), let ë1 , ë2 ∈ h
satisfy ë1 < ë2 . Then f (ë1 ) < ë2 by construction (as ë2 is an upper bound
of ë1 in h ), and the claim follows by Fact 18(1), noting that f (ë2 ) ∈ ë2 .
For (ii, “⇐”), let ë1 , ë2 ∈ h be such that f (ë1 ) < f (ë2 ). By (i) and by the
deﬁnition of the ordering < , this implies ë1 < ë2 . For (iii), let e1 ∈ h. As h
contains no maxima, there is some e2 ∈ h for which e1 < e2 . Let ëi = Λ(ei )
(i = 1, 2), so that (by the deﬁnition of < ) we have ë1 < ë2 . By the deﬁnition
of f , f (ë1 ) = e∗ for the unique member e∗ ∈ ë1 for which e∗ < ë2 . Given
e1 < e2 , we have e∗ = e1 , i.e., f (Λ(e1 )) = f (ë1 ) = e1 .
Now for maximality of the directed set Λ(h) ⊆ h , assume for reductio
that h = Λ(h) ∪ A with Λ(h) ∩ A = ∅ and A  = ∅ (i.e., assume that Λ(h)
is not maximal directed). Let A =df {f (ë) | ë ∈ A }, so that A  = ∅ and
A ∩ h = ∅. By property (ii) of f , h ∪ A is directed, violating the maximality
of h.
(2) Let h ∈ Hist(W  ), and deﬁne f as above. Let E =df {f (ë) | ë ∈ h },
so that by (i), Λ(E) = h . By (ii), E is directed, so that there is some
h ∈ Hist(W ) with E ⊆ h. It follows that h = Λ(E) ⊆ Λ(h). By (1), we
have that Λ(h) = h for some h ∈ Hist(W  ). So we have two histories
h , h ∈ Hist(W  ) for which h ⊆ h , whence, by Fact 1(3), h = h . This

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

275

means that we have found some h ∈ Hist(W ) for which Λ(h) = h . For
uniqueness of h, let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W ) be such that Λ(h1 ) = Λ(h2 ) = h .
Then h1 = f (h ) and h2 = f (h ), establishing h1 = h2 .
Lemma 7. Let W, < be a BSTNF structure. Then its Λ-transform,
W  , <  =df Λ(W, <), is a common BST structure.
Proof. Our task is to show that W  , <  satisﬁes the postulates of Deﬁnition 2.
1. Non-emptiness: By Fact 19(1).
2. Partial odering: By Fact 19(2).
3. No maximal nor minimal elements: By Fact 19(3).
4. < is dense.
Let ë1 < ë2 , so by Fact 18(2), there is a unique e1 ∈ ë1 for which e1 < ë2 .
Let e2 ∈ ë2 ; in particular, e1 < e2 . By density of <, we have e∗ ∈ W
s.t. e1 < e∗ < e2 . By the deﬁnition of the < ordering, this establishes
ë1 = Λ(e1 ) < Λ(e∗ ) < Λ(e2 ) = ë2 , which proves density of < .
5. Lower bounded chains have inﬁma in < .
Let t ⊆ W  be a lower bounded chain, and let b̈ ∈ W  be a lower bound
for t . The elements of t are of the form ë = Λ(e) with e ∈ W . We
distinguish two cases. (a) If t has a least element (which covers the case
that t has only one element), then that least element is the inﬁmum of
t w.r.t. < , by deﬁnition. (b) If t has no least element, pick some ë ∈ t ,
and let t∗ =df {x ∈ t | x < ë}. We have inf t∗ = inf t by the deﬁnition of
the inﬁmum. And by Fact 18(2), for all ë1 ∈ t∗ there are unique e1 ∈ W
for which e1 ∈ ë1 and e1 < ë, and there is a unique b∗ ∈ b̈ for which
b∗ < ë. So there is a unique set t ⊆ W given by
t = {e1 ∈ W | e1 < ë ∧ ë1 ∈ t∗ },
which is a chain since t∗ is a chain; further t is lower bounded by b∗ ∈ W .
By the properties of BSTNF , t therefore has an inﬁmum a =df inf t,
a ∈ W . We claim that ä is the inﬁmum of t w.r.t. < . As a < t, we have
ä < t by the deﬁnition of < . Now let c̈  t . Again by Fact 18(2), there
is a unique c ∈ c̈ for which c < ë. By the fact that a is the inﬁmum of
t, we have c  a, which implies c̈  ä. So ä is indeed the greatest lower
bound, i.e., the inﬁmum, of t .
6. Upper bounded chains have history-relative suprema in < .
Let t be an upper bounded chain with b̈ an upper bound, and let b̈ ∈ h
for h some history in W  , < , so that t ⊆ h as well. As h has a unique

276

N. Belnap et al.

pre-image h under Λ (by Lemma 6), also b̈ and t have unique pre-images
b ∈ h and t ⊆ h. So by the BSTNF axioms, t has an h-relative supremum
s ∈ h. By Fact 17(1), we have t  s̈, and for any ä ∈ h for which
t  ä, we can consider the unique pre-image a ∈ h ∩ ä, for which t  a.
By the fact that s is the h-relative supremum of t, we have s  a, which
translates into s̈  ä, i.e., s̈ is the least upper bound in h , and therefore
the h -relative supremum, of t .
7. The Weiner postulate.
Consider two histories h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W  ), two chains l , k  ⊆ h1 ∩ h2 , and
their history-relative suprema s̈i = suphi l and c̈i = suphi k (i = 1, 2).
Assume that s̈1  c̈1 . We denote the unique pre-images of h1 , h2 , l , k  , s̈1 ,
s̈2 , c̈1 , and c̈2 under Λ by h1 , h2 , l, k, s1 , s2 , c1 , and c2 , respectively. By
the uniqueness of pre-images and properties of < , we have l, k ⊆ h1 ∩ h2 ,
si = suphi (l), ci = suphi (k) (i = 1, 2), and s1  c1 . Then by the Weiner
Postulate of BSTNF , s2  c2 . Since s̈2 = Λ(s2 ) and c̈2 = Λ(c2 ), we have
s̈2  c̈2 .
8. Historical connection. Pick h1 , h2 histories in W  , < , and consider their
unique pre-images h1 , h2 by Λ, which by Lemma 6 are histories in the
BSTNF structure W, <. By historical connection for BSTNF structures,
we have h1 ∩ h2  = ∅. Hence Λ(h1 ) ∩ Λ(h2 )  = ∅, i.e., h1 ∩ h2  = ∅.
Lemma 8. The Λ-transform W, < =df Λ(W, <) of a BSTNF structure
W, < satisﬁes the BST92 prior choice principle.
Proof. Let h1 , h2 be histories in W  , < , and let t ⊆ h1 \ h2 be a lower
bounded chain in h1 that contains no element of h2 . We have to ﬁnd a
maximal element c ∈ h1 ∩ h2 that lies below t , c < t , and for which
h1 ⊥c h2 . The histories h1 , h2 have as unique pre-images the W, <-histories
h1 , h2 . As t ⊆ h1 , the unique pre-image t ⊆ h1 . Furthermore, t ∩ h2 = ∅, for
an element e ∈ t ∩ h2 would give rise to ë ∈ t ∩ h2 , violating our assumption
about t . So t ⊆ h1 \ h2 . From the BSTNF prior choice principle, we have a
choice set s̈ and s1 ∈ h1 ∩ s̈ for which s1  t, while there is some s2 ∈ s̈ ∩ h2 .
Let c =df Λ(s1 ) = s̈; we claim that c is the sought-for choice point. (a) By
Lemma 4 we have s̈1 = s̈2 , and as si ∈ hi , we have s̈i ∈ hi (i = 1, 2), so
that c = s̈1 = s̈2 ∈ h1 ∩ h2 . (b) As c lies in the intersection of h1 and h2 ,
it cannot be that s̈1 ∈ t . This excludes s1 ∈ t, so that in fact s1 < t. This
in turn implies c = s̈1 < t . (c) For the maximality of c in h1 ∩ h2 , assume
that there is ä ∈ h1 ∩ h2 for which c < ä. Then we have a unique pre-image
a1 ∈ h1 ∩ h2 for which both s1 < a1 and s2 < a1 , so that both s1 and s2
belong to history h1 . This contradicts Fact 9(1). So c = s̈ is in fact maximal
in h1 ∩ h2 . (d) By the deﬁnition of ⊥c , we therefore have h1 ⊥c h2 .

Theorem 5. The Λ-transform Λ(W, <) of a BSTNF structure W, < is
a BST92 structure.
Proof. By Lemma 7 and Lemma 8.
5.2.

Going Full Circle

We have now established that there is a way to get from BST92 structures
to BSTNF structures and from BSTNF structures to BST92 structures. This
raises the question of where we land when we concatenate these transformations. We can show that, as hoped, we land where we started: the resulting
structures are order-isomorphic to the ones we started with. Since all important notions of BST are deﬁned in terms of the ordering, this means that
in the relevant sense, the Λ transform of the Υ transform of a BST92 structure is that original BST92 structure (Theorem 6), and the Υ transform
of the Λ transform of a BSTNF structure is that original BSTNF structure
(Theorem 7).
5.2.1.

From BST92 to BSTNF to BST92

Theorem 6. The function Λ ◦ Υ is an order isomorphism of BST92 structures: Let W1 , <1  be a BST92 structure, let W2 , <2  =df Υ(W1 , <1 ),
and let W3 , <3  =df Λ(W2 , <2 ). Then there is an order isomorphism ϕ
between W1 , <1  and W3 , <3 , i.e., a bijection between W1 and W3 that
preserves the ordering.
Proof. We claim that we can use the mapping ϕ, deﬁned for e ∈ W1 to
be
ϕ(e) =df {e  H | H ∈ Πe }.
We have to show (1) that ϕ is indeed a mapping from W1 to W3 , (2) that
ϕ is injective, (3) that ϕ is surjective, and (4) that ϕ preserves the ordering.
(1) Mapping: We have to show that for any e ∈ W1 , ϕ(e) = {e  H |
H ∈ Πe } ∈ W3 . The set W2 is the full transition structure of W1 , <1 , so
that for e ∈ W1 and for any H ∈ Πe , the transition e  H ∈ W2 . Thus,
for e ∈ W1 , the set ϕ(e) ⊆ W2 . The set W3 contains, for any τ ∈ W2 , the
set Λ(τ ) = τ̈ ∈ W3 , and τ̈ ⊆ W2 as well. Let now e ∈ W1 , and pick some
H ∗ ∈ Πe ,which ﬁxes some τ = e  H ∗ ∈ W2 . We claim that
τ̈ = {e  H | H ∈ Πe },
which establishes τ̈ = ϕ(e), so that indeed, ϕ(e) ∈ W3 . The claim is an
equality between subsets of W2 , so that we show inclusion both ways.

“⊆”: Let τ  = e  H  ∈ τ̈ ; we have to show that τ  ∈ {e  H | H ∈
Πe }. We have τ ∈ h and τ  ∈ h for h, h ∈ Hist(W2 ). By Lemma 1 we know
that these histories are of the form
h = {e1  Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ h1 };

h = {e1  Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ h1 }

for some h1 , h1 ∈ Hist(W1 ). The set τ̈ is deﬁned as the intersection of all sets
of history-relative suprema of any chain l ⊆ W2 ending in, but not containing
τ (l ∈ Cτ ), so that for any l ∈ Cτ , we have suph l = τ and suph l = τ  , since
τ  ∈ τ̈ . As τ = e  H ∗ ∈ h, we have e ∈ h1 . We now claim that e ∈ h1 as
well. Assume otherwise, so that e ∈ h1 \ h1 . By PCP92 , there is then some
c <1 e for which h1 ⊥c h1 . Let τc =df c  Πc h1 , so that τc ∈ h and
τc <2 τ . There is thus some chain l ∈ Cτ for which τc ∈ l. As suph l = τ 
(by τ  ∈ τ̈ , see above), we have l ⊆ h , which implies τc ∈ h and c ∈ h1 .
From the form of elements of h we therefore must have Πc h1  = Πc h1 ,
contradicting h1 ⊥c h1 . So indeed e ∈ h1 ∩ h1 .
Now take some l ∈ Cτ ; we have l ⊆ W2 and indeed l ⊆ h ∩ h . Let l1
be the set of initials of the elements of l, i.e., l1 ⊆ W1 and l = {e1 
Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ l1 }. Note that suph1 l1 = e = suph1 l1 from suph l = τ and
e ∈ h1 ∩ h1 , and as l ⊆ h ∩ h , we have Πe1 h1  = Πe1 h1  for all e1 ∈ l1 .
We now claim that suph l = τ  =df e  Πe h1 . We have τ  ∈ h because
e ∈ h1 , and l <2 τ  because l1 <1 e, so τ  is an upper bound of l in h . Let
now τ ∗ = e∗  Πe∗ h1  ∈ h be some upper bound of l in h . Then e∗ is an
upper bound of l1 in h1 , and thus e 1 e∗ as suph1 l1 = e, so that τ  2 τ ∗ ,
proving that τ  is the h -relative supremum of l. So we have shown that
τ  = e  Πe h1  = suph l = τ  . So indeed, τ  ∈ {e  H | H ∈ Πe }.
“⊇”: Let τ  ∈ {e  H | H ∈ Πe }, i.e., τ  = e  H for the e in question
and for some H ∈ Πe . We have to show that τ  ∈ τ̈ . We have τ ∈ h and
τ  ∈ h for some h, h ∈ Hist(W2 ), which are again of the form
h = {e1  Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ h1 };

h = {e1  Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ h1 }

for some h1 , h1 ∈ Hist(W1 ), so that τ  = e  Πe h1 .
Let l ∈ Cτ ; we have suph l = τ = e  H ∗ by assumption. We now claim
that suph l = τ  , which establishes τ  ∈ τ̈ . To prove that τ  is the h -relative
supremum of l, as above, let l1 be the set of initials of the elements l, so that
l1 ⊆ W1 and l = {e1  Πe1 h1  | e1 ∈ l1 }. Again as above, l1 <1 e, and thus
τ  is an upper bound of l in h . Let now τ ∗ = e∗  Πe∗ h1  ∈ h be some
upper bound of l in h . Then e∗ ∈ h1 is an upper bound of l1 in h1 , and thus
e 1 e∗ as suph1 l1 = e (note that e ∈ h1 as τ  ∈ h ). Therefore τ  2 τ ∗ ,
proving that τ  is the h -relative supremum of l. As l was an arbitrary chain
from Cτ , we have indeed τ  ∈ τ̈ .

(2) Injectivity: Let e, e ∈ W1 with e  = e . Then ϕ(e)  = ϕ(e ). This is
clear as the sets ϕ(e) and ϕ(e ) have diﬀerent members.
(3) Surjectivity: Let a ∈ W3 . We have to ﬁnd some e ∈ W1 for which
ϕ(e) = a. As a ∈ W3 , we have a = τ̈ for some τ = e  H ∈ W2 , where
e ∈ W1 and H ∈ Πe . Above under (1) we have established that for τ = e 
H ∈ W2 , we have τ̈ = {e  H | H ∈ Πe }, i.e., a = τ̈ = ϕ(e).
(4) Order preservation: We have to show that for e1 , e2 ∈ W1 , e1 <1 e2
iﬀ ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ). (The claim about equality follows from the fact that ϕ is
a bijection.) We know from the deﬁnition of ϕ that ϕ(ei ) = {ei  H | H ∈
Πei } (i = 1, 2).
“⇒”: Let e1 , e2 ∈ W1 with e1 <1 e2 , and let h2 ∈ He2 . Let τ1 =df e1 
Πe1 h2  and τ2 =df e2  H for some H ∈ Πe2 ; we have τ1 , τ2 ∈ W2 and
ϕ(ei ) = τ¨i (i = 1, 2). By the deﬁnition of the transition ordering <2 , we have
τ1 <2 τ2 , and by the deﬁnition of <3 in terms of instances, we thus have
τ¨1 <3 τ¨2 , i.e., ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ).
“⇐”: Let ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ), i.e., there are some τ1 ∈ ϕ(e1 ), τ2 ∈ ϕ(e2 ) for
which τ1 <2 τ2 . These transitions have the form τi = ei  Hi for some
ei ∈ W1 and Hi ∈ Πei (i = 1, 2). Thus, in particular, from τ1 <2 τ2 we have
that e1 <1 e2 .
5.2.2. From BSTNF to BST92 to BSTNF Before we can tackle the main
Theorem 7, we need to establish an additional fact.
Fact 20. Let W1 , <1  be a BSTNF structure and W2 , <2  =df Λ(W1 , <1 )
the corresponding BST92 structure. Then for any h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W1 ), we have
h1 ⊥1ë h2 iﬀ Λ(h1 ) ⊥2ë Λ(h2 ), where ⊥ië is the relation of splitting for histories
in Wi .
Proof. “⇒”: Let h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W1 ), and let h1 ⊥1ë h2 . Then there are
e1 , e2 ∈ ë s.t. e1  = e2 and hi ∩ ë = ei (i = 1, 2). Then Λ(e1 ) = Λ(e2 ) = ë,
so ë ∈ Λ(h1 ) ∩ Λ(h2 ). Moreover, ë is maximal in Λ(h1 ) ∩ Λ(h2 ), which
establishes Λ(h1 ) ⊥2ë Λ(h2 ). To prove this, assume for reductio that there is
some ë >2 ë in the intersection of Λ(h1 ) and Λ(h2 ). This means that there
are some e1 , e2 ∈ ë with e1 ∈ h1 , e2 ∈ h2 , and Λ(e1 ) = Λ(e2 ) = ë . The
ordering ë <2 ë implies that for some e∗ ∈ ë, e∗ <2 ë1 , which further implies
that e∗ <1 e1 and e∗ <1 e2 . But then e∗ ∈ h1 ∩ h2 , and by Fact 18(2), it
must be that e∗ = e1 = e2 , which contradicts h1 ⊥1ë h2 .
“⇐”: Let Λ(h1 ) ⊥2ë Λ(h2 ), which implies that ë ∈ Λ(h1 ) ∩ Λ(h2 ). Note
that there are ei s.t. ei ∈ hi and Λ(ei ) = ë (i = 1, 2). Therefore, hi ∩ ë  = ∅,
so that h1 and h2 fulﬁll the precondition for either h1 ≡1ë h2 or h1 ⊥1ë h2 (see
Deﬁnition 17). For reductio, assume the former, which means that h1 ∩ ë =

280

h2 ∩ ë, i.e., e1 = e2 . As there are no maxima in the intersection of histories
in BSTNF (Fact 12), there is some e∗ ∈ h1 ∩ h2 for which e1 <1 e∗ . Now
for ë∗ =df Λ(e∗ ) we have ë∗ ∈ Λ(h1 ) ∩ Λ(h2 ), and ë <2 ë∗ . This, however,
contradicts the maximality of ë implied by Λ(h1 ) ⊥2ë Λ(h2 ). So in fact, we
have h1 ⊥1ë h2 .
Note that by contraposing the above Fact (and making a simple observation) we have that for any h1 , h2 ∈ Hist(W1 ), h1 ≡1ë h2 iﬀ Λ(h1 ) ≡2ë Λ(h2 ).
Theorem 7. The function Υ ◦ Λ is an order isomorphism of BSTNF structures: Let W1 , <1  be a BSTNF structure, let W2 , <2  =df Λ(W1 , <1 ),
and let W3 , <3  =df Υ(W2 , <2 ). Then there is an order isomorphism ϕ
between W1 , <1  and W3 , <3 , i.e., a bijection between W1 and W3 that
preserves the ordering.
Proof. We claim that we can use the mapping ϕ, deﬁned for e ∈ W1 to
be
ϕ(e) =df ë  Πë Λ(h) for arbitrary h ∈ He ⊆ Hist1 .
First we show that ϕ(e) is well-deﬁned. Thus, let h, h ∈ He ; we need to
show that Πë Λ(h) = Πë Λ(h ). By Lemma 6 (1), Λ(h), Λ(h ) ∈ Hist(W2 ).
Also, by Fact 12, h ≡ë h , and so by Fact 20, Πë Λ(h) = Πë Λ(h ).
We now have to show (1) that ϕ is indeed a mapping from W1 to W3 ,
(2) that ϕ is injective, (3) that ϕ is surjective, and (4) that ϕ preserves the
ordering.
(1) Mapping: We have to show that for any e ∈ W1 , ϕ(e) = ë 
Πë Λ(h) ∈ W3 , where h ∈ He ⊆ Hist1 . The set W3 is deﬁned via W2 ,
and the set W2 = Λ[W1 ], which means that for every e ∈ W1 , ë ∈ W2 . To ë
is then assigned Πë Λ(h), and we need to see if it is an elementary outcome
of ë, i.e., an element of Πë . Since by Lemma 6 Λ(h) is a history in W2 , <2 
for any h ∈ Hist1 and for any h ∈ He , ë = Λ(e) ∈ Λ(h), we get that Πë Λ(h)
is an elementary outcome of ë, so indeed ë  Πë Λ(h) ∈ W3 .
(2) Injectivity: Let e, e ∈ W1 and e  = e . If ë  = ë , then obviously
ϕ(e)  = ϕ(e ), as these two transitions then have diﬀerent initials. If ë = ë
but e  = e , then e and e are incompatible elements of the choice set ë, and
moreover, for any h, h ∈ Hist1 , if e ∈ h, e ∈ h , then h ⊥ë h , and hence
by Fact 20, Λ(h) ⊥ë Λ(h ). Accordingly, Πë Λ(h)  = Πë Λ(h ), and hence
ϕ(e)  = ϕ(e ).
(3) Surjectivity: Let a ∈ W3 . We have to ﬁnd some e ∈ W1 for which
ϕ(e) = a. As a ∈ W3 , we have a = ë  H, where ë ∈ W2 and H ∈ Πë .
Since W2 , <2  is the result of Λ-transform applied to W1 , <1 , there is

New Foundations for Branching Space-Times

281

(possibly more than one) e∗ ∈ W1 for which Λ(e∗ ) = ë . We need to ﬁnd
which of these is the sought-for e. Clearly, there is some h∗ ∈ Hist(W2 ) for
which H = Πë h∗ . By Lemma 6(2), there is a unique h ∈ Hist(W1 ) s.t.
h∗ = Λ(h), and hence H = Πë Λ(h). For the sought-for e we thus take
the unique e ∈ ë ∩ h; clearly ë = ë. It follows that ϕ(e) = ë  H, where
H = Πë Λ(h).
(4) Order preservation: For e1 , e2 ∈ W1 , e1 <1 e2 iﬀ ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ). (The
claim about equality already follows from the fact that ϕ is a bijection.)
“⇒”: Let e1 , e2 ∈ W1 with e1 <1 e2 . We show that ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ). Since
for ϕ(e1 ) we may pick an arbitrary member of He1 , we pick h2 ∈ He2 ⊆
He1 , so that e1 , e2 ∈ h2 . We get, as required, ë1 <2 ë2 and hence, as the
elementary outcomes ϕ(ei ) are deﬁned by the same history Λ(h2 ), we get
Hë2 ⊆ Πë1 Λ(h2 ). Hence, ë1  Πë1 Λ(h2 ) <3 ë2  Πë2 Λ(h2 ).
“⇐”: Let ϕ(e1 ) <3 ϕ(e2 ), i.e., (ë1  Πë1 Λ(h1 ) <3 (ë2  Πë2 Λ(h2 )),
for hi ∈ Hei , ei ∈ ëi . Hence for some e1 ∈ ë1 : (i) e1 <2 ë2 , and hence
Hë2 ⊆ He1 , so h2 ∈ He1 (because He2 ⊆ Hë2 ). Since h2 ∈ He2 ⊆ He1 , and
it is impossible that {e1 , e1 } ⊆ h2 (by Fact 9(1)), it must be that e1 = e1
and hence e1 < e2 (by (i)).

Conclusion

In this paper we developed a branching space-times theory that constitutes
an alternative to the well-studied theory of Belnap [1], BST92 . We describe
both BST92 and our “new foundations” theory, BSTNF , as alternative versions of common BST structures (Deﬁnition 2). The diﬀerence lies in the
way in which histories branch locally, as prescribed by the diﬀerent prior
choice principles, PCP92 (Deﬁnition 6) vs. PCPNF (Deﬁnition 18). On the
one hand, the diﬀerence between BST92 and BSTNF is substantial, as shown
by their diﬀerent topological properties: in BSTNF , locally Euclidean individual histories give rise to a locally Euclidean branching structure, i.e., to
a generalized manifold, whereas in BST92 , local Euclidicity does not carry
over from individual histories to the whole branching structure. On the other
hand, we can prove that both frameworks are formally intertranslatable,
so that BST92 and BSTNF can be viewed as diﬀerent possible representations of a single underlying notion of local indeterminism. In this way, the
development of BSTNF strengthens the position that branching space-times
provides an adequate, formally precise analysis of local indeterminism.

Abstract
The article explores the agreements and disagreements between the author and the
authors of Responsible Brains on howneuroscience relates to moral responsibility.
The agreements are fundamental: neuroscience is not the harbinger of revolutionary
revision of our views ofwhen persons are morally responsible for the harms that they
cause. The disagreements are in the details of what is needed for neuroscience to be
the helper(rather than the challeger) of the moral sciences.

1 Introduction
There is a challenge to commenting on books with which one largely agrees: since
no one wants to see critics join authors in standing shoulder to shoulder and singing Kumbayah together, recitations of the many things on which authors and critics agree is pretty much out. Yet finding points of criticism when there is so much
basic agreement has the danger of exaggerating the disagreements that remain. Fortunately I have just enough genuine disagreement with Hirstein, Sifferd, and Fagan
(hereinafter, “HSF”) that I can manage this brief comment on their sophisticated and
well-written book.1
Such disagreements have to be seen in the context of the more important
things on which HSF and I do agree. Such agreements are both numerous and

significant. They include the facts that: criminal liability is intimately connected
to moral responsibility such that no one should be punished when they are not
responsible; moral responsibility (or “blameworthiness”) is not a primitive
moral property but is itself intimately related to (or “grounded in,” as HSF like
to say) certain natural properties; not included among such natural properties is
the property that the will be free in any contra-causal sense of that phrase but
included among such natural properties is the property of the will by virtue of
which it can cause states of the world to exist that were the objects of such willings; this latter property depends on many more discrete mental capacities such
as those involved in forming accurate beliefs, planning, etc.; these mental capacities themselves are related in an intimate way to (or “grounded in”) the existence
of certain brain structures and processes accurately enough described by HSF as
“executive functioning;” having what HSF call a “minimal working set of such
executive functions” is a prerequisite to any creature being a moral agent, that is,
one who is capable of being morally responsible for their own actions and their
consequences.
My disagreements with any of the foregoing only appear if one bears down on
certain of these beliefs and precisifies them considerably. Take the three “intimate”
relations depicted above, first up being that of criminal law to moral responsibility.
What we share here is important: criminal punishment is limited to morally blameworthy behavior. But what we don’t share is also important: as a retributivist—a
real retributivist, not what HSF call a “limiting retributivist” (p. 211)—I think that
morally responsible wrongdoing merits the moral censure and the suffering that is
criminal punishment, whereas HSF do not. This disagreement colors what HSF look
for in terms of legal payoffs for their executive function neuroscience. Being mixed
theorists about punishment, they seek incapacitative, rehabilitative, and deterrent
insights as some of the legally relevant payoffs of the neuroscience (p. 235), not just
payoffs in terms of diminished blameworthiness. Still, the central legal payoff pursued in the book is the moral payoff of seeing when one is responsible or excused,
so that central emphasis submerges our disagreement here. (Besides, long experience has taught me that cognitive therapy to transform mixed punishment theorists
such as HSF into retributivists has proved of limited efficacy, so it is a task well left
for another occasion.)
A second intimate relation described above is that between moral properties
like blameworthiness and natural properties such as the causal efficacy of choice.
Although both HSF and myself apparently agree in our rejection of any (G.E.)
Moorean non-naturalist primitivism about such moral properties, if we probed
deeper I suspect that disagreements would emerge in how I and they regard moral
properties. For at one point (pp. 44–46) HSF make plain their reliance on the
contested meta-ethics of Strawson (1962). Strawson’s “reactive attitudes” account
of moral responsibility has two well-known meta-ethical interpretations: a metaphysical interpretation according to which the “fitness” or “appropriateness” of
having reactive attitudes towards some behavior constitutes the whole truth of the
matter about the actor’s responsibility for that behavior; and a sociological/psychological interpretation, according to which such fitness only marks contingent

properties such as responsibility but in no sense do such conventions of fitness
determine the existence of such properties. To my way of thinking HSF need to
eschew the first, the metaphysical interpretation of Strawson. This, because they
like the rest of us need to speak of their moral judgments about responsibility as
being true, not just fitting and appropriate. They also need to disentangle moral
judgments of when punishment is not really deserved from judgments about the
sociological conventions that make expression of condemnation inappropriate.
In short, they need to be doing philosophy rather than social science. Yet once
one repairs to the much more reasonable, merely sociological interpretation of
Strawson, Strawsonian sociology of attitudes does very little discernable work in
advancing HSF’s project—for HSW’s project is not to study people’s reactions
to others being thought responsible, but to study what it takes to make people
responsible in reality. Strawson serves only as a kind of pastiche one might put
over the more robustly naturalist-realist meta-ethics to which the authors are perhaps too embarrassed to openly subscribe.
The third intimate relation is that between mental states and brain states.
Again, HSF and I share something basic and foundational, which is some kind
of physicalism which implies the rejection of any form of metaphysical dualism
about this relation. Minds are intimately related to brains despite the fact that
the three salient characteristics of minds—consciousness, agency, and Intentionality—are difficult to relate to what goes on in brains (pp. 125–127). But exactly
how mental states like intention (on which moral responsibility depends) relate
to the brain states studied by neuroscience is not explicitly stated by HSW. Elsewhere I have separated five ways in which such physicalist (that is, non-dualist
and non-idealist) mind-brain relations might be conceived (Moore 2020):
1. Classical reductionism, both ontological and epistemological (or “nomological”)
2. Supposedly “non-reductionist” physicalisms (multiple realizability plus supervenience plus token identity plus functionalism)
3. Componential mechanism, a kind of metaphysical quietism
4. Grounding as primitive
5. Eliminative materialism.
I think that it is plain that HSF must join me in rejecting eliminative materialism, as one needs to do if one is to regard as real the mental states such as
intention on which responsibility is based. HSF do seemingly adopt some form of
“homuncular functionalism” (Moore 1988) in their achieving reduction through
ever smaller and ever simpler (“dumber”) agencies (p. 39); yet this needn’t evidence a functionalist, non-reductionist view; on the contrary, this could be the
patient methodological approach of a still classically reductionist view. Evidence
that classical reductionism is HSF’s view here is provided by how they reconceptualize what others call neural correlates of consciousness: “Conscious states are
not correlated with brain states; they are brain states” (p. 101). Further evidence
in this direction is provided by the countenancing by HSF that there is direct reference of mental state terms generally (pp. 125–126) to brain states. All of this

13

286

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

seemingly betokens a classically reductionist view on their part. While my own
metaphysics of mind agrees with them here, what HSF don’t do is deal with the
thought (shared by many) that such reductionism is by itself incompatible with
responsibility. There is a neuroscience-generated skepticism about responsibility
stemming from reductionism seemingly separate from the neuroscience-generated
skepticism stemming from determinism. This is the idea that being a mechanical
machine is inconsistent with being a morally responsible agent. Although HSF do
examine determinism in some detail, they do not similarly probe their physicalistic reductionism for its supposedly skeptical implications for responsibility.
My main disagreements with HSF lie in none of the three foregoing directions. Rather, these disagreements stem from yet another tenet on which, in general, HSF and I agree, and that is metaphysical compatibilism. Neither HSF nor
I believe that the causal accounts of human behavior that neuroscience produces
are incompatible with persons being morally responsible for their choices, their
actions, and their consequences. That belief makes all of us in some sense compatibilists. But the devil is in the details.

2  Killing Two Birds with One Stone: Using Compatibilism to Rebut
the Skeptic and to Guide Research into the Brain Functions
that Moral Agency Requires
HSF are right to spend the time they do on the fourth metaphysical issue that I mentioned above, that of compatibilism. Compatibilism is the metaphysical doctrine
that moral responsibility for a choice or an action is compatible with that choice or
that action being causally determined by factors over which the chooser/actor had
no control; responsibility, in other words, exists compatibly with determinism. HSF
give this more specific characterization of compatibilism generically:
[Compatibilists] largely reject the idea that responsibility hinges either on an
agent’s ability to do otherwise in a libertarian (“uncaused causer”) sense or
on an agent’s being the initial cause of the action, separate from other antecedent causes. Instead, on compatibilist accounts of responsibility, an agent’s
responsibility for an action generally reflects facts about the relationship of
the agent’s mind to his or her action. And these facts depend on whether the
agent had the right kinds of mental structures or capacities at the time he or
she acted, even if those structures or capacities function in a mechanistic or
deterministic way. (p. 47)
Notice that HSF rightly define compatibilism as having both a negative and a positive aspect. Compatibilism describes both what is not required for responsibility
(an “uncaused causer” or a primitive human agency that is unanalyzable in ordinary causal terms) and what is required for responsibility (“the right kinds of mental
structures or capacities”). The negative and positive aspects of compatibilism correspond to the two tasks of compatibilist philosophy in projects such as theirs: to
answer the skeptic about responsibility, and to guide analysis and research into what

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

287

brain structures and capacities are needed for a human being to be a morally responsible agent.
HSF forthrightly state their general commitments here: “we are compatibilists
about responsibility” (p. 75). About the negative theses of compatibilism HSF and
I have no disagreement. We both abhor the idea that responsibility depends on anything so ridiculous as the idea that we are literally gods, prima causa in Aquinas’
terms, the only items in the universe (other than god and the big bang) free of any
causal relations that would make our choices be effects of earlier causes but also free
to have those choices operate as causes; HSF and I also abhor the equally ridiculous
idea that our agency (but nothing else’s) requires a special, sui generis, primitive
agency that cannot be explicated in terms of ordinary causation. And we no doubt
agree that a neuroscience hell-bent on finding either lacuna of freedom or irreducible little agents within the otherwise deterministic system of the human brain is a
bootless and literally senseless enterprise (as was illustrated by the later work of
Eccles 1994).
All good so far; but looming large are the details of what kind of positive aspect
compatibilism should have. I shall explore those details in the following steps. First,
do HSF adopt the best taxonomy of the various kinds of compatibilism, and is what
they regard as the most successful account of compatibilism among the theories so
taxonomized, in truth, that successful? Second, even if one accepted the HSF taxonomy and even if one accepted HSF’s reasons-responsiveness account as the best
alternative within that taxonomy, is the “diachronic” version of reasons-responsiveness compatibilism (that HSF would add on to standard-issue reasons-responsiveness compatibilism) viable? Third, since the aim of the HSF project is to relate the
insights of neuroscience about executive functioning to the psychological characteristics a good compatibilism reveals to be presupposed by our responsibility assessments in the criminal law, do HSF devote enough attention to the folk psychology in
terms of which those psychological presuppositions are framed? Fourth, because the
HSF kind of compatibilism is framed in terms of the capacities of executive functioning, what is the HSF analysis of the crucial notion of a capacity (or “ability”)?
Fifth, what is the role of consciousness—and in what sense of “consciousness”—in
the capacities of executive functioning that HSF’s form of compatibilism regards as
crucial to responsibility?

3  Taxonomizing Compatibilisms and Choosing the Most Successful
Kind
HSF taxonomize compatibilisms between two kinds: “reason-responsiveness”
accounts and “real self” accounts. They plump for a reasons-responsiveness kind
of compatibilism and regard the real self account as their “primary competitor” (p.
52) within the family of compatibilist accounts. I agree with neither of these points:
I don’t think that reasons-responsiveness’ main competitor is the real self account,
and, once the right competitor is identified, I don’t think the reasons-responsiveness
account competes successfully with it. I consider each disagreement in turn.

13

288

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

Reasons-responsiveness compatibilism locates the seat of responsibility in the
source of actions by some human agent. If: (1) that source is a mechanism within the
agent that makes their behavior responsive to a sufficiently wide variety of reasons
people have for acting one way or another; (2) the varieties of behaviors so responsive together instantiate a pattern of behavior intelligible to us as the actions of a
person; (3) the responsiveness in question is only “moderate responsiveness,” meaning not that the actor could do other than they did if there were good enough reasons
to do so, but only that the actor would react to at least one sufficient reason to do
other than they did by taking that reason into account as they reasoned what to do;
and (4) the actor at some point in the past has taken responsibility for their reasonsresponsiveness mechanism in the sense that they saw (and now see) its outputs as
actions of their agency; if all of this is true, then that agent is morally responsible
for the harms that they cause (p. 47). This is a compatibilist account because having
such a source of actions in the reason-responding mechanism of an agent is compatible with that source being caused to do what it does by various environmental,
genetic, or neurological factors over which the agent has no control.
Real self compatibilism is presented by HSF as one, unified, kind of compatibilism but in reality they have amalgamated two views together here. The first view
is that of Frankfurt (1971). Frankfurt early on distinguished first order desires from
second order desires—desires about first order desires—and held that our real self
was to be found in the latter, specifically, in the desires we had about what we should
desire. The constellation of such second order desires constituted our view of what
kind of person we each wanted to be, or as Frankfurt later put it (Frankfurt 1984),
what desires we could “wholeheartedly endorse.” The second view owes more to
Aristotle and Hume than to Frankfurt. This is the view that the seat of responsibility is to be found in the character of the actor, so that actions proceeding from
such character—actions that are “in character” for that agent—are actions for which
the actor is responsible, whereas actions not so proceeding—actions that are “out of
character” for that agent—are actions where there is no such responsibility (Moore
1990). These two views are justifiably coalesced into one only on the dicey supposition that character is constituted exclusively by the phenomenology of its possessor
so that the sense of what character we do or should have determines the character we
actually possess.
Notice that all of these views—the reasons-responsiveness, the self-identification,
and the character views—locate the seat of responsibility in the source of actions.
For each of these views holds that if the actions have the right source—whether
in the reasons-responsiveness mechanism, wholeheartedly endorsing second order
desires, or character—then the actions are ones for which the actor can be held
responsible. The source of actions, not those actions’ supposed freedom from causation, is what grounds responsibility. Thus the name for all such views: “source
compatibilism” (McKenna and Coates 2019). As opposed to what? On my reading
of the history of twentieth-century philosophy, the compatibilism contrasting with
all source compatibilisms is some kind of conditionalist compatibilism, either the
“classical” compatibilism of Moore (1912) and his intellectual descendants or the
“new conditionalist” compatibilism of Smith (2004), Vihvelin (2013), and myself
(Moore 2020).

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

289

The watershed that divides source from conditionalist compatibilists can be found
in the Frankfurt (1969) kind of case mentioned by HSF (p. 48). Actor X is debating
whether to do some wrongful action A. An evil neuroscientist, Mr. Black, wants X
to do A and, to ensure that X does so, Black has inserted a device into X’s brain
such that it reads what X will choose; the device will also enable Black to change
X’s decision if Black doesn’t like what X has chosen. As it happens X chooses to do
A and because of such choice X does A, without Black having to activate his device.
It is intuitive to almost everyone, myself included, that X is morally responsible for
doing A. Source compatibilists like HSF say that this is because the right source
for A within X was present, even though X lacked the ability to do other than A
(because had X tried not to do A, Black would have intervened to make him do it).
Conditionalist compatibilists share with source compatibilists the bottomline intuition that in Frankfurt cases X is responsible for doing A, with the difference that, for them, X’s responsibility does not rest solely on X’s action A
being properly sourced. Unlike the source compatibilists, conditionalists require
that X could have chosen other than he did (“free will”) and that X could have
done other than he did (“free action”). And, according to conditionalists, X is
responsible for doing A because X had these abilities—that is, in the oft-quoted
language of the principle of alternative possibilities (“PAP”), X could have chosen and done other than he did. To arrive at this conclusion about X’s abilities
despite Black’s seemingly controlling presence, conditionalists analyze what X
could have done (ability) counterfactually in terms of what X would have done in
certain circumstances different from those that actually obtained when X acted.
Classical compatibilists such as G. E. Moore analyze, “X could not have done A,”
as, “X would not have done A if he had chosen not to do A”; new conditionalist
compatibilists substitute more complicated conditional antecedents to their counterfactuals. In both cases X is thought to have had the ability to choose and to do
other than A because Mr. Black did not in fact take away that ability by intervening. “Ability,” by this analysis, does not refer as much to facts about successful
future behavior as it does to inner dispositions and to the physical equipment that
realizes them, and X’s physical “ability-equipment” was intact unless and until
Mr. Black intervened.
The divide between source and conditionalist compatibilists is a significant
one. Donald Davidson charted this years ago in his flirtation with both of these
forms of compatibilism (Davidson 1973). By contrast, the differences between
the two (or three) kinds of source compatibilisms are of lesser moment. HSF perhaps implicitly acknowledge the former, major divide between compatibilisms,
for they explicitly put aside conditionalist analyses with their blunt conclusion
that “the ability to do otherwise is not necessary to responsible action” (p. 48). It
is perhaps because they so firmly believe that conclusion that they didn’t bother
taxonomizing compatibilism in the traditional way.
Yet the conclusion is false, irrespective of the fact that it has been widely
shared in the philosophy of the last 60 years (Moore 2020). Responsibility for
some wrongful action A requires more than that A be properly sourced within
certain structures and capacities of the agent (although it does require at least
that). In addition, responsibility also requires the kind of freedom that Hume

13

290

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

first charted: the freedom worth wanting, Hume taught us, is not that our wills
be uncaused, but rather, that our wills be able to cause the world to conform to
them, at least some of the time. Such freedom demands not only that certain processes and not others be the source of our actions; but it also requires that we
have the power—the ability, the capacity, the possibility—of choosing and doing
one thing rather than another. Charting the dimensions of such power will be to
chart out the domain of excused versus blameworthy action, which is supposed
to be the second payoff of any form of compatibilism. I would thus supplement
HSF’s source compatibilism with the kind of conditionalist analysis of PAP that
I and others have tendered in recent years. Doing so forces the neuroscience of
executive functions to answer all of the right questions pertinent to responsibility,
and not just some of them.

4  The Unhelpful Distraction of a “Diachronic” Kind of Compatibilism
HSF seek to bolster their reasons-responsiveness kind of source compatibilism
by moving from purely “synchronic” versions to what they call the “diachronic”
versions (pp. 49–52). What they mean is this: to take responsibility for one’s own
reasons-responsiveness mechanism (the fourth requirement for HSF above) takes
time; to achieve the needed sense that such mechanism is the source of one’s
actions, the agent cannot simply have such mechanism implanted (say, by 3 weeks
of coercive indoctrination in a closet, as was arguably the case with Patty Hearst).
Rather, such sense of ownership of a reasons-responsive mechanism must be
“cultivated over time by its possessor…” (p. 49). Such cultivation for HSF, as
for Roskies (2012) whom they cite, includes the doing of three kinds of activities
by which an agent cultivates their sense of themselves as an agent: engineering
the environment so as to make certain later choices by themselves more likely,
making commitments to overarching policies that will guide future decisions, and
doing self-control exercises to strengthen their disposition to engage in deliberative control (p. 51). HSF thus regard the sense of owning one’s self-control mechanism—of seeing that it constitutes one’s agency and controls one’s responsibility—as a kind of achievement that human beings can succeed or fail at.
Does this “diachronic” add-on to standard-issue “synchronic” reasons-responsiveness compatibilism strengthen this form of compatibilism? I don’t see how.
Imagine that some actor, Y, fails miserably at taking responsibility for her reasons-responsiveness mechanism, that is, she fails at the task of seeing herself as a
responsible agent. Suppose that Y in mature adulthood does some awful thing, A.
Is Y responsible for A? I think the intuitive answer is in the affirmative, the intuition being that we cannot escape responsibility for some later failure (like doing
A in adulthood) by pointing out some earlier failure of ours (such as not setting
the right policies for ourselves when we were younger). Yet HSF cannot give the
affirmative answer here, not in terms of a direct responsibility and not in terms
of a derived responsibility. Since on the diachronic version of reasons-responsiveness compatibilism responsibility depends on ownership of the self-control
mechanism at t-2 when A was done, Y cannot straightforwardly be responsible at

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

291

t-2 for A because she does not have that precondition of responsibility met. Can
Y be derivatively responsible for doing A at t-2, a derivative responsibility that
is derived from a responsibility Y has for her failures at t-1 to take responsibility
for her agency? I believe that HSF think that the answer to this question could
perhaps be, “yes.” For in cases of negligence, HSF hold actors responsible for
their t-2 failures to advert to some risk that they should have adverted to, because
those actors earlier failed at the three-fold tasks of agency construction (engineering of environments, setting of general policies, practicing decisions in exercises
strengthening of self-control) (pp. 69, 84, 208–209). Yet “yes” is not an available answer to HSF here, for two reasons: one, this is to use the objectionable
tracing strategy, a generally unfair and unsuccessful strategy (Hurd and Moore
2011; Vargas 2005); and two, Y cannot be blamable for her failures at t-1 any
more than she can at t-2 because at both times she lacks the ownership of agency
required for responsibility on the reasons-responsiveness account. (As to this second point, HSF do endow their actors responsible for negligence with a minimal
working set of executive functions, yet if these are enough for the ownership of
agency responsibility requires, and if one can have them without the three-fold
efforts HSF require, then earning the ownership of agency drops out as a requirement of responsibility.)
So HSF must hold that people like Y are not responsible for doing wrongful actions like A. HSF’s reluctance to say this no doubt is because they too find
it repugnant to deny responsibility in cases where the only reason for the denial is
because the actors failed not once but twice. Apart from this being counterintuitive pretty much on its face, to HSF no less than to the rest of us, there is also this
problem: how can the earlier failure be characterized as a moral failure? How can
one think that Y was morally obligated to engage in the task of building up one’s
sense of responsible agency, if the having of that sense of agency is a precondition
of being a responsible agent? In her “pre-agential” state isn’t Y beyond good and
evil, i.e., beyond the reach of moral obligation? If so, what reason does she have to
develop such sense of agency within herself? Yet without such reason, how is her
not doing so any kind of failure, moral or otherwise?

5  HSF’S Missing Link Between Law and Morality’s Requirements
of Responsibility, and Neuroscience’s Structures and Capacities
of Executive Functioning
HSF shares my general view of the right way to use compatibilism to guide the
search for morally relevant insights in neuroscience. One first specifies the major
components that the criminal law (and the ascriptive morality that underlies that
law) requires for a person to be punishably responsible for some bad state of affairs;
one’s compatibilism tells one not to think that any contra-causal free will need be
located in the brain (thank goodness, since there is none) and further informs one:
(a) as to what kinds of mental processes are required to be the right sort of source
for an action to be a responsible one; and (b) what sort of abilities to choose and to

13

292

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

do otherwise need be present for an action to be a responsible one. One then relates
those requirements of law and morality to what is needed in the way of brain equipment such that those requirements can be met in individual cases.
HSW and I further agree on the general shape of these requirements of responsible action in law and morality. There are three such requirements [which I describe
in my own vocabulary, not that of HSF (pp. 56–66)]: (1) Some actor X must have
performed some action A where A is both a moral wrong and a legally prohibited
action, or X must have failed to perform some action B where B is both a morally required and a legally required action that X had the ability to perform (the
requirement of “wrongdoing”); (2) X must have been culpable in the doing of A
or the not-doing of B (the requirement of “culpability”); and (3) X must have been
an accountable agent at the time they acted or failed to act (the requirement of
“accountability”).
HSW and I further agree on the kinds of brain structures and capacities that are
relevant to an agent meeting the three requirements of responsible action just mentioned, structures and capacities they label “executive functioning” (pp. 17–41).
What I see as an incompleteness in the HSF account, however, is much specification
of the tertium quid between the moral/legal requirements and the executive functions in the brain. That tertium quid consists of the mental states and processes that
constitute both the reasons-responsiveness mechanism and the ability to choose and
to do otherwise that a full-throated compatibilism demands. Needed, in other words,
is a map of the mental states and processes that constitute the practical rationality
of morally responsible agents who do acts for which they can justifiably be blamed.
My own take on this conceptual tertium quid I have detailed elsewhere (Moore
2020). Practical rationality involves certain relations (and not others) existing
between actors’ character (both long term and on an occasion), and their prima facie
and all-out factual beliefs, and their component desires and all-out wants, and their
prima facie and all-out evaluative beliefs (or “values”), and their choices and intentions, and their plans of which their discrete choices and intentions are constituents,
and their volitions (or willings or tryings) that execute such intentions, and their
bodily movements caused in the right way by such volitions and representations of
which are the Intentional objects of such volitions, and the real world consequences
of those bodily movements representations of which match the contents of actors’
beliefs, desires, evaluations, and intentions, and their states of psychological satisfaction at some of those consequences of action matching the desires that motivated
the action (often called states of “liking”). There are many mental state contributors
to the full practical rationality that makes us the accountable agents who are blamable when we culpably engage in wrongdoing. It would be helpful for HSF or others
to chart just how the executive functioning of the brain that they describe relates to
these more discrete requirements of practically rational agency.

6  HSF’S Missing Analysis of the Crucial Term in Both Source
and Conditionalist Compatibilism, Viz, Ability
The idea of ability (or capacity) lies at the heart of each of the three conditions
that HSF and I see as being crucial to responsibility for a bad state of affairs, viz,
accountability, wrongdoing, and culpability. This is evidenced by HSF’s regular use
of what an actor can or cannot do or stop from doing, what it is possible or not possible to do, what an actor is able to do or could have done, what an actor can control
versus what is uncontrollable, etc. Thus:
1. The minimal working set of executive functions (“MWSEF”) that constitutes the
heart of accountability for HSF requires a raft of volitional and cognitive capacities (pp. 57–61);
2. Positive wrongdoing (i.e., by action) requires that agents have the “possibility of
subjecting their actions to ‘top down’ or executive review” (p. 76); and negative
wrongdoing (i.e., by omission) requires that actors had the ability to prevent that
for which they are being held responsible (p. 69);
3. Prima facie culpability requires that the actor has the ability to plan (pp. 60, 69);
all-out culpability (i.e., prima facie culpability where there is no excuse) requires
that the actor not suffer from impaired abilities to inhibit their impulses or to
plan or intend (p. 69), impairments where the agent’s executive control functions
have not been “encumbered,” “hijacked,” been subjected to “pressure” (p. 69),
or, generally, where there is “psychological incapacity” (p. 74).
In short, HSF’s “executive theory of responsibility” (their name for the responsibility existing when these three requirements are met) rests centrally on the view that
the executive functions are to be thought of as “the set of abilities required to effortfully guide behavior towards a goal…” (p. 27, emphasis added).
This continuous use of “ability” is unremarkable. After all, any compatibilist
account of responsibility will regard ability as central. This is explicit, for example,
in HSF’s diachronic version of reasons-responsiveness compatibilism: as they say,
responsibility requires agents who “can exercise top-down diachronic agential control over mental processes and the way in which they generate action…. [W]e, as
human beings, can deliberately intervene in our future selves and thereby be responsible for who we are and our behavior” (p. 208). It is equally explicit in conditionalist compatibilism, where to be responsible for some action A we must have been
able to have chosen and done other than A. Slightly less directly, HSF’s form of
source compatibilism—reasons-responsiveness—also rests on the capacities agents
must have to be responsible. HSF’s earlier quoted general characterization of source
compatibilism makes the source of our actions crucial to agents being responsible
for them; yet the facts about such source “depend on whether the agent had the right
kinds of mental structures or capacities at the time he or she acted…” (p. 47). Or
again: source compatibilists see “responsibility as depending on cognitive capacities…” (p. 46).

13

294

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

Yet remarkably the central notion of ability—equivalently in this context, what
one can do, what one could have done, what was possible for one to do, what one
had the capacity to do, what one had the power to do, what one controlled, what one
had control over, what one was free to do or not do—remains an unanalyzed primitive in the book. One understands the authors’ reluctance to enter this conceptual
bramble patch; Gary Watson (with only slight exaggeration) once called the analysis
of ability “the hardest question in all of philosophy” (Watson 1975). As Watson also
said, while on the surface of everyday use of “ability” its meaning seems deceptively familiar and clear, the longer one looks at it the harder the question becomes.
HSF could join the powers primitivists (Molnar 2003; Mumford 2011) and just say
that ability is a primitive, hopefully one that “we know it when we see it” so that
we can make the needed discriminations. Yet that has the well-known and obvious
drawbacks of all such primitivisms.
Well known in the literature are counterfactual analyses of ability, translating
“A could have done differently” into “the actor would have done differently if C,”
where C is some change of the actual world in which the actor did what they did
(Maier 2014). The counterfactual analysis of ability is supported by the intuitive idea that all abilities have success conditions: if an actor can do A, then in
some conditions (call such conditions, “C”) the actor would succeed in doing A.
If Jones could have run a mile in under 4 min on some occasion when in fact he
didn’t, or if some bridge that collapsed at Minneapolis/St. Paul could have not
collapsed, then in some conditions C the runner would have run the sub-four minute mile, and in other conditions C, the I-35 bridge would have held.
The counterfactual analysis of ability commends itself to scientists generally,
and neuroscientists more particularly. For notice that on this account statements
of abilities and of disabilities become testable. One knows how to test what would
happen in some imagined possible world: one sets up experimental conditions in
the actual world that match as closely as possible the conditions imagined for
the possible world and then sees if the thing described by the consequent clause
of the counterfactual actually happens. With primitive “coulds,” by contrast, one
just hopes that one “knows it when you see it.”
The enormously tricky part is to frame the relevant counterfactuals that analyze any given ability. What is the right counterfactual with which to analyze the
statement of some track coach who says to his star runner, “You could have won
that race (which the runner in fact lost)?” In this case we know the consequent
clause: it has to do with winning rather than losing that race. But what about the
antecedent clause describing conditions C? C could be G.E. Moore’s classically
compatibilist counterfactual: “If you had chosen to win—in the sense of ‘chosen’
meaning, really set your mind on it and tried as hard as you could—you would
have won.” But C could equally well be a thousand other things that form the possible world that the coach is imagining: e.g., “if you’d kept your head down at the
start…,” or, “if you had lengthened your stride…,” or, “if that gust of wind hadn’t
hit you at the end…,” or, “if you hadn’t tired yourself out the night before…,” etc.
The fact that this analysis is difficult to come up with does not excuse omitting to make some effort to do so nonetheless. For without any analysis of ability, how does one distinguish two kinds of cases where some executive control

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

295

function does not operate: cases where it could have operated but didn’t, versus
cases where it didn’t operate because it could not have operated? E.g., consider
Anthony Rangel’s thesis (Hare et al. 2009) that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(“DSLPFC”) has to be active and modulate the signals coming from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (“vmPFC”) if a dieter who wants to eat chocolate cake
will resist successfully their urge to eat the cake. In a case where the subject
eats the cake and their vmPFC is active but their DSLPFC is not, is the subject
responsible for going off their diet? We need an analysis of ability that will allow
us to decide whether there is unexercised capacity (and thus responsibility) here
or whether the non-activation of the DSLPFC makes the actor unable to have
resisted the eating of the cake. Counterfactualists about ability have an answer
here: if the activation of the DSLPFC is identical to (or in some other way intimately connected to) whatever the antecedent of C is in the relevant counterfactual (such as firmness of choice or strength of desire), then in possible worlds
where C is true the DSLPFC will be activated (no major miracles are allowed in
constructing possible worlds under the Lewisian metric) and in such worlds the
actor would resist eating the cake (and so in this, the actual world, the actor could
have not eaten the cake). Whereas I don’t know how to proceed if I have no such
analysis of ability ready to hand.
Can science save the day by providing an empirical account of what an ability
is in terms of the details of the physical equipment that realizes the possession of
various abilities on particular occasions? In principle I think the answer to that question should be, “yes.” But that is only because I have adopted an analysis of ability—the counterfactual analysis—that makes it possible to correlate brain structures
and processes with the presence/absence of behaviorally identified abilities. Absent
an analysis of ability and thus a behavioral test for when one seems to have it, how
would one know what to look for in the brains of subjects to correlate with the presence/absence of the relevant abilities? HSF give a number of Nancy Andreasen-like,
“broken brain” characterizations of cases where abilities are lacking (Andreasen
1984): they speak of “brain damage,” “executive malfunction” (p. 86), “compromised operations” (p. 88), “executive disfunction” (p. 89), intending in all cases to
be separating out cases of excuse (lack of ability) from cases of responsible action
(presence of ability). Yet HSF are shooting in the dark here, using some pre-analyzed intuitive notion of ability. My guess is that they think that the (dis)abilities
of various brain structures translate directly into the (dis)abilities of whole persons
that are relevant to responsibility. Yet on the counterfactual analysis of ability such
automatic translation would not be justified: different abilities (say of the DSLPFC
and of the person whose DSLPFC this is) are analyzed by different counterfactuals,
tested for truth in different possible worlds, so there is no reason to think that necessarily if a person’s DSLPFC lacks an ability to modulate signals from the vmPFC
then the person must be unable to choose other than they did. (This may be true, but
it doesn’t have to be true.)
There is an analogy in the recent history of philosophy that might seem to make
room for HSF’s use of an unanalyzed notion of ability. I refer to the Goldman/Moore
treatment of deviant causal chains in the 1970s. Goldman and Moore gave no analysis of “right way causation” (between belief/desire/intention sets and behavior) to get

13

296

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

around deviant causal chains counterexamples to their similar but differing causal
theories of action. No such analysis of right way causation need be given, said Goldman and Moore, because science can safely be left to give the empirical parameters
of such kind of causation (Goldman 1970; history recounted in Moore 2020, appendix to ch. 3). Yet for deviant causal chains we had the “actish phenomenal feel”
that Penfield’s subjects reported, a feel that allowed those subjects to tell when they
acted versus when Penfield’s electrodes provoked bodily movement. Their reported
actish phenomenal feel could thus be used to guide the search for the “right way”
causation. This guidance we lack here.
It is true that new conditionalist compatibilists—all of us who are in this camp—
do make the physical equipment that underlies abilities of various kinds part of what
we refer to as ability; this is what allows us to say that in Frankfurt cases where Mr.
Black does not intervene (because the actor does what Black wants him to do but on
his own), there is the ability to do otherwise (and thus responsibility), such ability
being measured physically and not behaviorally (and so measured, not being taken
away unless and until Mr. Black actually does intervene). Can HSF use this concession? No, because unlike the conditionalists HSF have no behavioral test for ability
that allows them to isolate the physical realizers of abilities of various kinds. HSF
are in the position Moore and Goldman would have been in about right way causation in deviant causal chain cases if there had been no Penfield “actish phenomenal
feel” to guide the science in its search for correlations.

7  The Role of Consciousness in HSF’S Executive (Functioning) Theory
of Responsibility
HSF see themselves as being in competition with Neil Levy about the source of
actions needed by a successful source compatibilism, HSF finding that source exclusively in executive control functions and Levy allegedly finding it exclusively in
consciousness. To get a grip on whether there is a real competition here, or whether
there should be one here, we first need to be clear about the elusive meaning both of
“consciousness” and of a mental state being “conscious.” HSF rather idiosyncratically stipulate a distinction between the terms, “consciousness” and “awareness”
(pp. 109–110); more typical is Daniel Dennett’s equation of the two (Dennett 1969).
Regardless of the labels, there is in any case a traditional distinction that HSF see
themselves as adopting from Ned Block, although in truth the distinction antedates
Block in the work of both James and Freud. This is the distinction between phenomenal (or experiential) consciousness and dispositional (or “access”) consciousness.
The latter is often rendered as “privileged access” in the sense that the holder of a
mental state that is conscious in this dispositional sense is thought to have direct,
non-observational, non-inferential knowledge of it that outside observers do not
have (pp. 94–97).
HSF also address the arguably unrelated question of whether either form of consciousness is realized in the brain as a system-wide (“global”) function or as a brainarea specific (“local”) function; HSF tentatively identify phenomenal consciousness
as localized and dispositional consciousness as global (pp. 97–103). HSF also think

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2022) 16:283–298

297

there to be some kind of priority that phenomenal consciousness enjoys over access
consciousness; yet it is unclear whether this is a conceptual priority being claimed—
one being the primary sense or usage of the term—or whether this is an empirical
priority, such that the global functioning that is supposed to be access consciousness
does the background work allowing phenomenal consciousness to arise in the local
hot spots where it does.
I regard these last as side issues in coming to an understanding of HSF’s disagreement between themselves and Neil Levy, so let me get on to the main show. If one
were to construe Levy to be referring to phenomenal consciousness, and insofar as
one ventures the hypothesis that these phenomenal experiences are locally realized
in the brain, there could be a genuine empirical disagreement here, that between
HSF’s locus of responsibility being executive control functions and Levy’s placing
such locus in consciousness; for these are different brain areas (and perhaps different
neurotransmitters in those areas) that either are or are not the causes of the actions
and omissions for which we are responsible.
Yet is Levy fairly so construed? He (like Moore 1980, 1983, 1984) wants to use
consciousness to draw the line between processes that are “personal” (things a person does) and processes that, although they may necessarily underlie what a person does, are not themselves things a person does, what Dennett long ago called
“subpersonal.” This is to use consciousness to draw the boundaries of a self. This
is also to use “consciousness” in its dispositional sense, not its phenomenal sense.
So construed, Levy does not compete with HSF so much as supplement them. Levy
could and should agree with HSF that executive control functioning is necessary
to responsibility, but then add that so is dispositional awareness; executive control
functioning where there is no privileged access to the processes of that functioning—such as the mechanisms of balance adjustment of the upright human body—
are not things persons do or for which they can be held responsible (except perhaps
on a diachronic, tracing basis). What a person does (and is thus responsible for) thus
does indeed depend on executive control functioning but only insofar as that functioning is accessible directly, i.e., is “conscious” in the dispositional sense of the
word. I am not sure that HSF need (or, indeed, do) disagree with Levy if he is so
construed.

8  Conclusion
Let me return to where I began. The most important thing to understand in relating
neuroscience both to criminal law and to the morality that underlies it is that neuroscience is not the harbinger of revolution in either our sense of justice or in our justice-oriented legal institutions. It should rather be seen as the ally and the helper of
the normative disciplines in the way that all good science is their ally and potential
helper. Neuroscience can deepen our understanding of when persons are responsible
and what enables them to be the responsible creatures that they are, and such science can precisify our tests of responsible action. Books such as HSF’s Responsible
Brains are invaluable in showing how and where such aids can be forthcoming from

13

neuroscience. The disagreements that I have explored in this short comment are trifling when compared to the major virtues of their book in this dimension.

Abstract
Michael S. Moore defends the ideas of free will and responsibility, especially in
relation to criminal law, against several challenges from neuroscience. I agree with
Moore that morality and the law presuppose a commonsense understanding of
humans as rational agents, who make choices and act for reasons, and that to defend
moral and legal responsibility, we must show that this commonsense understanding
remains viable. Unlike Moore, however, I do not think that classical compatibilism,
which is based on a conditional understanding of the ability to do otherwise, provides a sufficiently robust account of free will, even when it is amended as Moore
suggests. I argue that free will and responsibility can be defended more robustly
by observing that, at the level of agency, there can be alternative possibilities and
mental causation in a stronger sense than recognized by classical compatibilism,
even if physical determinism is true. Moore’s arguments could thus be strengthened
by embracing this compatibilist libertarian position. At the same time, I note that,
although the idea of responsibility is robustly defensible, there are independent reasons for rejecting a retributivist approach to punishment.

1 Introduction
The significance of neuroscience for the law has recently received much attention.
There is a growing chorus of voices arguing that the neuroscientific image of human
beings, especially its account of the relationship between the brain and behaviour,
dramatically challenges the ideas of free will and responsibility that are central not
just to everyday morality but also to the law. The following quotes from the neuroscientist David Eagleman eloquently express the challenge:

“So who is in control? Are you the captain of your own boat, or do your decisions and actions have more to do with massive neural machinery operating
out of sight? Does the quality of your everyday life have to do with your good
decision making, or instead with dense jungles of neurons and steady hum
of innumerable chemical transmissions? … [T]he conscious you is only the
smallest part of the activity of your brain. Your actions, your beliefs and your
biases are all driven by networks in your brain to which you have no conscious
access.”
“There really is no free will; when you arrive at that fork in the road, your
choice is predetermined. … [O]ur lives are steered by forces far beyond our
capacity for awareness and control.”1
One of the lessons, supposedly, is that:
“Criminals should always be treated as incapable of having acted otherwise.”2
If this is right, then both morality and the law are mistaken in assuming that people
are responsible for their actions. It is our brains and the underlying physical and
biological processes that make us do what we do, not our conscious decisions. Neuroscience, so the argument goes, undermines the assumption that people have the
sort of control over their actions that is needed for holding them responsible. And
therefore, the entire criminal-justice system, with its traditional emphasis on responsibility and its retributivist orientation, stands on shaky ground. If criminals are not
responsible for their actions, they do not plausibly deserve to be punished.
In his recent book, Mechanical Choices, Michael S. Moore confronts this challenge head-on and offers an ambitious defence of the ideas of free will and responsibility against the neuroscientific criticism, especially in relation to criminal law.3
He not only provides a detailed characterization and taxonomy of the relevant neuroscientific arguments but also makes a case for upholding the commonsense understanding of human beings as rational decision-makers who can be held responsible
for their actions. As summarized in the book’s abstract, “the book seeks to blunt
[the] radical challenges [from neuroscience] while nonetheless detailing how law,
morality, and common-sense psychology can harness the insights of an advancing
neuroscience to more accurately assign moral blame and legal punishment to the
truly deserving”.4
My aim in this paper is to offer a constructive critique of Moore’s position. My
critique is constructive, insofar as I broadly agree with Moore’s characterization
of the neuroscientific challenges and with his claim that, to defend moral and legal
responsibility, we must show that the commonsense understanding of humans as
rational agents who make choices and act for reasons remains viable. My critique is
nonetheless critical, insofar as I do not think that the sort of classical compatibilism

that Moore endorses provides a sufficiently robust account of free will. Moreover,
regardless of whether a robust account of free will is available, I do not follow
Moore in accepting a retributivist approach to punishment.
In short, I make a positive point and a negative one. My positive point is that
free will and responsibility can be defended more robustly, by recognizing that, even
if physical determinism is true, agents can have alternative possibilities and causal
control over their actions in a stronger sense than the conditional one accepted by
Moore. Thus I suggest that Moore’s defence of free will and responsibility could
be strengthened by embracing this so-called “compatibilist libertarian” position.5
My negative point, however, is that, despite the availability of a robust defence of
free will and responsibility, there are still good independent reasons for giving up
a retributivist approach to punishment and replacing it with an approach that puts
more emphasis on restorative justice.

2  The Neuroscientific Challenges for Free Will and Responsibility
Moore distinguishes between four challenges that neuroscience poses for free will
and moral and legal responsibility.6 First, the challenge from determinism consists
in the claim, allegedly supported by neuroscience’s mechanistic picture of human
beings, that everything we do is predetermined by prior physical states, especially
physical states of the brain and body. Second, the challenge from epiphenomenalism consists in the claim, associated with Benjamin Libet’s famous experiments on
the neural causes of voluntary movements, that our conscious choices are not the
causes of our actions but that they are mere epiphenomena. The real causes, so it
is suggested, are physical events in the brain, such as neuronal readiness potentials,
which trigger the conscious experience of choice-making as a byproduct. Third, the
challenge from reductionism consists in the claim, often made by neuroscientifically
inspired philosophers, that we as agents are, at bottom, nothing more than heaps
of molecules and neurons, with the implication that the folk-psychological picture
of humans as responsible agents is mistaken. Fourth, the challenge from fallibilism, allegedly prompted by our growing understanding of the neural underpinnings
of human psychology, consists in the claim that we lack the sort of introspective
knowledge of, and access to, our own minds that would be needed for genuinely
responsible choices. If neuroscience does indeed support all four claims, this speaks
against the conventional picture of humans as responsible agents with free will.
I think this taxonomy of the neuroscientific challenges for free will is useful, and
I agree with Moore that, to defend the idea of responsibility in the criminal law,
we must find some way of answering those challenges. Indeed, my own defence of
free will takes as its point of departure a very similar set of challenges, which differs from Moore’s (if we set aside nuances) only in omitting the last challenge.7 I

also agree with Moore that, even though some earlier versions of those challenges
had already been formulated well before the advent of modern neuroscience, the
neuroscientific versions of the challenges are particularly serious since they rest on
stronger scientific foundations than many of their precursors. For instance, Freudian psychoanalysis might be thought to challenge free will too, but Freudian psychoanalysis is much more controversial from a scientific perspective than modern
neuroscience. Finally, there is a fair amount of common ground between Moore and
myself with respect to some of the things that might be said in response to the challenges. Yet, I will here critically discuss Moore’s answer to the most widely discussed challenge: the one from determinism.
Moore frames this challenge in terms of a trilemma, which I will restate in
slightly modified form.8 The trilemma consists in the fact that there appears to be
a conflict between three theses that we might expect an account of free will and
responsibility to respect:
Physical determinism: Human behaviour takes place against the background
of physical determinism, which also underpins the functioning of the brain.
Openness of choices: A necessary condition for free will and moral responsibility is that choices are open, in the sense that their outcomes are not yet settled before those choices are made.
Realism about free will: Free will and moral responsibility are real properties, not just fictions or erroneous ascriptions.
To see the apparent conflict, note that if human behaviour takes places against the
background of physical determinism, there appears to be no room for the openness
of choices: their outcomes seem predetermined well before those choices are made.
But if such openness is necessary for free will and moral responsibility, then free
will and moral responsibility cannot be real properties.
It seems to follow that any account of free will and responsibility must reject
one of the three theses, and the proponents of any such view must justify why this
is acceptable. The disagreement between libertarians, compatibilists, and fictionalists, as Moore presents the debate, lies in which thesis to give up. Let us briefly run
through the three responses:
• Libertarians reject the thesis of physical determinism, and they can then uphold

the theses that the openness of choices is needed for free will and that, because
there truly is such openness, free will and moral responsibility are real properties. The cost of this view is that the rejection of physical determinism may go
against what science in general and neuroscience in particular appear (on some
interpretations) to teach us about the physical underpinnings of human behaviour.
• Compatibilists, as Moore characterizes them, reject the thesis that the openness
of choices is needed for free will and responsibility and replace it with a weaker
compatibilist account of what it takes for someone’s choices to count as “free”
8

See Moore (2020, ch. 8).

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

113

and “responsible”. The cost of such a view is that it apparently waters down the
notions of free will and moral responsibility, possibly below the bar of what is
needed to justify our conventional approaches to criminal justice.
• Fictionalists reject the thesis that free will and moral responsibility are real properties and instead hold that they are merely convenient fictions. We may speak as
if we have free will and moral responsibility, and this way of speaking is useful,
but we should not interpret it literally. A moral radical version of this view would
be an “error theory”, according to which our talk of free will and moral responsibility is intended to be literally true but rests on a systematic error, just as moral
discourse rests on a systematic error according to the error theory in metaethics.
The cost of any such view is that it entails that the criminal law is based on a
massive fiction or error.
It is worth mentioning that, in Moore’s own exposition of the trilemma, the second thesis differs from the one I have used here. Instead of referring to the “openness
of choices”, Moore formulates the thesis in terms of a requirement of “contra-causal
freedom”. In his wording, the second thesis asserts that “contra-causal freedom is
demanded for moral responsibility”.9 The reason I prefer the language of “openness”
(instead of “contra-causal freedom”) is that I would like the second thesis to be one
that all libertarians can accept, and Moore’s wording, unlike mine, seems to exclude
some variants of libertarianism.10 While all libertarians appear to agree that some
form of openness of one’s choices is needed for free will and moral responsibility,
not all libertarians will accept that this openness is “contra-causal”. For example,
naturalistically inclined libertarians, such as Robert Kane, will presumably want to
avoid any violations of the laws of nature or of any causal constraints in their picture
of free will, and they will instead look for the sources of openness inside those laws,
for instance by relating the relevant openness to quantum indeterminacies in the
brain.11 Also, agent-causal libertarians will want to say that free choices involve a
special form of agent causation, where the act of choice itself initiates a new causal
chain, rather than being somehow “contra-causal”.12 But even if this could be rendered consistent with what Moore means by “contra-causal freedom”, I think the
wording of “openness” is more inclusive.
At any rate, if neuroscience supports the first thesis (physical determinism), our
commonsense picture of free agency and responsibility supports the second thesis
(openness of choices), and morality and the criminal law presuppose the third thesis
(realism about free will), we have a significant problem. What to say in response
will be the topic of the next section.

3  Moore’s Classical Compatibilism
If, as Moore does, we accept the scientific support for physical determinism and a
mechanistic functioning of the brain as independently given (which, for the sake of
argument, I won’t question here), and we also follow Moore in considering a fictionalist or error-theoretic account of free will unsatisfactory, especially from the perspective of the criminal law, we must grant the theses of determinism and realism,
and it looks as if we must reject the thesis of openness of choices. Indeed, this is the
thesis Moore rejects. To be precise, he rejects the version of that thesis formulated in
terms of “contra-causal freedom”. Essentially, his account of free will is a classical
compatibilist one, inspired by G. E. Moore’s conditional analysis of the ability to do
otherwise.13
According to such an account, free will does require the ability to do otherwise,
that is, an agent’s action counts as free only if the agent could have acted otherwise,
but this ability is understood in conditional terms. “The agent could have acted otherwise” is interpreted to mean:
(C) If the agent had tried or wanted to act otherwise, he/she would have succeeded.
As already observed by G. E. Moore, the ability to act otherwise then becomes
compatible with determinism. It can be true in a deterministic world that, in the
nearest possible world(s) in which the agent had tried or wanted to act otherwise,
he or she would have succeeded, which is all that is needed for the truth of (C). In
particular, the conditional can be true even if in the actual world the agent was never
going to try or want to act otherwise. So, conditional (C) offers a determinismfriendly analysis of the ability to act otherwise. As G. E. Moore wrote,
“[O]ur theory does not assert that any agent ever could have chosen any other
action than the one he actually performed. It only asserts, that, in the case of
all voluntary actions, he could have acted differently, if he had chosen: not that
he could have made the choice.”14
Michael Moore recognizes that, despite the initial appeal of this conditional analysis, there are a number of powerful objections suggesting that the analysis does not
fully capture the ordinary meaning of ability ascriptions. Most notably, conditional
(C) can be true even when there are psychological or physical barriers preventing
the agent from trying or wanting to act otherwise. The claim that the agent had the
ability to act otherwise seems implausible in such a case. Think of a drug addict
whose addiction is so powerful that trying not to give in to his addiction is simply
too hard. It may be true that if this agent tried to act otherwise, he would succeed,
but the “if”-clause is too big an “if”. Many compatibilists have therefore chosen to
abandon the conditional analysis in favour of a dispositional analysis, according to
which to say that an agent could have acted otherwise is to say that:
13
14

See Moore (1912).
See ibid., p. 12.

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

115

(D) The agent has a (suitably defined) disposition to act otherwise in (suitably
defined) relevant circumstances.15
Michael Moore, however, does not find the arguments for a dispositional analysis convincing and instead upholds the conditional analysis, albeit with some
amendments. Specifically, he proposes to replace conditional (C) with a pair of
conditionals16:
(Caction) If the agent had chosen to act otherwise, he/she would have acted otherwise.
(Cchoice) If the agent had wanted to do so badly enough, he/she would have
chosen to act otherwise.
The first of these conditionals is intended to capture the ability to act otherwise;
the second is intended to capture the ability to choose otherwise. For Moore, the
conjunction of the two conditionals is required for free will. This is meant to address
the sort of objection mentioned earlier, namely that, if we focus on only a single
conditional such as (C), an agent could count as free even when there are psychological or physical barriers preventing him or her from choosing to act otherwise. In
such a case, Moore suggests, the second conditional, namely ­(Cchoice), is false, even
if the first conditional, namely (­Caction), is true, and so the amended analysis can
avoid the objection.
Similarly, the use of the two conditionals gives Moore some resources to avoid
the tendency of the classical conditional analysis to over-ascribe abilities where
there are none. As noted, the classical analysis ascribes the ability to do otherwise even to a drug addict acting under to the constraints of his or her addiction or
someone suffering from severe psychological compulsion, even though it is hard or
impossible for the person to choose to act otherwise. Ordinarily, we think that the
person did not act out of their own free will and had a valid excuse for doing what
they did. Moore’s idea, presumably, is that the second conditional is false in such a
case: it is not true that if the agent had wanted to do so badly enough, he/she would
have chosen to act otherwise. If this is right, Moore’s amended analysis avoids the
over-ascription of an ability to do otherwise to the person in question.
Moore’s analysis departs from the classical conditional analysis of abilities in a
further respect. He takes the relevant pair of conditionals to be merely a test for the
ability to act otherwise, not as the defining condition. This is meant to address the
worry that, in so-called “finkish” worlds, where abilities disappear whenever we are
trying to test for them, the conditionals might not correctly express the truth-conditions for ability statements. And so, the conditionals are inadequate as general defining conditions for the ability to act otherwise. Since “finkish” worlds are very contrived and apparently only relevant to philosophical thought experiments, however, I

This definition is based on Fara (2008). For critical discussions of the dispositional analysis of the
ability to do otherwise, see, e.g., Clarke (2009) and Whittle (2010).

will here concede that having a test for abilities that is accurate in non-finkish worlds
is good enough.
Moore also considers a version of the two conditionals in which the consequent
clause is formulated using the word “could” instead of “would”, i.e.,
• “One could have acted otherwise” means “if one had chosen to act otherwise,

one could have acted otherwise”, and

• “One could have chosen to act otherwise” means “if one had wanted to do so

badly enough, one could have chosen to act otherwise”.

However, I consider this version of the conditionals a non-starter because it generates a regress. If the conditional formulation is meant to be a substitute for the
original “could” statement, then it remains unclear how we should interpret the word
“could” inside those conditionals, where the original “could” statement reappears as
the consequent. Therefore, I will set this version of the conditionals aside and will
continue to treat ­(Caction) and ­(Cchoice) with the word “would” rather than “could” as
the correct version of Moore’s conditionals.

4  Why Moore’s Compatibilism is Insufficient for Moore’s Purposes
For the sake of argument, I will concede that Moore’s pair of conditionals ­(Caction)
and ­(Cchoice) constitutes an improvement over the classical conditional analysis of
the ability to do otherwise, in particular when Moore’s proposal is understood as a
test for the ability to choose and act to do otherwise, where the test is intended for
non-finkish worlds.
Nonetheless, I will now argue that Moore’s version of the conditional analysis
falls short as a condition for free will and responsibility, even if we focus just on the
“could have done otherwise” requirement for responsibility while setting aside other
requirements, such as intentionality or mental causation. This is especially so when
the goal, as in Moore’s project, is to ground what is sometimes called “basic desert
moral responsibility”, “the sense [of responsibility] that would make us truly deserving of praise and blame, punishment and reward”, to use Gregg Caruso’s words.17
The reason, quite simply, is that, on the commonsense understanding of human
agency on which ideas of criminal justice are traditionally based, a necessary condition for an agent to count as responsible for something he or she did is that it wasn’t
impossible for this agent to do otherwise. If it was impossible for the agent to do
otherwise, the agent cannot plausibly be blamed, let alone punished, for doing what
he or she did.
This impossibility, however, is far from excluded by the conditionals (­ Caction) and
­(Cchoice) but remains entirely consistent with them. That is, the conditionals ­(Caction)
and ­(Cchoice) can come out as true even when doing otherwise would have been
strictly impossible for the agent. In such a case, the truth of ­(Caction) and ­(Cchoice)
17

See Caruso (2020), emphasis original.

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

117

doesn’t license the kind of responsibility ascription that a proponent of a retributivist
approach to punishment such as Moore would need to rely on.
To see that ­(Caction) and (­Cchoice) are jointly consistent with the impossibility of
doing otherwise, note that, on the standard semantics for conditionals (familiar, for
instance, from David Lewis’s and Robert Stalnaker’s works), a conditional such as
“If P were the case, then Q would be the case” is true in the actual world if and only
if its consequent Q is true in all nearest possible worlds in which its antecedent P is
true.18 Thus, for ­(Caction) and ­(Cchoice) to be true in the actual world, it must be the
case that:
• In the nearest possible worlds in which the agent chose to act otherwise, he/she

did in fact act otherwise; and

• In the nearest possible worlds in which the agent wanted to do so badly enough,

he/she did in fact choose to act otherwise.

Crucially, both of these statements can be true even if the “nearest possible
worlds” in question are intuitively very remote. For instance, under the assumption
of determinism, the nearest possible worlds in which the agent wanted to choose
to act otherwise could be ones in which the initial conditions of the universe—say,
at the time of the Big Bang—were different from what they actually were, or they
could be ones in which the laws of nature were breached at some earlier point in
time, so as to put the agent on a different trajectory from the one on which he or she
was actually embarked. In particular, it is not a necessary condition for the truth of
either of the bulleted statements that the nearest possible worlds in question were
accessible from the actual world at some time in the past. And so, Moore’s two conditionals could come out as true even if the scenarios described by their antecedents
were historically inaccessible in the actual world. To insist that we should nonetheless say that the agent could have acted otherwise is at best counterintuitive, at worst
simply mistaken.19
Might one claim that the two conditionals couldn’t both be true if choosing to act
otherwise or trying to make that choice had been genuinely impossible? In particular, might it help to argue that, in such case, there would not be any nearest possible
world in which the agent chose to act otherwise or one in which the agent wanted to
do so badly enough? Unfortunately, this response wouldn’t help at all. If there were
no nearest possible worlds in which the agent chose to act otherwise or wanted to
make that choice, the two bulleted statements would be vacuously true: if there are
no possible worlds at all in which P is true, then any consequent clause Q is vacuously true in any such world.

18

See Lewis (1973) and Robert (1968).
Compatibilists in the tradition of G.E. Moore are likely to disagree with me here and argue that the
compatibility of the relevant conditionals with the impossibility of doing otherwise is a feature of their
account, not a bug. I am presenting what I regard as a commonsense objection to this form of compatibilism. I recognize that the objection relies on incompatibilist intuitions (which, however, may be pretheoretically widely shared).
19

13

118

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

The bottom line is that ­(Caction) and ­(Cchoice) can both be true even if, in the actual
world,
• It was impossible for the agent to act otherwise,
• It was impossible for the agent to choose to act otherwise,
• It was impossible for the agent to want to choose to act otherwise.

It then seems implausible to claim that the agent could bear moral and legal
responsibility for doing what he or she did, especially in the sense of “basic desert
moral responsibility”. I conclude, consistently with what responsibility sceptics such
as Gregg Caruso and Derk Pereboom have argued more generally, that the sort of
classical compatibilism that Moore endorses is too weak as a basis for the retributivist understanding of responsibility that Moore wishes to uphold.20

5  A More Robust Defence of Free Will and Responsibility
The foregoing considerations suggest that, if we wish to defend free will in a sense
that vindicates our ordinary practices of assigning moral and legal responsibility, we
must overcome the limitations of classical compatibilism. If we accept that an agent
can be responsible only in cases in which it was possible for him or her to act otherwise, then defending the ability to do otherwise in a merely conditional sense isn’t
enough. As Susan Hurley noted:
“[T]he ability to do otherwise entails the outright possibility of acting otherwise: it entails that there is a causal possibility of acting otherwise, holding all
else constant. A counterfactually conditioned disposition to act otherwise is
not the same thing as an outright possibility of acting otherwise.”21
If we go back to the trilemma discussed above, it seems that we cannot defend the
ability to do otherwise in the required robust sense unless we retain the thesis of the
openness of choices, which, as readers will recall, is the following:
Openness of choices: A necessary condition for free will and moral responsibility is that choices are open, in the sense that their outcomes are not yet settled before those choices are made.
But if we consider realism about free will and moral responsibility non-negotiable, it seems that we cannot retain this openness thesis in the face of the scientific
support for physical determinism. This was precisely the trilemma we began with.
I will now explain, however, that, contrary to first appearances, the theses of
physical determinism, openness of choices, and realism about free will are mutually consistent after all: free will in a relatively robust sense does in fact fit into

the worldview given to us by the sciences in general and neuroscience in particular.
Specifically, I will suggest that science supports the claim that humans have free
will in a recognizably libertarian sense, albeit one that—surprisingly—turns out to
be compatible with physical determinism. Free will, in the sense to be defended,
involves three things22:
Intentional agency: Any bearer of free will is an intentional agent: an entity
with beliefs, desires, and intentions who interacts with his or her environment
in a more or less intelligible, goal-directed manner.
Alternative possibilities: Any bearer of free will faces choices between different courses of action, each of which constitutes a possibility for this agent.
Mental causation: Any bearer of free will has causal control over his or her
actions, in the sense that what the agent does is caused by his or her relevant
intentional mental states, not merely by some sub-intentional states of the
brain and body.
For the purposes of my argument, I will take these three conditions to be jointly
necessary and sufficient for free will. Their wording could of course be fine-tuned,
but for now I will treat the conditions as sufficiently intelligible, and their meaning—
especially that of alternative possibilities—will become clearer in what follows.
The first thing I want to note is that the neuroscientific challenges for free will are
based on a fairly reductionistic view of human beings and their behaviour. Those challenges depict human beings essentially as biophysical systems, in which physical, chemical, and biological processes in the brain and body take centre stage. The challenge from
determinism consists in the fact that, from such a low-level perspective, human organisms may be governed by deterministic physical laws such that, conditional on the precise
physical microstate at any point in time, there is only one possible future series of physical states, which seems to preclude the existence of alternative possibilities. Similarly, the
challenges from epiphenomenalism and reductionism consist in the fact that, from a lowlevel perspective, there appears to be no room for mental causation or even for genuine
intentional agency itself. Rather, there appear to be just physical and chemical processes
in the brain and body, which neuroscience increasingly helps us to understand. If this is
the lens through which we look at human beings and their behaviour, then it is no surprise
that we find no support for free will and free action, or even for intentional agency itself.
But despite the insights that neuroscience has given us, its reductionistic approach
is appropriate only for some explanatory purposes, such as when we seek to explain
the low-level neural implementation mechanisms of human cognitive capacities.
For other purposes, such as when we want to explain what humans can and cannot
do and why they choose to do one thing rather than another, a non-reductionistic,
higher-level approach is needed. What I want to argue is this23:

22

I here draw on my book (List 2019).
My argument here is based on List (2014, 2019). The present exposition of the indispensability argument is most similar to the one in List (2022).

23

13

120

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

Claim 1: In many domains of the human and social sciences, it is explanatorily indispensable to depict humans as choice-making agents with free will,
i.e., to postulate that they are intentional agents, with alternative possibilities
to choose from, and mental causation.
And further:
Claim 2: This postulate is consistent with the rest of science.
Suppose, in addition, we rely on the following familiar principle from the philosophy of science24:
The naturalistic ontological attitude: Whenever postulating some property
or entity is explanatorily indispensable in some domain and this postulate is
consistent with the rest of science, we are warranted in taking a realist attitude
towards that postulate. (Here, the “warrant” is the ordinary scientific one, akin
to the warrant we have for believing that electrons, gravity, and electromagnetism are real.)
Then we can conclude this:
Conclusion: We are warranted in taking a realist attitude towards the depiction
of humans as choice-making agents with free will.
I now want to explain why we should accept the key premises of this argument,
namely Claims 1 and 2. That is, I want to explain why ascribing intentional agency,
alternative possibilities, and mental causation to people is indispensable for many
explanatory purposes, and why this ascription does not conflict with the rest of science. Given space constraints, I will focus on intentional agency and alternative possibilities and omit mental causation. Further details, as well as a discussion of mental causation, can be found in my recent book.25
Let me begin with the explanatory indispensability of postulating intentional
agency. Think about how the sciences of human behaviour explain phenomena ranging from market transactions and voting behaviour to cultural rituals and everyday
social interactions. If we sought to explain those phenomena by viewing people as
nothing but biophysical systems—heaps of interacting cells—we wouldn’t know
where to begin. As noted, neuroscience might shed some light on the physiological mechanisms by which higher-level cognitive capacities are implemented in the
brain. However, without identifying the meaningful, intentional nature of the activities involved in the mentioned phenomena, we have no hope of giving an adequate
account of them. The sciences of human behaviour recognize this and explain all the
given phenomena by depicting people as intentional agents, with beliefs and desires,
goals and plans, on the basis of which they choose their actions.
Of course, disciplines ranging from anthropology and psychology to economics and sociology differ significantly in their methods and approaches, and scholars

24
25

See Quine (1977) and Fine (1984).
See List (2019). My exposition here further draws on List (2022).

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

121

in those disciplines disagree about the precise nature of intentional agency. For
instance, they disagree about how much rationality we should ascribe to intentional
agents and how we should conceptualize “rationality”. Nevertheless, the general
presupposition that human beings are intentional agents is central to all the disciplines in question, for good scientific reasons. As Daniel Dennett already noted in
his classic work on the “intentional stance”, viewing people as mere physical organisms would be unilluminating for many purposes, and viewing them as intentional
agents is essential.26 So far, this is a widely accepted point.
Now, once we recognize the explanatory indispensability of postulating intentional agency, it also becomes evident that this postulate must be accompanied by
a postulate of alternative possibilities. To see this, consider some illustrative questions addressed by intentional explanations in the human and social sciences. Why
does someone who has made an appointment usually show up? Why does someone
vote for one political party rather than another? Why do consumers respond to price
changes? Why do people at least sometimes behave morally? Whenever we answer
such questions, I suggest, we either explicitly or implicitly rely on the following
three-part hypothesis.27
Explanatory hypothesis: The agent
(1) Has some options, which are his or her possible choices,
(2) Deliberates about, or at least cognitively processes, those options (which can
take any form ranging from slow and rational to fast and spontaneous), and then
(3) Chooses one option among the possible ones, in a way that is more or less supported by the agent’s mental state.
For instance, we cannot give a good explanation of why a particular person is
showing up for an appointment without attributing to that person the choice between
showing up and not showing up and identifying the reasons as to why the person is
making the choice she does. Similarly, we cannot explain why a person is casting
his vote for a populist party without attributing to that person a choice in the first
place. Without the assumption that the person is making a choice, we would not be
able to explain why he ends up choosing one thing over another. The same is true
for the other illustrative questions, concerning responses to price changes and moral
behaviour. In all these cases, the explanatory strategy involves pointing to the fact
that the relevant agent chooses one option rather than another and that this choice is
somehow supported by the agent’s mental state.
The key presupposition is that any agent in question sometimes has alternative
possibilities to choose from. Or in other words:
Key presupposition: At any given choice node, the agent’s trajectory admits
different “agentially possible” continuations, one such continuation for each
option that the agent could possibly choose.
26
27

See Dennett (1987).
I have previously made this point, for instance, in my response to critics in List (2020).

13

122

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

I call this thesis “agential indeterminism”. The thesis suggests that, as people go
about their activities, they take some path through an extensive-form decision tree,
as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The dots represent choice nodes, and the branches, moving upwards from the root
of the tree, represent possible trajectories the agent may take. Even if a given theory
of human behaviour singles out one of these trajectories as the predicted one, which
the theory says the agent will rationally take (say, the highlighted one), all the other
trajectories are deemed possible too. In this sense, any such explanatory theory presupposes what I have called “agential indeterminism”: the availability of alternative
possibilities for the agent. Thus, our theories of human behaviour are, in effect, committed to the thesis of the openness of choices that libertarians defend and Moore
gives up.
However, even if I am right that postulating intentional agency and alternative
possibilities (as well as mental causation) is explanatorily indispensable in the
human and social sciences, readers might still worry that this is insufficient to justify a realist attitude towards those properties—and by implication, towards free
will—because the relevant postulates might still conflict with the rest of our scientific worldview. In particular, the postulate of alternative possibilities may be at odds
with what neuroscience has taught us about the physical determinism underpinning
the functioning of the brain. For this reason, that postulate can, at best, be an explanatorily useful fiction. In the next section, I will respond to this worry.

6  Why Agential Indeterminism is Compatible with Physical
Determinism
I want to explain why physical determinism does not rule out agential indeterminism.28 At first sight, one might think that if a system behaves deterministically at
some underlying level, say, the level of physical processes in the brain and body,
then the system’s behaviour must be deterministic across the board, irrespective of
whether we are focusing on the system’s low-level or high-level properties. But this
initially plausible thought can be shown to be mistaken.
First of all, we must note that many systems admit more than one level of description. At different levels, we use different concepts and categories to speak about
such a system’s behaviour, and we represent the system’s states in a more or less
fine-grained manner. Think of the Earth’s atmosphere, for example. We can think of
it as a microphysical system in which there are gazillions of air molecules each of
which behaves in a deterministic way according to the laws of classical physics. Or
we can think of it as a macroscopic system in which certain macro-variables stand in
probabilistic relations to one another: a higher temperature, for instance, raises the
probability of a thunderstorm. For different explanatory purposes, different descriptions may be more or less appropriate, and they draw our attention to different properties of the system: low-level properties in one case and high-level properties in
28

My argument here is based on List (2014).

123

another. It’s not the case that low-level properties are real and high-level properties
fictional, but they are each real, albeit level-specific.
The crucial point, now, is that a system’s macro-behaviour may be indeterministic even when its micro-behaviour is deterministic, so that the determinism-indeterminism distinction is best viewed as a level-relative distinction, rather than a levelindependent one. For a proof of concept, I will briefly sketch a toy model. I have
developed this model more fully in other work.29
Consider a system whose state evolves over time. At each point in time, the system is in a particular state, which we may interpret as a micro-level state, and some
state evolutions are permitted by the laws governing the system, while others are
not. A possible state evolution is called a possible history of the system. For our
example, suppose that all the possible micro-level histories are as shown on the lefthand side of Fig. 2.30 Little dots represent states in which the system could be at any
point in time (running from time t = 1 to time t = 6), and lines from bottom to top
represent histories. In a fairly clear diagrammatic sense, those histories are deterministic. Given the initial state of any such micro-level history, there is only one
possible way the history could evolve over time.
Suppose, however, we are interested not in the system’s micro-level states and
histories, but in its macro-states and macro-histories, as describable by some
higher-level concepts and categories. In the realm of human behaviour, the macrolevel could be that of psychology or the social sciences, as opposed to the level of
brain physiology. In accordance with a standard assumption about the relationship
between a system’s states at different levels, let us assume that macro-states supervene on micro-states but are multiply realizable by them, i.e., each macro-state corresponds to an entire equivalence class of micro-states, consisting of its possible
micro-level realizers. For concreteness, suppose that whenever two or more distinct
micro-level states fall within the same cell in the rectangular grid on the left-hand
side of Fig. 2, they each realize the same supervenient macro-state. The right-hand
side of Fig. 2 shows the resulting macro-level states and macro-level histories, represented by thick dots and thick lines, respectively.
We can see, again in a clear diagrammatic sense, that those macro-level histories are indeterministic. Given the same initial macro-state, the macro-level history

13

124

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

Fig. 2  Micro- and macro-level histories

could evolve in two or more distinct ways. The initial macro-state is insufficient to
determine all subsequent macro-level states.
This simple example shows that indeterminism in macro-level histories can go
along with determinism in the underlying micro-level histories. More generally, a
system’s dynamics at different levels need not “mesh”, as the philosopher of physics
Jeremy Butterfield puts it.31 Lower-level determinism can co-exist with higher-level
indeterminism, and even the converse is possible too. We may conclude that the sort
of physical determinism that is supported by some parts of science, including possibly some parts of neuroscience (if the hypothesis of the mechanical brain is true),
does not in any way rule out the sort of agential indeterminism that is presupposed
by some of our best explanations in the human and social sciences.
Some critics may object that the kind of “emergent” macro-level indeterminism
illustrated by Fig. 2 shouldn’t be viewed as a real phenomenon. Rather, it should
be viewed as merely epistemic: it is relative to the informational limitations of our
macro-level descriptions that we are unable to predict the macro-history based on
information about the initial macro-level state. But this, so the objection goes, does
not establish that the system is genuinely indeterministic.
However, since the distinction between determinism and indeterminism is levelrelative rather than level-independent, it would be ad hoc to single out some lower
level, say, the level of the brain, as the “correct” level at which questions about determinism and indeterminism are to be adjudicated and to dismiss the same distinction
at other levels (especially higher ones) as being of no significance. It is much less
arbitrary and more systematic to treat the phenomena at all levels as genuine aspects
of reality. Just as we wouldn’t regard DNA, ecosystems, and institutions as less real
than electrons, neutrons, and protons just because they are higher-level phenomena,
so we shouldn’t regard higher-level indeterminism as unreal.
More generally, I’d like to note that any definition of determinism is based on
some modal notion: a notion of possibility. While the definition of physical determinism is based on the notion of physical possibility, the definition of agential (in)
determinism is based on the notion of agential possibility. It is widely accepted that
different modal notions have their own legitimate place in science: in addition to the
31
See Butterfield (2012). Related points can be found in Yoshimi (2012) and, with a slightly different
interpretation (namely, observational indistinguishability of deterministic and indeterministic descriptions), Werndl (2009). For my own earlier analysis of the level-relativity of the determinism-indeterminism distinction, see, in particular, List and Pivato (2015), where we also respond to some objections.

13

Criminal Law and Philosophy (2024) 18:109–131

125

notion of physical possibility, there are also notions of chemical, biological, psychological, and even socio-economic possibility. Agential possibility is the modal
notion associated with our best theories of intentional agency. A scientist who is
committed to the naturalistic ontological attitude mentioned above has every reason
to take a realist attitude towards any modal notion that is well-supported by some
corresponding branch of science. And therefore, I conclude that we should be realists about agential possibility and the associated notion of agential indeterminism as
much as we are prepared to be realists about physical possibility and whatever the
physical sciences say about the determinism-indeterminism distinction at the levels
they are concerned with.
What we have arrived at is, in effect, a compatibilist version of free-will libertarianism: an account of free will that can simultaneously respect physical determinism,
the openness of choices, and realism about free will. The lesson is that Moore’s trilemma, at least when reframed in the way I have done, is only an apparent trilemma.
We don’t need to give up any of the three theses. Interestingly, Moore mentions
the idea that humans admit different levels of explanation, citing the work of William Bechtel and Carl Craver, as well as the idea, which he calls the “two-languages
view”, that humans may be free at the level of their mental states but determined
at the level of the underlying physical brain states.32 However, he doesn’t seem to
recognize the potential that these ideas offer for a robust defence of free will that
retains at least some of the intuitive force of libertarianism. He characterizes the
two-languages view, for instance, as a kind of “linguistic fictionalism”.33 Instead of
embracing the levelled picture, as noted above, he opts for what I would consider a
more watered-down account of free will, in the classical compatibilist tradition. But
fortunately, as we have seen, a more robust defence of free will can be given.

7  Retributivism Revisited
While I have agreed with responsibility sceptics such as Gregg Caruso and Derk
Pereboom that a classical compatibilist account of free will is too weak as a basis for
a retributivist approach to punishment, this still leaves room for saying that my own
compatibilist libertarian account is sufficiently robust to ground responsibility in the
required “basic desert” sense. Indeed, that’s the conclusion that a retributivist such
as Moore would presumably wish to draw. If Moore considers his own compatibilist defence of free will sufficient for retributivism, then a fortiori he should consider
the present more libertarian defence sufficient too. However, I now want to turn to
the negative point I announced. Although a robust defence of free will is available, I
think there are independent reasons for giving up retributivism and replacing it with
an approach to punishment that puts the emphasis on restoration and rehabilitation.
It would be unfortunate if critics of retributivism felt the need to argue against free

will in order to reject retributivism and to advocate criminal-justice reform.34 One
can be both a staunch realist about free will and a staunch critic of retributivism and
of harsh forms of punishment.
Retributivism, as Alec Walen characterizes it, is the view:
(1) “That those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious
crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment;
(2) That it is intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods
that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them the punishment they
deserve; and
(3) That it is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict
disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers.”35
The problems with this view are sociological on the one hand, and philosophical on the other. On the sociological side, the problem is that despite the constraints
implied by retributivism’s third claim—the prohibition on disproportionate punishment—retributivist ideas often seem to be invoked to justify harsh criminal-justice
systems, which by many critics’ accounts are not only inhumane but even counterproductive. While incarcerating many people, often in tough conditions, these
systems may still fail to deter crime and even contribute to vicious circles of more
crime and violence in the societies in question.36 Retributivism is arguably the doctrine behind much of the contemporary approach to criminal justice in the United
States, which has been widely criticized for being neither sufficiently humane nor
sufficiently effective.37 As observed by Francis Allen in the early 1980s, the “rehabilitative ideal”, which had long been a guiding principle in criminal punishment,
has been in decline in the United States since the 1970s.38 Similar trends can be seen
elsewhere too. As David Garland comments in his 2001 book,
“[f]or most of the twentieth century, penalties that appeared explicitly retributive or deliberately harsh were criticized as anachronisms that had no place
within a ‘modern’ penal system. In the last twenty years, however, we have
seen the reappearance of ‘just deserts’ retribution as a generalized policy goal
in the US and the UK, initially prompted by the perceived unfairness of indi34
Indeed, some leading critics, such as Caruso (2021), offer several arguments against retributivism,
only some (but not all) of which concern the issue of free will.

See Walen (2021). I note, however, that not all retributivists accept all three claims in precisely
this form. Berman (2022), for instance, defends retributivism against some influential objections and
describes a retributivist theory whose primary claims are that “culpable wrongdoers deserve to experience their wrongdoing as personally costly to them, and the state assumes a pro tanto duty to cause
wrongdoers to experience those costs in virtue of barring retaliation by victims and their surrogates” (p.
1).

See, e.g., Caruso (2021).

On the shift in emphasis from rehabilitation to retribution in American criminal justice, see, e.g.,
Allen (1981) and Garland (2001). Note that, according to World Prison Brief data (accessed on 19 October 2022), the US has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world (at 505 per 100,000 people,
compared to Germany’s 67 and Norway’s 57). Furthermore, prison conditions in the United States are
often considered harsher than in other countries at similar levels of economic development.

vidualized sentencing. This development has certainly promoted the concern
for proportionality and fixed sentencing for which its liberal proponents had
hoped. But it has also re-established the legitimacy of an explicitly retributive
discourse, which, in turn, has made it easier for politicians and legislatures to
openly express punitive sentiments and to enact more draconian laws.”39
I must emphasize that the retributivist view consisting of claims (1)–(3) above
does not logically entail a commitment to a harsh—let alone draconian—approach
to punishment. Indeed, as a philosophical view, it is compatible with the assumption
that only light punishments are ever deserved, and some philosophical proponents
of retributivism have explicitly criticized overpunishment.40 In theory, retributivism
is primarily a view about the point, purpose, and justification of punishment, not a
view about its severity. Yet, once we consider public discourse instead of academic
philosophy, the worry is that an appeal to retributivist ideas may contribute to a
punitive culture in the societies in question.
However, even if we thought that retributivist discourse need not have any bad
societal effects, retributivism still has a philosophical problem. There seems to be no
good reason for accepting retributivism’s claim that wrongdoers deserve to suffer a
punishment that takes the form of a setback to their interests and that inflicting this
setback upon them is intrinsically good, irrespective of any other goods the punishment may produce.41 According to a widely accepted moral principle,
intentionally inflicting a harm upon someone—intentionally setting back their
interests—is justifiable only if this is strictly necessary for something that takes
sufficiently strong moral priority, and thus if it is, in a sense, unavoidable.
I find it difficult to square retributivism with this principle. First of all, it seems
implausible that the harm that is intentionally inflicted upon a wrongdoer in a system of retributive justice is always necessary in the required sense. Retribution is not
necessary, for instance, if there are alternative ways of achieving deterrence and/or
compensation or if the retributive punishment could be replaced by a more constructive process, such as an acknowledgement of the wrong that was committed, combined with a requirement to compensate the victim(s) of that wrong and somehow
to make up for it and/or to serve the community. Moreover, even in cases in which
inflicting a harm on someone is genuinely necessary and unavoidable, such as in
certain cases of self-defence, this is always regrettable and not something we would
wish to describe as “intrinsically good”. So, even if wrongdoers genuinely deserved

39

See Garland (2001, pp. 8–9).
See, e.g., Husak (2020). Husak suggests that “a retributive penal philosophy should not be blamed for
contributing to our present epidemic of mass incarceration and tendency to over-punish” (abstract), and
he argues that, by retributivist standards, “many persons deserve less punishment than our legal system
currently inflicts” (p. 3). In this context, recall again retributivism’s claim (3), the prohibition on disproportionate punishment.
41
For an in-depth philosophical critique of retributivism, see, e.g., Shafer-Landau (1996). I can here
give only a brief sketch of my philosophical reservations about retributivism.

to be punished, the claim that inflicting this punishment upon them is intrinsically
good—retributivism’s second claim—would still seem hard to defend.
It is certainly plausible that if someone has committed a wrong for which they
are responsible, they are under an obligation to apologize, to put things right, and to
engage in certain compensatory and/or restorative activities. Deriving such an obligation from the wrongdoing seems straightforward and non-mysterious—and certainly not in breach of any familiar moral principles. It is also plausible that someone
responsible for a serious wrong may have forfeited the right not to be interfered with
for protective purposes, possibly in the form of imprisonment, in case they continue
to pose a significant risk to the community. The interference will then be instrumentally justified by reference to its practical necessity for protecting the rights of others.
By contrast, it is much more of a stretch to derive the intrinsic goodness of inflicting a retributive harm on someone from the fact that they have committed a wrong.
If I wrong you, then I certainly incur an obligation to apologize to you and to put
things right, as far as possible. But why should it suddenly become intrinsically
good for some third party, such as the state, to inflict some harm on me as a punishment, irrespective of any other goods that are promoted by this, such as deterrence,
protection of the community, compensation, or education?
My sense is that while retributivism might capture some people’s pre-theoretic
intuitions about punishment, some of its core claims, namely (1) and (2) in Walen’s
characterization of the view, lack any compelling philosophical grounding. Only
claim (3) is a welcome prohibition on unjustified and disproportionate punishment.
Apart from the fact that claims (1), (2), and (3) might jointly capture certain pretheoretic intuitions, I find it hard to see why we should independently believe claims
(1) and (2).
Since a retributivist account of punishment suffers from these philosophical difficulties, quite apart from any political reservations we may have about retributivist
discourse, we have good reasons to look for a non-retributivist alternative. There are
several competing accounts of punishment on offer, and this paper is not the place
to settle the question of which account is best. Broadly speaking, there are those
proposals which, despite giving up the idea of retribution, continue to treat responsibility attributions as central to a system of criminal justice and those that largely
dispense with responsibility attributions.
Some of the proposals made by responsibility sceptics such as Gregg Caruso and
Derk Pereboom fall into the latter camp.42 Both Caruso and Pereboom propose to
reconceptualize the idea of criminal justice around an analogy with public health.
Just as, in many countries, COVID-19 patients are required to quarantine until they
are sufficiently recovered to generate no further infection risks for others, so criminals who have committed serious offences may be required to “quarantine” for some
time to protect the community or to give them a chance to undergo rehabilitation.
Caruso suggests that public-health ethics provides a useful and humane framework
for justifying criminal sanctions on the model of quarantine in the domain of public
health, without invoking any logic of retribution.

I can see the appeal of such a framework, especially from a consequentialist perspective, and I agree that if we were forced to give up the idea of responsibility altogether—perhaps in response to the challenges from neuroscience—the public-health
analogy would offer a promising way to reconceptualize criminal justice.
That said, my own realism about free will and responsibility leads me to prefer a
more deontological approach, in which responsibility attributions continue to play
an important role in criminal justice. The approach I favour is a restorative-justice
one in which offenders are still recognized as responsible for the wrongs they have
committed and in which they incur the obligation not only to accept accountability but also to restore moral relations, for instance by apologizing to the victims of
those wrongs, by offering compensation and, where possible, making up for those
wrongs, and/or by engaging in appropriate forms of community service.43 Crucially,
the process is a constructive and forward-looking one. The aim is not to set back the
interests of the offender but to restore communal relations within the relevant moral
community. And even if, as a byproduct of the process, the offender’s interests are
set back, which may sometimes be unavoidable, this is not the point and purpose of
the punishment.44
While this is clearly a non-retributivist approach to punishment, it is one that
still relies on realism about free will and responsibility. One important step towards
achieving restorative justice is precisely the acknowledgement that a wrongdoer is
responsible for something he or she has done, that he or she ought to have acted otherwise, and that he or she is now under an obligation to put things right. Regardless
of the material burden that “putting things right” ends up imposing on the offender
(the burden could be modest, or it could be significant, depending on the wrong in
question), the very acknowledgement that the offender is responsible is already a key
element in the restoration of good relations within the relevant moral community.
In sum, I agree with Michael Moore that something would be lost from the perspective of criminal justice if we had to give up the ideas of free will and responsibility, and that it is important to defend those ideas against the challenges from neuroscience. But I also agree with sceptics such as Gregg Caruso and Derk Pereboom
that a retributivist approach to punishment is unattractive and that we should reform
our criminal-justice systems in a non-retributivist manner. The reason I reach this
conclusion, however, is not that I think that neuroscience has refuted free will, but
that there are good independent reasons for giving up retributivism and for replacing
it with an approach to criminal justice that takes the idea of responsibility seriously
while reconceptualizing punishment in a constructive and forward-looking way.

Pereboom, there is still some common ground between us. I refer readers to the forward-looking account

Abstract
Happiness, well-being, human freedom, and life events are interconnected. Nevertheless, the debate about human well-being struggles to find an exact definition.
Literature debates on the importance of positive psychology or adverse effects of
negative psychology in the well-being context discuss separately. However, both
counter each other but have their significance and indisputable fact. Human psychology evolves around determinism and Free Will. One type of determinism is hard,
while the other is soft. Individuals who are adamant about and embrace acceptance
of chances are driven by their nature and psychology to choose negative behaviors
under hard determinism. They give up their free will, whereas soft determinists use
it to make choices and behave positively. However, the researchers looked at negative psychology as a useful aspect and positive psychology’s dark side. We argued
that there are reasons to suppose that chances can develop into options and vice
versa. From a well-being perspective, negative and positive psychological strengths
and weaknesses can be investigated. From the literature review, useful hypotheses
for future research have been derived from our synthesis.

Introduction
The debate about human well-being is vast and growing, yet struggling to find an
exact definition (Dodge et al., 2012). Decades ago, a consistent correlation between
personality, life experiences, wellbeing, and ill-being became a reason to coin a theory of subjective wellbeing (SWB) constructed on the dynamic equilibrium (DE)
approach (Headey & Wearing, 1989). This equilibrium is defined as human wellbeing related to individuals in one or all the following (Herzlich, 1973)
a)
b)
c)
d)

Sufficient supply of physical resources, an absence of exhaustion
Psychological wellbeing and even temperament
Freedom of movement and efficacy in action
Positive interpersonal social relationships

Since the glorious dawn of the recorded history of research, human wellbeing
or happiness has been the subject of enormous quantities of thinking and investigation. Subjective wellbeing encompasses both emotional reactions and cognitive
judgments in describing how people view the quality of their lives. It proposes
three separate but frequently connected well-being components: regular positive
affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive assessments such as life satisfaction
(Diener et al., 1999). If an individual could result in excessive positive effects over
adverse effects, one would desire positive psychology due to well-being (Bradburn,
1969). Psychological well-being is renowned for consciousness, situation awareness, and mindfulness. There is a sense of being in oneself and embracing truths
about thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It adds significance to one’s life to practice, set objectives, and execute action plans to achieve them. Self-assertiveness is
the habit of respecting one’s needs and interests and expressing them appropriately.
It is preserving alignment between one’s beliefs and actions that works for one’s
health. Individuals hold Identity and self-responsibility congenital to the practice to
become owning one’s actions and attribution (Branden, 1969). Branden contends
that low self-esteem is a psychological condition that can lead to pathologies such
as defensiveness, anxiety, depression, and relationship troubles. Self-esteem relies
on internally created behaviors. Branden emphasizes the need for internally created
practices to improve and maintain self-esteem. He was named "the father of the concept of self-esteem." Branden continually emphasized the importance of instilling a
passion for the "self-esteem movement" through education, which led to the formation of the Self-Esteem Movement.
Skinner (1955) contends that science explains behavioral causes or conditions
beyond human reach. Because causal explanations are proven, it is hard to establish a practical corollary for individuals. It is easy to stimulate causal conditions
in which planned behavior can result from external factors. Skinner (1961) later
added beneficial propositions to social behavior to pave the way for developing
new, better, and justified hypotheses. Frederic Skinner argued that a man should
be joyful, informed, skilled, well-behaved, and productive. The scientific study
of these attractive propositions validates the general pattern of such reasonable

assumptions and promises new and improved ideas. Emerging hypothesis reinforced group inclusion studies to serve collective wellbeing purpose for adopting
this subject in managing individual behavior.
Happiness, wellbeing, human freedom, and life events are interconnected.
Westcott (2012) underlined the conceptual issues of philosophical literature on
freedom underlining three premises.
a) There is a commitment to one or another doctrine of Free Will.
b) The assumption is that the life of humankind is continued within the framework
of a social organization.
c) There is a perception that exercising Free Will is a desirable trait that society
should discourage to the greatest possible extent.
Free Will is a particularly thorny problem. According to humanistic psychologists like Maslow (1981) and Rogers (1989), Freedom is conceivable and necessary to become fully effective human beings. It is prudent to assume that the
presence of society is required for human life (Sappington, 1990). This is an
unprovable assumption, but it is valuable for future theorizing. There is factual
evidence that humans live in groups effectively in independent countries where
freedom philosophy is practiced. Due to profound human natural complexities,
conflicts are also arising simultaneously. Because human freedom is regarded
as a fundamental virtue in political and social structure as a sign of liberty, the
desire for Free Will research is a correct measure to manage human variations
in a social context. Personal beliefs in a democratic will are linked to various
positive life outcomes, including subjective happiness. It evolves around Free
Will, social groups, and individual desire range philosophies and control mechanisms that concern the momentum of freedom and happiness. However, Free Will
beliefs are related to personality or individual subjective well-being or dependent
on socio-centric factors (Gooding et al., 2018). Personality analysis is not just an
empiricism-based discipline. It derives broad findings from active parts of literature, science, and philosophy. Numerous historical and contemporary personality theories have shown that personality analysis is derived from various sources
(Engler, 1999).
Human freedom or determinism refers to the ability of an individual to regulate
and comprehend the reasons for their behaviors. Human behavior is influenced by
either cause over which a person usually has no control and has no Free Will.
Different hypotheses define activity as unconscious, biological, sociocultural, and
environmental factors (Cloninger, 2008; Engler, 2008). Thus, personality refers
to the distinctive patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that define an individual. Prominent scholars consented that personality develops within an individual and remains stable throughout life (See further Allport, 1927; Maslow, 1981;
Rogers, 1989).
Active versus reactive factors investigate whether people primarily respond
and learn through individual (dynamic) or external stimuli (reactive). In contrast,
behaviors and cognitive theorists underline the value of fundamental values such

13

1094

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

as strengthening self and striving for self-efficacy. Most modern theorists agree
that both are significant. The critical predictor for action is aggregate behavior
decided by characters and situation factors. Usually, conventional behavioral
theories assume that their surroundings unconsciously influence people (e.g.,
Fleeson, 2004; Zayas & Shoda, 2009). Theories of positive or negative personal psychology believe in psychological variance because people can learn
how to change their personalities because of conscious acts. The enduring theory of learning presents the same phenomena that defined interactive learning
as a dynamic and continuous process in quest of this understanding. Any single
approach is not appropriate to fix overall situations about human development
(e.g., Engler, 1999, 2008).
Determinism explains the philosophy behind invisible human learning through
genetic, natural, and environmental factors. These factors have a natural application
to all human behaviors; once established, they are extremely difficult or impossible to modify. For instance, a human positive or negative psychology helps comprehend how one reacts to a unique situation. These n aspects of human psychology
are known as innate capacity, or the ability one displays to respond to stimuli (See
further Baldassare, 1978; Pratto, 1991). Inherited traits remain more stable and difficult to alter, such as personality, temperaments, and positive or negative psychology.
In the human biological development phase, psychological and emotional needs
emerge in planning about self, career plans, and achieving and maintaining social
status. Through typical behavioral planning, self-care produces a stable human
social behavior by a law-abiding, positive attitude towards self, life, and society. Biological development includes getting mature, parenthood, and retirement. Other habits change according to human biological learning of conscious learning and need
(e.g., Ajzen, 1987; Alarcon et al., 2009; Barrick & Mount, 1991; Caspi et al., 2005;
Demetriou, 2003). Argyle and Lu (1990) noted that the human mind often remains
influenced by emotions, exposes its learning attitudes, and stimulates these values
through social actions. Such extroverted individuals are always inclined to social
gatherings, and introverted people do not (See further Eysenck, 1987; Eysenck et
al., 1985; Fiske, 1949; Fleeson, 2004). Like other organisms, human behavior is a
continuum in which some behaviors are more prevalent than others.
Acceptance of human behavior depends on social expectations. Free Will and
determinism can be perceived as chance and choice. It revolves around how much
behavior is determined by forces that individuals have no control over. A sustainable development proposal suggests combining positive and negative aspects of
human psychology. It is worth mentioning that psychological wellbeing and distress
were noted not on opposite ends of the continuum. Therefore, a reasonable debate
is needed about whether and when research participants should be asked questions
(See further Winefield et al., 2012).

psychology evolved around negative psychology discovery immediately following World War II. It can be applied to any experience, for example, by looking into
research inclination in history. Taking a brief look at positive and negative affectivity literature, one may understand its effect better separately. Psychology had a triangulation mission to discover 1) healing mental disease, 2) improving the productivity and fulfillment of all people’s lives, and 3) finding and developing exceptional
potential. The research focused on underlying and resolving human beings’ sickness
and poor functioning problems through negative psychology. Bradburn (1969) highlighted well-being and theorized the self-esteem importance concept. Psychology
has the theoretical ability to commit time and resources to positive subjective experiences, positive individual attributes, and positive institutions. Proceeding its scope,
Seligman (1990) and Ryff (1995)escalated this notion and unfolded its enormous
benefits for humans. Researchers wanted to know what causes pleasure, how optimism and hope affect health and wisdom, and how to best nurture talent and creativity. Well-being-related constructs were nurtured, assessed, and overwhelmingly
accepted in the realm of positive psychology. It resulted in large-scale encouragement to advocate those positive psychological beliefs that should not be neglected.
The negative and positive psychology debate has scarcely been combined until
now. Forgas (2013) was among the few who witnessed the strengths of negative psychology. Some scholars have also brought the dark side of positivity into the discussion. This article examines how positive and negative psychology can be seen
together in a well-being context. Negative and positive psychology can be seen
together in a well-being context. This article examines how human Free Will and
determination can be combined with flexible positive and negative psychology. It
also discusses what can be achieved through this context in the future by combining
these two approaches. Negative psychology can enhance understanding of cognitive
processing structures to support better decisions and communicate more effectively
in individual behavior research. It is possible to think about the utility of negative
psychology for human well-being. It is possible to think about the utility of negative
psychology for human well-being.
Literature Review
Behaviorist philosophy suggests that conditioning is the key to shaping human
behavior. The nature vs. nurture issue, according to many scientists, is no longer relevant. Scholars argue that no single factor can influence human development. Biological determinism is an oversimplified ideology (Jordan & Hartling, 2002). Social
sciences studies include psychology, sociology, economics, and anthropology in
human behavior (Pratto, 1991). Many researchers believe that behavioral determinism can be attributed to the socio-economic conditions of humans. Environmental
Free Will is an accurate view of causal influences over human action (Alper, 1998).
In sociology, the conduct, including those with no significance – no person acts, can
apply to all basic human actions (Abbas et al., 2021c; Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992;
Brent & Thompson, 1999). Scholars are concerned about the considerable influence
of social and cultural interaction and ethical, social, and authoritarian conditions on

13

1096

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

human behavior. Social behavior is an integral part of human behavior that accounts
for acts aimed at others. Conduct should not be confused with social behavior in this
general context (e.g., Bandura, 2014; Bromiley & Rau, 2016; Brown et al., 2005;
George & Bettenhausen, 1990). Behavior stability and compliance are inherited or
result from individual efforts known for forming social identities. People are multiidentity collections: Age, height, weight, sex, ethnicity, nationality, and social background play key role in defining their role in society. They can also be categorized
according to their religious views or activities. Accordingly, one can gain low or
high social status (e.g., Herd, 2010; Lapiņa et al., 2014; Mudor, 2011; Pratto, 1991;
Terborg, 1981).
Skinner (1950) recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human
behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of
response sequences. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept
of rule-governed behavior. First, simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to jump and open a book. After many responses come
under such verbal control, a sequence of stimuli can evoke an unrestricted complex response. Herrnstein (1988) provided its operational definition and explained
that human behavior response intensity in group stimuli improves behaviors and
characteristics. As a result, individuals can generate an adaptive response by
observing the surrounding environment, which is beneficial for individual behavior. A changeable range of possibilities is suitable for rational assumptions of conditions depending upon thought process and calculation of risk versus benefits.
Broad genetic or biological features also assist in understanding human behaviors
(Pierce & Cheney, 2013).
Another view that helps in understanding human behavioral conditions is called
classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is different from operating conditions,
which change the intensity of a voluntary action using enhancement or penalty, also
known as instrumental conditioning. Classically conditioned stimuli improve operating responses, influencing operating conditioning (Coon et al., 2021). Classical
conditioning is a fundamental learning mechanism that starts to be comprehended
by observing behaviors against neural substrates. Classical conditions are difficult
to explain due to associative learning like instrumental knowledge and human memory. They are differentiated by several observations, particularly the contingencies
of learning (McSweeney & Murphy, 2014). One of the key reasons to research personality and health is to understand ways of improving health and reducing mortality risk. It also demonstrates that causal model perspectives cannot measure traditional health and well-being theories that are unsustainable in a more complex and
extended lifespan. Some standard measures are unjustified, and better evaluation
techniques are needed (Friedman & Kern, 2014). For instance, systematic biases in
quantifying stable personality patterns and relationships to well-being and health
occur (Hu et al., 2016). Dodge et al. (2012) defined well-being and said it is essential to know the history of the well-being study. Individuals may be asked how well
they feel, how well they cope, and how happy they are with life in outcome measures of well-being. Researchers found two approaches: the hedonic tradition that
accentuated buildings such as pleasure, positive impact, low negative impact, and
satisfaction with life and eudemonic practice, highlighting positive psychological

functioning and human growth (e.g., Diener et al., 1985; Kahneman et al., 1999;
Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999; Ruini & Ryff, 2016; Ryff, 2013; Ryff & Keyes, 1995;
Ryff & Singer, 2008; Waterman, 1993).
Dodge et al. (2012) considered that finding the exact definition of well-being is
nuanced, but ascertaining an accurate description is challenging. Dodge and colleagues concentrated on three main areas to get closer to a new definition: 1) The
idea of a fixed point for wellbeing, 2) the inescapability of equilibrium, and 3) the
fluctuating condition between difficulties and resources. Education has been seen as
playing a vital role in the growth of people when it comes to the content of health
and wellbeing achievement. Consequently, a balanced view should be suggested
about human resource skills and the challenges in front of them. It allows to discover
more about individuals, develop social skills, and spread health-related messages
(Connolly et al., 2019). This idea has been included for human capital development
and improving self-efficacy research. Human physical, emotional, social, and psychological health notions are intertwined with education (Judd et al., 2019). To be
safe, the community and the world must exist in an environment that can accommodate the individual’s pursuit of health and wellbeing (Palvalin, 2017). Wellness is
where health and quality of life are satisfied with all aspects, such as family, friends,
income, and individual satisfaction (Marmot, 2005).
In studies of human psychology, freedom is consistently ignored or reduced to
illusions, sentiments, or beliefs that may be examined deterministically. Human freedom in all its genuine senses appears to be as essential to the actual conduct of science as it is to scientific research. This way connects with factors that contribute to
individuals’ well-being. Human liberty is a fundamental idea in moral and spiritual
living. Andrew (1980) explained the importance of human freedom and its determinants. Its relevant emphasis on the powers of consciousness, choice, creativity, and
symbolization provides a foundation for holding humans partially, but realistically,
accountable for their conduct and living conditions.
The above literature indicates that individual well-being is not limited to a single
factor. The well-being topic is gaining popularity in positive psychology research
due to its cognitive and affective association with the human mind striving for selfefficacy. Other notions of the positive human development of social fabric, diversity management, and managing individual differences are associated with this topic
strategically (e.g., Abbas et al., 2021a, b, 2022b). Complete well-being is a sense of
wellness that includes mental, physical, social, emotional, and intellectual developments. This perspective is subjective because it is derived from developing one’s
sense of self-wellness.
In contrast to this view, negative psychology has been explored for adverse
actions (See further Abbas, 2022; Abbas et al., 2021a). Negativity affectivity can
boost memory, reduce judgment errors, and improve communication via altering
cognitive processing style. It can also boost tenacity, effort, and motivation. With
negative psychology, individuals can make more likely to treat others decently and
persuade others (Matovic et al., 2014). However, some recent developments postulate its strengths as well
Even though the literature lacks a comprehensive evaluation of research on both
positive and negative aspects of psychology, this topic has a considerable amount of

13

1098

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

promise for several different propositions. Hence, in this article’s upcoming section,
we review the strengths and weaknesses of both aspects of well-being literature to
develop a taxonomy.
Understanding Positive Psychology Strengths for Well‑Being
Well-being research measured human motivation and personality motives (Maslow,
1981). High levels of life satisfaction assist people in focusing on work without
being distracted, encouraging them to solve problems instead of ignoring them. Life
satisfaction and evaluation of various aspects of one’s life is a sign of self-efficacy,
personal mastery, and life satisfaction. A growing group of like-minded professionals shares a mission to uplift others through positive psychology. Optimism is
concerned with evaluating one’s expectations for the future, which is based on an
expectation that many cheerful and few negative things will occur. Caprara et al.
(2017) optimism could increase self-esteem and optimism while increasing life satisfaction. Self-esteem, life satisfaction, and optimism are characterized by similar
evaluative processes, resulting in a generally favorable attitude toward oneself, life,
and the future (Caprara & Steca, 2005). A growing group of like-minded professionals shares a mission to uplift others through positive psychology. Seligman (2007)
asserted that positive psychology might aid in the development of training and
accreditation standards. Coaching is an activity in quest of two solid foundations:
1) A scientific, evidence-based foundation, and 2) A theoretical, hypothesis-driven
strength of character. Seligman believes that the emerging field of positive psychology can provide both support pillars. An optimistic approach can give coaching in a
clearly defined scope of practice, with effective treatments and measures, and obtain
the requisite skills to become a coach. Individuals’ ability to identify themselves as
coaches is uncontrolled, so a scientific and theoretical foundation could benefit the
profession. Positive psychology theoretical aspects are concerned with investigating
positive emotion, engagement, and meaning; the three components provide a scientifically understandable explanation for the concept of happiness. Other aspects to
consider are just the scientific evidence for positive psychology based on empirical
study (e.g., Adler & Seligman, 2016; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014). Nyabul
and Situma (2014) found that happiness is particularly appealing because it is complete and does not require additional products to complete and improve it. This view
is entirely self-contained by a positive inner self that cannot be built upon because
it already possesses all essential elements. People’s well-being has improved dramatically during the previous century and a half due to breakthroughs in technology.
Today’s technology is only beginning to realize many breakthroughs in computer
science, information science, statistics, and quantitative sociology. The internet has
benefited people rather than harmed them because it removes boundaries and supports collective social goals. Subsequent progress has been made toward clarifying
the primary contributors to social change.
The topic of well-being has included income, physical health, marriage, optimism, and social support (Adler & Seligman, 2016; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2013).
Positive psychology includes practicing gratitude, social appreciation, cultivating

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

1099

personal strengths, and keeping everyday learning. Two components characterize it: the cognitive, which corresponds to life satisfaction, and the effective, which
corresponds to the predominance of positive affect over negative affect in one’s
life. Empathy, social connection, and kindness are crucial in positive psychology
research. Overall health may lead to eudemonic happiness and quality of life (e.g.,
Connolly et al., 2019; Kirby & Harter, 2001; Lapiņa et al., 2014; Meltzoff, 2011;
Ruini & Ryff, 2016; Ryff, 2013; Ryff & Keyes, 1995; Ryff & Singer, 2008). The
concept of well-being refers to an all-encompassing evaluation of a community’s
overall health. A safe community has general tolerance and acceptance of others. It
is measured across five areas: opportunity, connectivity, contribution, and inspiration. Organizational well-being programs emphasize the human side of the business.
It is known as collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across five
areas named vitality, opportunity, connectivity, contribution, and inspiration (Roy
et al., 2018).
Understanding Negative Psychology Strengths for Well‑Being
Social isolation, low community engagement, and low trust in the government are
signs of a negative psychosocial environment. People with high negative affectivity
have a pessimistic attitude about themselves and their world. Negative affectivity
depends heavily on the enjoyment of personal life. The similarities between these
affective traits and life satisfaction led some researchers to consider both positive and
negative impacts on life satisfaction (e.g., Jeronimus et al., 2014; Watson & Clark,
1984). Such viewpoints are essential components of the social identity approach
for an individual. They are partly formed to answer concerns arising in response to
social identity theory (Turner & Reynolds, 2012). The self-categorization theory has
had a significant impact on academia and beyond. The mechanistic underpinnings
of social identification through self-categorization theory and its scientific research
approach have significantly impacted academia and beyond social psychology. It
was initially used to discuss social power, group solidarity, group polarization, and
collective action (Haslam et al., 2020). One of the theory’s tenets is that the self
cannot be thought of as a fundamental part of cognition but rather because of the
cognitive system at work. In both positive and negative psychology, people are more
likely to have one stronger set of stimuli. According to the meta-contrast theorem,
an object has a difference between one stimulus and another (See further Onorato &
Turner, 2002; Turner et al., 1987; Turner & Onorato, 1999). A normative fit is how
a person’s perceived actions, characteristics, or set of individuals correspond to the
perceiver’s knowledge-based expectations. While a group may be classified as an
organization based on close fit, they are only labeled "knowledge learners" if they
are hard workers (Eaves & Eysenck, 1975; Teo et al., 1999). The drivers of wellbeing are distinct from those of ill-being. Extraversion, constructive thought patterns, and intrinsic motivation are examples of these personality characteristics. The
degree to which these beneficial characteristics can be learned or taught at the community level (e.g., through education or workplace training) reflects additional ways
to boost flourishing across the population. That is, they fall within the category’s

13

1100

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

normative content (e.g., Johnson et al., 2012; Núñez et al., 2018). Smith and Christakis (2008) expanded the view of social relationships through many distinct social
exchange features. They found that the absence of social interactions causes social
isolation. It can be referred to as low participation in informal social interactions,
such as family life. Formal social relations where one purely wants to be part of their
own will could result from selfish nature or seeing personal benefits. In addition, the
social participation of a self-interested individual correlates with particular health
problems and biological indications as pre-clinical conditions or symptoms (Ertel
et al., 2009). The likelihood of engaging in specific health behaviors in response to
stress tends to change over time (Umberson et al., 2010). A straightforward finding
of one negative intention cannot be determined quickly. Individuals want to develop
a straightforward approach to being happier and more accessible. The inner fear
made it difficult to consider social inclusion, which determined permanent social
isolation (Cloninger, 2004). A pessimistic personality tends to have a more negativeor realistic view of life. Negative psychology self-provocation for personal gains
causes a social exclusion as chosen act. Many researchers support that positive psychology is useful for well-being. It has also been advocated that it can result destructively, e.g., becoming self-oriented (Berman & Small, 2012). Negative affectivity is
destructive to one’s health to dwell on negative thoughts that could result in hedonic
adaptation. A negative mind would acquire acclimation to either positive or negative stimuli. The emotional consequences of that stimulus become less intense with
repeated exposure to it. Negative affectivity has a few interpersonal advantages, and
research subjects may become more courteous and attentive toward others (Forgas,
2013). Negative affectivity is a subconscious signal of a problematic social climate
and can increase social norms (Altan-Atalay & Zeytun, 2020; Watson & Clark,
1984). Negative affectivity is a subconscious signal of a problematic social climate
and can control social norms. Linking emotions with negative affect can also have
interpersonal advantages. Negative affect’s adaptive functions could benefit both
applied and healthcare practitioners. It allows for more careful interpretations and
more respectful and attentive interpersonal techniques (Forgas, 2011). Negative
affect can increase concentration and encoding by bringing in more accommodative and externally oriented processing (Forgas & Tan, 2013). Linking emotions
with negative affect can also have interpersonal advantages. It allows for more careful interpretations and respectful and attentive interpersonal techniques. Negative
affect’s adaptive functions could benefit both applied and healthcare practitioners.
Mood effects arise with a discreet approach in real-life environments (Forgas, 2013).
Researchers found an inverse relationship between religiosity and intellect. Religious people are less likely to participate in analytical processes. They are more
likely to accept intuitive responses at face value, which lowers intelligence test
results. Intuitive decision-making facilitates and distinguishes religious cognition
(Morgan, 2016; Norenzayan & Gervais, 2013; Oviedo, 2015). Religiosity can trigger a reduction in the ability to solve complex problems. The religious effect would
be detrimental when dealing with issues that require counterintuitive answers. However, religiosity does not affect all thinking tasks due to cognitive-behavioral bias.
Reasoning tasks that do not have intuitively obvious but logically correct answers
can trigger the religious effect (Daws & Hampshire, 2017).

The concept of psychological well-being focuses on the positive aspects of one’s
life. It can be called a mix of feeling good and working efficiently. Individuals do not
need to feel happy; painful feelings (disappointment, loss, and grief) are a natural
part of life. Managing these negative or painful emotions is necessary for long-term
happiness (Abbas et al., 2021a). Negative feelings that are intense or last for a long
time can jeopardize a person’s ability to work, compromising psychological wellbeing. Mach, silence, burnout /emotional exhaustion, and disengagements are prime
interests of recent research. Negative emotions are notable for shaping individual
behavior in organizational management studies (Abbas, 2022).
One of these characteristics is known as Mach behavior, which signifies cunningness, the capacity to be manipulative, and a determination to use whatever means
required to obtain power (e.g., Christie & Geis, 1970; Paulhus & Williams, 2002).
Another type of conduct is known as silence behavior, and it is a phenomenon that
occurs in social groups. Employees’ use of quiet in the workplace is a threat to the
ethics and success of the firm. Silent behavior occurs when people keep their opinions to themselves (Abbas et al., 2021a). When one individual refuses to speak with
another verbally or hold their opinion, this pattern of behavior is known as "the quiet
behavior." The application of silent behavior has ties with both one’s professional
life and one’s personal life. People who use their right to remain silent could even
deny the other party’s existence while they defend their point of view if they want
to do so. This kind of behavior is dangerous in many different ways, such as permitting and tolerating a form of emotional abuse (Alparslan et al., 2015). The conduct
of remaining silent is one of the most common factors contributing to social injustice. According to research, both men and women can engage in quiet conduct in
relationship dynamics, whether at work or in their personal lives. The silent treatment discourages individuals from working through their differences in a constructive manner (Martins, 1982). The behavior of silence is a barrier to positive conduct
in both the workplace and social life. Researchers argued that silence might be one
of the primary reasons people are okay with modern slavery (e.g., Godwyll, 2022)
From adverse effects and plentiful behaviors that could abstain human well-being
to harm the performance of organizations, societies, and personal lives actions and
moralities. The psychological, sociological, and organizational factors that contribute to quiet behaviors could be linked to negative individual psychology, social
characteristics, and organizational characteristics (e.g., Duan et al., 2016; Hassan
et al., 2019; Lam & Xu, 2019; Tangirala & Ramanujam, 2008). Emotional exhaustion leads and controls human emotions in many ways. It is known as emotional
fatigue. It leads to adverse behaviors that allow much control over the cognitive
decision-making abilities of individuals (Abbas et al., 2021a). However, it depends
on the human’s ability to absorb stress; hence, the outcome for individuals can be
different according to their nature (See further Abbas, 2022). Emotional exhaustion
is a chronic state of physical and emotional depletion. Caused by excessive work,
personal responsibilities, and vulnerability to stress, exhaustion persists over a long
period. It comprises three interconnected components: emotional weariness, depersonalization, and a reduction in perceived personal accomplishment (e.g., Maslach,
1982; Maslach & Jackson, 1981; Maslach et al., 2001). The above are reasons for
disengagement, and the start of an amoral process of convincing oneself those

13

1102

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

standard ethical principles do not apply to them. Hence, people react according to
the reasoning they have set for themselves. They could distance themselves from
dissociating moral reactions to inhumane behavior. Individuals can disable selfcondemnation to remain satisfied with their actions. Moral disengagement occurs
when destructive activity is re-framed as ethically acceptable without modifying the
behavior or the moral norms (Kahn, 1990).

The Methodology of the Study
Taxonomy can be used with literature synthesis to describe existing reviews (Cooper,
1988). Researchers suggest how the taxonomy might help us better judge the quality
of future knowledge synthesis efforts. A set of general criteria for evaluating reviews
is laid out. The body of literature known as taxonomy contains information on practically every known aspect. This type of literature contains, in many instances, all of
the information that is currently known about a particular issue (Padial et al., 2010).
This is especially true for the most diverse groups and has received the slightest
research.
An integrated review is a particular type of study in that it uses current literature to generate new understanding. Torraco (2016b) acknowledged the importance
of a consolidative literature review to give a sense of unity and logic reassessment.
For example, authors may highlight literature limitations, add new theories to the
reconceptualization, and develop a new abstract logically. There would be a need
for evidence for readers to follow the connection between the stated problem in
this case. Developing the latest phenomenon and new research strategy would help
acquire attention on why this topic has not gained the acceptance it deserves among
researchers in the past (Van Zomeren et al., 2008; Wyborn et al., 2018).
Moreover, it has been argued that the author may expand their view of interlinking to acknowledge and develop the latest direction by positively identifying and
organizing a collective review (Toronto & Remington, 2020; Torraco, 2005, 2016a).
Integrative research methods help researchers gain insights into present beliefs
regarded as accurate and allow setting new propositions. When nurtured with the
questioning of assumptions, they contribute to the advancement of academic inquiry
(Ramirez et al., 2015). For example, this study incorporates positive and negative
psychological contexts, which have distinct value in literature reviews but rarely
combined in studies or taxonomies on well-being learning.
Developing Taxonomy of Negative vs. Positive Psychology Behavioral Planning
A literature synthesis of positive and negative psychological interventions with
which taxonomy or insights into the presence of both elements in a social environment is scarce. Campbell and Fehr (1990) observed that people with low negative affectivity are excessively optimistic. They are determined to change others
cannot perceive or follow their instinct. A few studies have tried to gather human
strengths and weaknesses to benefit individuals, organizations, and the community

1103

environment. The field of well-being science focuses on what makes people prosper
and improves their quality of life from positive and negative psychological aspects.
Huppert (2009) noted that feeling good includes positive emotions of happiness and
contentment and emotions like curiosity, commitment, trust, and love. The idea of
functioning entails realizing one’s full potential, having some influence over one’s
existence, understanding intent, and meaningful relationships (Bhullar et al., 2013).
A mind under the influence of negative affectivity, on the other hand, is believed
to improve the precision with which social expectations and inferences for self are
made. It benefits from advances in understanding the biological and social pathways
to well-being from adverse behavior.
According to social cognitive theory, the environment is not a single, unchanging object. According to Bandura, its structures are classified into three types. They
are divided into three categories: 1) imposed, 2) selected, and 3) constructed environment. It further demonstrates that humans are active information processors
(Bandura, 1977, 1997). People are forced to live in an enforced physical and sociostructural environment, whether they like it or not, regardless of their preferences.
Individuals have little control over their presence, but they have some power over
how they interpret and react to it (Bandura, 1989, 1991). The environment is mostly
a collection of potentialities whose rewarding and punishing elements do not manifest themselves until the environment is activated through proper courses of action.
The behavior of individuals determines which part of the prospective environment
becomes the professional atmosphere. The selected atmosphere comprises the individuals, activities, and situations (e.g., Bandura, 2005; Bandura et al., 2003). Human
beings learn from social contexts and institutional systems through their productive
activities. The constructed environments do not exist in a state of capability that
must be selected and activated before being used (Bandura, 1999). Determinism is
about relationships that influence human cognition in both hard and soft forms. It
assumes that if an observer knows enough about an object or person, they can predict their every move (e.g., Marmot, 2005; Sappington, 1990)
Sommers (2010) noted that the topic of Free Will is the one that has attracted the
most attention from experimental philosophers. It can unfold ordinary intuitions and
psychological mechanisms that underlie these intuitions under situations or subjects
with the hope of contextual learning. Moral responsibility, according to philosophy,
is the responsibility for one’s actions and the repercussions of those actions in social
relationships. Academics must keep an open mind to others’ intuitions and beliefs if
they want to discover the truth about Free Will and moral responsibility for actions
and deliberate decisions (Pailhès & Kuhn, 2021). Free will affects an individual, a
group, or the entire society. It shapes the actions or inactions of another individual is
the general definition of societal injury, even if blame is to be justified (Sie, 2021).
Hence, this article presents a taxonomy of chance and choice power under psychological positive vs. negative influence.
Increasing research from psychology reveals that human belief in Free Will significantly impacts individual decisions and behavior. Scientists contend that these
consequences may result from a weakened sense of control and power that comes
with the belief that one can make decisions. Like this, people may also feel lower
social decisions on behalf of their actions as time goes on. The relationship between

13

1104

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

Free Will belief and life outcomes may be complex. This study has combined Free
Will and determinism concepts from positive and negative psychology using scenarios between chance or choice. The thesis is that pleasure and discomfort are the sole
components of wellbeing and no other components. Free Will in scholastic success
may improve research performance compared to others who do not have it.
The argument over Free Will vs. determinism centers around how forces beyond
individual control determine human behavior using chance and choice scenarios.
Alternatively, suppose humans could choose between behaving differently; it could
taxonomize in reverse order according to negative or positive psychology. Some
essential definitions and applications are tabulated here for further clarity.
Free Will
Those who deny the existence of free will often allude to a philosophical definition of the power of
human awareness or soul. A human makes a decision regardless of brain processes or prior causal
events without regard to the consequences of those decisions. Free will believes that humans have
some self-determined control over behavior (Wolf, 1981). People have the freedom to choose whether
they commit a crime unless they are a child or insane. This freedom desire does not imply that human
behavior is random. However, it suggests that it is free from the causal influences of past occurrences.
According to free will, a person is responsible for their actions (Roskies, 2006). One of the critical
assumptions of the humanistic approach is that humans have free choice and that not all action is predetermined. The humanistic word for exercising Free Will is personal agency. Personal agency refers to
human decisions in life, the courses they choose, and the repercussions of those decisions (Hobart,
1934). It has been categorized into personal agency (e.g., libertarianism) and critical assumptions (e.g.,
compatibilism).
Libertarianism
Libertarianism is an economic theory and ideology that emphasizes freedom and rights as a basic concept. Libertarians want to enhance autonomy and political freedom, stressing free association, freedom
of choice, individualism, and voluntary association (Van Der Vossen & Vallentyne, 2014). Not causal
libertarians argue that free actions are merely mental actions like decisions or choices. The libertarian could rationalize violating someone’s inalienable rights by ruling arbitrarily. This Free Will does
not resolve the issue at hand; it only puts off the inevitable. There will be some libertarians who are
adamant that they cannot (Wollen, 2022).
Compatibilism
Compatibilism believes that despite causal determinism, humans are still free, morally accountable
agents when human causes their actions wants. Compatibilism denies that humans are free or have
free agency to make decisions or choices free of earlier influences. As a forced-choice response (Deery
et al., 2015), it is a chance to lead the Free Will. The dispute over free will often revolves around a
critical problem. If determinism is correct, we might have to give up on the whole system, including
the idea that we are free and responsible for our actions (Wallace, 2021).
Negative Psychology
Negative affectivity, also known as negative psychology, is a personality trait characterized by negative emotional self-perception. Pessimists or despondent are prone to adopt negative behaviors more
quickly (Sahlins, 2005; Wolf, 1981). It is also dangerous to have low self-efficacy in social cognitive
concepts (Bandura, 2011a). Negative psychology is often considered a dark trait, and stimuli are causing adverse behavior.
Positive Psychology
Positive psychology seeks to catalyze a reorientation of psychology away from solely fixing the negative
aspects of one’s life and developing one’s positive characteristics and attributes. Positive psychology
is determinism which has long been a source of fascination for positive psychologists to investigate
the nature of happiness. It is helpful for subjective wellbeing and psychological rehabilitation across
individuals and groups (Dunn & Dougherty, 2005). Well-being and satisfaction commitment emerge to
the desired future and take the steps necessary to achieve happiness (Bandura, 2011b).

1105

Determinism
According to the determinist viewpoint, all conduct has a cause and is thus predictable. Human behavior
is governed by internal or external influences they have no control over (Babbie, 2007). It has been
divided into two categories
Internal or soft determinism
Internal or soft determinism believes that all occurrences, including human actions and decisions, result
from causes but that Free Will and responsibility are compatible with this belief. Those who take a
biological perspective are the other vital proponents of determinism. However, for them, internal rather
than external causes are decisive. According to sociobiology, evolution influences a species’ behavior.
Genetic inheritance rules everyone within it, including moral responsibility, freedom of action, and
response to reasons with the proper sense (Pereboom, 1995)
External or Hard determinism
Hard determinism is a known notion that factors and circumstances causally determine human behaviors
and decisions. The cause of conduct, according to external (environmental) determinism, is outside
the individual. Those who adhere to the strictest version of hard determinism believe that we lack the
freedom essential for moral responsibility is confirmed. As a result, we are not only unrepentant, but
we are also immune from moral norms and ideals (Pereboom, 1995). The length of time between the
programming and the behavior determines a person’s moral responsibility would be unprincipled and
unethical. The agent is not directly manipulated around the action time; hence it is like a human situation. Although the actor is accessible in each compatibilist sense, he is not morally liable because of
idiosyncrasy, which is beyond his control but inclined to it naturally (Repetti, 2012)
Chance Vs. Choice
In strategy, “Chance vs. choice” appears to be intricately linked to achieving a strategic outcome. Causation is the foundation of strategy, based on the concept that events have both causes and effects. As a
result, perception-based decisions are taken based on how these choices affect the success and survival
of their firms. As long as humans are convinced that their decisions are their own, they can make them
(De Rond & Thietart, 2007). The term chance refers to events with the following overlapping characteristics—an absence of causes, certainty, and consistency in the action sequence and the conditions
preceding choice. When confronted with two or more options, our ability to decide is as follows:
The psychology of choice is the study of why we make the decisions that we do subconsciously, what
motivates those decisions, and what needs those decisions are supposed to meet.

The human engagement in under-determined opinions may be assumed to depend
on specific provisions, such as determinism or free will. Increased working capacity
increases the effect of conscious contemplation on decision-making and wellbeing.
Negative rationality metrics should, for example, systematically link to other theoretical freedom indicators such as positive vs. negative psychology notion. Therefore, it is helpful to seek interactions of manipulations in processes and features
related to rational decision-making styles, such as natural tendencies and positive or
negative psychological inclinations. Most psychologists use "Free Will" to convey
that conduct is not a passive response to external or internal factors. A purely deterministic or Free Will approach does not apply across all situations when researching
human behavior. It signifies no universal acceptance of Free Will and Determinism
yet established in philosophical debates. The negative bias affects things of a more
negative nature, like unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or negative social interactions.
It may become a reason for harmful/traumatic action to reflect significant psychological states of individual processes rather than neutral or positive things. The negative bias has been studied in various contexts, including the creation of impressions
and general assessments. The idea of freedom related to the available psychological

It can be perceived as a matter between chance and choice upon intervening with
wellbeing (Bouckenooghe et al., 2013; Martin & Sugarman, 2002). The soft determinism view holds that humans have Free Will but that their actions are constantly
influenced by biological or pressure, such as genetics or environment. The deterministic approach has profound consequences for psychology as a scientific discipline
and individuals. Psychology, as a science, seeks the same thing as biology - to produce laws – but this time to predict behavior. The agent is not morally accountable
because of the acts of the idiosyncrasy, which are beyond his control yet inclined to
it naturally. Although the agent is accessible in our compatibilist senses, he is not
morally accountable due to his habits (Houseknecht et al., 2019). There are various
constituents to well-being, including mental, psychological, social, emotional, and
spiritual components. Sen (2005) defines well-being as the freedom to make choices
and act effectively in various areas. Human freedom is a social concept that is intrinsically valued because it emphasizes the dignity of persons. It has fundamental and
undeniable importance for every individual. Moral dilemmas such as taking responsibility are, predicated on the concept of determinism. Reciprocal determinism is
a three-way impact conduct: 1) the individual (including how they think and feel),
2) their environment, and 3) the conduct. The links between these antecedents and
the actions they elicit can be represented by generalizations, like how laws describe
natural consistencies (Trakakis, 2006).
Determinism differs from the belief in Free Will, which indicates that humans
can choose to act in ways that are independent of previous events and situations.
The Free Will argument encompasses various topics, including moral responsibility,
freedom of action, freedom of will, whether it refers to a person, chance, or luck, and
the role of science. In psychology, determinism believes that efficient causal ancestors cause all human behaviors such as biological structures or processes, environmental conditions, or prior experience. Moral dilemmas such as taking responsibility are, predicated on the concept of determinism. There is a scholarly debate about
Free Will, a soft determinism, or illusion (e.g., Brezina & Piquero, 2001; Friquegnon, 1972; Gooch, 1994; Martin & Sugarman, 2002; Scholten, 2021; Smilansky,
2011; Trakakis, 2006). The Free Will argument encompasses various topics, including moral responsibility, freedom of action, and the role of science. Moral dilemmas
such as taking responsibility are, predicated on the concept of determinism.
Further hope, perseverance, and strength, which enable personality calculation,
are related to this topic (e.g., Duckworth et al., 2007; Maddi et al., 2001; Snyder
et al., 1997). This topic also joined the welfare scheme of measurement to evaluate and advise policy areas like international relations and economic systems. Other
external factors that are fixed yet have profound influence could also be counted.
Aside from jobs and economic systems, this study also touches on social, cultural,
psychological, and religious capitals, trust, and behavioral, psychological, and ethical considerations (e.g., Adler & Seligman, 2016; Cullis & Lewis, 1997; Dolan
et al., 2017; Dolan & Metcalfe, 2012; Helliwell & Huang, 2011; Luechinger &
Raschky, 2009; Van Praag & Baarsma, 2005).
The following taxonomy of human positive and negative psychology is based on
a comprehensive analysis of the literature and logical discussions that explain these
two approaches’ tremendous intricacies, shortcomings, and strengths (Fig. 1).

Law of Diminishing Return in Psychology: a Reason for Theoretical Integration
The law of diminishing returns states that if one input in developing a resource is
raised. Furthermore, or in contrast, if all other inputs are held constant, then the
output rise would eventually decline. When interacting with other people, humans
engage in emotional and social selectivity, which may play a more significant
role in their life. However, as individuals age, their need to be a part of a social
group may become less satiated (Luo et al., 2022). In other instances, the first
time we ride our preferred adventure at a park is exhilarating. The second and
third excursions provide plenty of escape opportunities. However, by the fourth
or fifth, people grew tired of it. Spearman’s argued that nothing could be escaped
from the law of diminishing return (Blum & Holling, 2017). After a significant
gap in positive psychology research, which is likely to be continued at a larger
scale, some researchers are inclined towards the strengths of negative psychology (Forgas, 2017). He used this to describe hidden strengths of the human mind

13

1108

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

and behavior through several arguments that emphasized the positive impacts of
negative behavior on human cognition.
Further pointing toward negative impact, his work promotes optimal efficiency, consistent with evolutionary theories suggesting the adaptive signaling mechanism of various
affective states (Forgas, 2010, 2011). However, both notions are unrelenting a combination in theoretical and empirical grounds. The complex nature of human relationships, continuously changing environment, and fluctuating feelings and thoughts have determined
its effect on cognition. Ivtzan et al. (2015) piqued to draw a contrary view on the interest
against positive psychology. Others advocate positive psychological benefits in social and
organizational behavior on a larger scale. This article, however, attempts to discuss both
concepts jointly. Both notions are unrelenting a combination in theoretical and empirical
grounds. According to Ivtzan and colleagues, the second wave of Positive psychology,
which they utilized, is presented as a balance to Positive Psychology.
The second wave of positive psychology research acknowledges the dynamic relationship between the positive and negative sides. The fact is that positive outcomes and
increased well-being can result from an individual’s positive emotions and traits. Covalence is the idea that many aspects of living and flourishing include good and negative
parts. Thinking dialectically about the good and bad parts of life, the appraisal principles and “ like ” come from the broader idea of synergies (Ivtzan et al., 2015). Positive and negative influences can affect optimal performance across various cognitive
and social tasks. However, both notions are unrelenting a combination in theoretical
and empirical grounds. We hope that scholars will embark on this idea to learn to balance a contrasting view of psychology. The implications of these results for contemporary affect cognition theories can further explore the practical consequences of these
phenomena of negative affect may foster better social thinking and academic success.
When a negative impact increases exposure to situational demands or enhances motivation, the positive effects of anxiety are most apparent. Since humans’ psychological well-being is complex and demands more profound knowledge, researchers must
not overlook the human strengths of adverse psychological outcomes. They should also
consider the weaknesses of positive psychological outcomes. Such advantages are not
intense, lasting, or weakening dissatisfaction with life yet help generate new phenomena
for deeper understanding. The Affect Infusion Model See (Forgas, 1995, 2002) aims to
link mood’s informational and processing effects with the conditions that promote or
impede effective influences on cognition and behavior. The AIM predicts that affective
effects on cognition are situation-dependent and may vary in terms of two characteristics. When positive, substantive, or heuristic processing is used, the likelihood of affect
infusion should be the highest. Focusing on positive effects may decrease and generate
learning disabilities among researchers. The degree of effort expends the transparency
of the knowledge quest strategy recruited by positive and negative psychology.

Discussion and Developing Propositions
Scenario-led review processes could guide the research of complex issues involving long-range dynamic processes in uncertain contexts. Accommodating and
comparing different perspectives may involve subsequent processes that make it

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

1109

possible to carefully revise assumptions and decisions, as each iteration’s learning requires. It is an alternative research analysis method that can forecast the
likelihood of an object. The repercussions of a situation occurring may be based
on the assumption that a phenomenon will continue in the future (Kishita et al.,
2016). The authors used literature review synthesis to present a taxonomy to help
and connect comprehensive readers of psychology research with relevant information to combine negative vs. positive psychology research. Researchers can
better understand how humans use their social environments as a source of information. It is possible to investigate the situational forces that greatly influence
human behavior. Social roles and social norms, by studying scenarios in social
behavior that are either pro or anti-social behavior (Al-Yaaribi et al., 2016). How
we would act in an unknown place or whether or not we would help a stranger
in an emergency are essential consequences of the situational factors that shape
our behavior. According to Eisenberg et al. (2006), prosocial behavior is a voluntary activity designed to assist or benefit another individual. Antisocial behavior has been characterized as intended to hurt or disadvantage another individual
(Kavussanu et al., 2015).
Developmental psychology can include actions and occurrences that may be
quantified using any applicable method or approach. For example, we have proposed that human psychology and intrinsic nature drive individuals’ tendencies
toward social inclusion or exclusion. People are free to act under their nature and
instincts because they are responsible for their actions and consequences.
This article posits negative vs. positive psychology, which is the subject of
change. In a situation, a man could use positive psychology in other acts with
a negative mindset provided that they use Free will or determination. Similarly,
someone with lousy intent might exhibit good enforcement behavior if they
intend to bring about change in their lives. Nevertheless, it will depend on how
the strengths and limitations of human positive and negative psychological intent
are being exploited and the circumstances in which their actions occur. Many
psychological phenomena fulfill another criterion: specific personality characteristics, affect, social, interactional, and self-related beliefs are permanent, while
others are variables. Human free will or determinism are examples of consistent inner psychological consistency. Psychiatric predispositions, inclinations,
long-standing states, and attitudes focused on the past and the future are essential
factors humans consult for determination and Free Will. This view asserts that
psychological dispositions, proclivities, long-standing states, and past and futureoriented sentiments drive desires and preferences.
Not everyone is on the same page regarding what could be compared to contemporary slavery in the workplace or a relationship. Slavery is no longer a distinct phenomenon. Instead, it is a psychological or moral set of principles that
allow political discussions in exploitations of fundamental human rights that are
not fixed to any particular occurrence. The afterlife of slavery’ is still evident in
the distorted life chances. It put other limited access to health care and education, early mortality, incarceration, and poverty that its victims face today (Davidson, 2015). Like many others in social psychology and cultural research, this
topic is challenging since much information is not being understood or disclosed

completely (See further Lawrence & Valsiner, 2003; Valsiner, 2014). The study
on both positive and negative aspects of psychology might benefit this subject if
it were to be proven true and allowed to reach its full potential.
The modern positive psychology study in the well-being movement aspires
to a comprehensive understanding of the human condition when its applications
come under consideration (Gable & Haidt, 2005). People’s ability to think wisely
changes substantially among contextual circumstances. Therefore, a reaction to
the same situation for individuals from the same society, culture, or religion can
be different, indicating a social fabric (Abbas et al., 2021c). Under the diversity
and inclusion perspective, leaders should be situationally aware of taking appropriate action (Abbas et al., 2021b). however, what makes them good leaders is
using their wisdom, known as strategic intent (See further Abbas et al., 2021d;
Fenitra et al., 2022). Only research can reveal how to protect thinking from bias in
changing situations where self-interest is unavoidable (e.g., Abbas et al., 2022a).
An ego-decentering cognitive mindset allows astute reasoning about personally
significant matters (Grossmann, 2017).
Focusing on such contextual aspects gives new light to the processes that
underpin wise thought. Its evolution aids in integrating many approaches to
researching wisdom and has implications for measuring and developing wisdomenhancing interventions. Wise thinking differs depending on the scenario, with
self-focused situations hindering wise thinking (Grossmann, 2021). Wisdom is
the ability to discern human virtues and shortcomings and determine how people choose to respond to or manage conflict in different situations. However, the
employment of positive and negative intent behind motives for action can provide
a glimpse of human wisdom to shape the reason for their action through psychological lenses. Reasoned action theory is a branch of psychology that explains the
relationship between attitudes and behaviors within a given situation (Montano &
Kasprzyk, 2015). Based on their pre-existing beliefs and behavioral intentions, it
is most used to anticipate how individuals will behave in the future. Individuals
decide whether to engage in certain conduct based on their expectations about the
expected outcomes due to the behavior. According to this theory, attitudes are one
of the most critical variables of behavioral intention and refer to the way people
feel about certain conduct. Two elements are essential to consider, 1) the strength
of one’s behavioral beliefs about one’s performed activity and 2) the evaluation of
the prospective outcomes. Positive, adverse, or neutral attitudes about a particular
behavior are all outcomes. It can involve evaluating individuals, subjects, items,
or events, among other things, since scientists define attitudes as an acquired
inclination to judge things in a particular way. They can be positive or negative,
but they may be ambiguous in some cases; therefore, reasoned action theory can
be included to explore these cases.
Considering that people’s decision-making should be understood as rationally
chosen responses to specific situations is a realistic option. People will not be
consistent if there is no strategy when change occurs; hence, the situation will
be a free-fall situation. It could be vain if they do not have a strategy to counter, allow or accept change; the change will take charge of everything. Individual
response to a troublesome scenario is likely to deteriorate. Suppose people do

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

1111

not exercise Free Will or determination. In that case, there is a slim likelihood of
inducing positivity and lessening toxicity in response to the scenario in society,
work, or personal matters. As a result, certain theoretical premises might be used
to perceive, examine, and construe the indefinite field of human psychological
strengths in various scenarios.
Triandis (1980) advocated the inclusion of other aspects, such as mindset,
enabling circumstances, and emotion, to allow a deeper understanding of human
behavior. Conditions that make it easier or harder to complete an action in which
someone is forced to absorb or react to a change circumstance could be linked.
The literature cited above dwells on the following propositions by keeping the
presented taxonomy in mind.
1) Negative and positive elements may exist simultaneously in human psychology,
and their circumstances during change and wisdom influence decision-making. The
indestructible and infinite nature of human psychological complexities prohibits
the application of a single theory to all contexts. Positive and negative psychology
include features that cannot remain constant in all situations. Hence this notion
may be realized to contribute to well-being once an individual a free will course of
action has been defined or chosen, as the law of diminishing returns demonstrates.
For this, research on Negative vs. Positive psychology is difficult to conduct on a
big scale in an exact direction, so theories of self-categorization and reasoned action
for personal choice or taking chances can help inform propositions. First, it could be
practical to assess applying these contrasting notions through the smaller segments
of society, such as social organizations and minority groups such as people working
in organizations. Then, researchers can gradually expand their horizons towards its
implication in complex models using both theories alongside.
a. It could be a reasonable proposition to instigate under which circumstances people
choose to remain silent. For instance, minority groups in organizations may accept
to choose work under exploitation if they are from humble backgrounds. It could
also be a subject to modern slavery, where injustice can happen. People choose to
remain silent due to the minor benefits they are taking from organizations.
b. It could be possible that people refuse to work under social, psychological,
or financial exploitation if they decide to raise their voices. The difference
between silence and voice thus could be a factor if they are leaned and concerned about their well-being.
2) An analysis of a few factors would increase insight into human behavior. Still, if
many factors are included, complexities will arise and make it more challenging
to unravel the mystery of human behavior.
a. One may use either the strengths of negative psychology or the weaknesses
of positive psychology in every given circumstance to keep things straightforward and understandable. One can arrive at a straightforward conclusion
employing reverse psychology by using paradoxes from both sides of the
argument.

13

1112

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

b. For all instances, reactions to every situation for individual reasoning action
could differ. However, once the weaknesses become strengths and individuals
choose determinism over Free Will, instilling choice over chance could be
decisive in changing situations.
3) Negative psychology is known for dark traits, but a reverse psychology technique could
help reveal its positive side. A more competitive point-to-point debate about the dark
side of positive psychology and enlightened modes of negative psychology could be
presented in the future.
a. Suppose well-being is realized, instilled, and valued through responsible
behavior. In that case, enslavement can transform people into resilient forces
in the modern world. They can fight against their own and others’ well-being
regardless of the circumstances.
b. If being quiet, experiencing emotional exhaustion, or maintaining psychological distance has negative repercussions, instilling ethically responsible
behavior could turn around adverse effects towards positivity.
4) Free Will Vs. Determinism can be assumed together, in contrast, and simultaneously for critical insight into individual psychological instinct. The reverse
psychology strategy could be beneficial for scholars to determine the natural
inclination of humans towards positive or negative psychology either way by
understanding reactions (Steindl et al., 2015).
a. Alternating between chance and choice could be helpful in better understanding the
conditions under which people choose to surrender as a conflict management strategy.
b. It would shed light on the circumstances under which they could refuse to let exploitations occur and stand up against any form of injustice against them or others.
5) It could also be determined in what circumstances a choice can be changed to
chance and its causal effects.
a. Chance and choice, if changed, may also affect the behavior to turn from positive to harmful to positive. A chance or choice can be differentiated using the
locus of control factor.
b. The external locus represents chance, and the internal locus might present a
choice scenario as a research strategy.
6) An emotionally drained mind can dwell into Machiavellianism behavior, putting them
under conditions in which psychologically they are distant from other people or systems.
It could lead to silent behavior that can generate more passive and complex behavior
that cannot be judged easily. Emotional exhaustion causes several adverse behaviors.
a. Ethically responsible behavior can detect a vast range of adverse behaviors.
However, there are some extra efforts they need to overcome silent behavior.
Quest under which circumstances silence behavior prevails and grow remains
a question of future investigation.

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1091–1122

1113

b. Since ethically and socially responsible behavior is a remedy for emotional
exhaustion, it could be vital to inform literature under which this particular
behavior grew too prone and vulnerable. It is therefore vital that no ethical
or confrontation of values take place.
7) Negative and positive psychology strengths and weaknesses are debatable. Suppose
positivity could become toxicity and negative could become the strength for humans. In
that case, an endless human nature in psychology may be dwelled on to the point of its
extinction. A state of well-being can deteriorate into a condition of ill-being or vice versa.
a. Negative affectivity is beneficial for one’s memory, ability to make accurate judgments, and communication effectively. Being in a bad mood can make individuals
more likely to treat other people properly and improve their ability to convince
other people of their point of view. Negative affectivity can also boost tenacity,
effort, and motivation to achieve one’s goals, informing well-being studies.
b. Positive psychology might be relevant to the scholarly areas of research that
are classified in this study. When a person becomes inflexible about themselves, the process of toxic positivity causes them to deny, minimize, and
invalidate the actual human emotional experience. When optimism is used
to cover up or mute the human experience, it risks being poisonous.

Conclusions
The literature helps understand positive and negative psychology’s importance in
psychology from a well-being point of view. It shows that positive but negative
effects have specific effects on memory, judgments, motivation, and social behavior. These results support evolutionary psychology hypotheses that affective states
aid in developing appropriate cognitive strategies for dealing with environmental
challenges. A positive effect is consistent with the assimilative, top-down processing of familiar, benign environments with pro-social behavior. Negative affectivity
promotes controlled, analytical methods based on externally drawn knowledge. The
negative impact is linked to accommodating bottom-up processing in response to
new or problematic settings. The negative impact is linked to accommodating bottom-up processing in response to new or problematic settings or anti-social behavior. Positive affectivity encourages simplistic heuristic approaches based on preexisting awareness and assumptions. Reverse psychology works in situations where
a sensitivity analysis is required, where converse psychology fails. Positive affectivity encourages simplistic heuristic approaches based on pre-existing awareness and
assumptions. Reverse psychology works in situations where a sensitivity analysis
is required, where converse psychology fails. Psychologists hope that researchers
could be benefitted from this phenomenon in psychology research. Respondents
must not be aware of this game because some people are more sensitive to reverse
psychology. For quantitative analysis, several scales are available and can be combined to find the hidden truth.

Abstract
In recent years, neurophysiological research has pushed the concept of free will
towards a reductionist interpretation, largely avoiding the concept of a freely willing agent. This paper explores the ongoing debate surrounding free will, highlighting the contrasting perspectives of determinism, indeterminism (libertarianism),
and compatibilism. It questions how individuals, particularly those adhering to
deterministic viewpoints, can ethically navigate a world defined by causal relationships. The paper argues that reductionist approaches struggle to account for ethical
responsibility and the human experience of making choices. While compatibilism
offers a middle ground, asserting that actions in line with one’s desires are free
and thus ethically accountable, this stance is scrutinized for its potential limitations
in answering questions about personal responsibility. Specifically, it is argued that
compatibilism may not be the ideal framework for a neurophysiologist confronted
with ethical dilemmas, thus leaving room for the re-examination of indeterminism.
Through this discussion, the paper aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding
of free will that incorporates both the scientific and philosophical dimensions of
human decision-making.

Introduction
An explosive growth of knowledge in natural sciences intrudes in virtually all
areas previously considered to be the exclusive domain of philosophy or theoretical psychology. Human mind and certainly human actions are no exception here.
And when science intrudes into this particular realm, it cannot disregard one of the
most thought-provoking areas of the mind’s activity, the will. Neurosciences have
achieved such impressive breakthroughs in studying the brain’s activity that they
believe their success to be boundless and consequently, they confidently claim that
free will does not exist, and the will itself is a phenomenon of the physical world
(nature) that fully obeys the logic that governs the existence of physical entities.
Despite the great variety of approaches, methods, and results in research into free
will we have to admit that the overall direction of such studies is mostly reductionist. Establishing determinations at the level of brain activity and the discovery of
unconscious processes in the brain that allegedly impact decision-making, independent events in neural circuits, and the body’s neurophysiological responses indeed
give serious grounds for such reductionist theories. Neurophysiology tends to avoid
at all costs the concept of a freely willing agent since, first, it does not fully understand how to fit such an agent into the physical universe and, second, does not see any
need for such an agent. Modern neuroscience sees a free agent and their free will as
a thing of the metaphysical past, the humanity’s curious fallacy rather than a proper
object of scientific study. Scientists increasingly declare their reductionist stance in
the matter of free will. In other words, quite a few neuroscientists are not ready to
agree that behavior of living organisms’ manifests deviations from the laws of physics. Neurophysiologists see action as rooted in physiology which, in turn, can be successfully described through the laws of physics and chemistry that, in their turn, are
strictly determined. What, however, remains ever puzzling is how we are supposed to
live if we accept the deterministic doctrine? What is the proper conduct for a person
who is convinced that their own actions and the actions of other persons are guided
solely by the only possible chain of causes and effects? In other words, how does a
person live believing that “nothing depends on that person and even if something
does, it is only to the degree that the person themself depends on necessity. How
does one “make decisions” when the person remembers each time that this is only a
figure of speech, that “decisions” are combinations of atoms, and consequently, there
can be “no other” decisions? And, most importantly, how does a neurophysiologist
who is also a determinist makes value judgments about themself and others if it has
never occurred to anyone in the world to make value judgments about those events
in the world that could never be anything other than what they are and that had not
been preceded by a real choice made by an agent? It would be ridiculous to say that
chamomiles having white petals and a yellow center is “good or bad” or “right or
wrong.” The chamomile had no choice in the matter, its appearance is determined by
nature itself. If anyone committed a crime, putting that person on trial requires admitting first that the criminal action could have been unperformed. Finally, any action
that involves a person assuming responsibility, for instance, signing any document on
their own behalf, appears to entail the idea of a free action, i.e. an action performed in
conditions when some other actions might have been performed. What should a neu-

13

918

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

roscientist think of the matter, what status should they ascribe to their own actions?
Below, we will attempt to consider the validity of such opinions and suggest to our
hypothetical neuroscientist another possible way of looking at the traditional question of whether free will is indeed real.

The Options of Handling the Free will Problem
Skepticism concerning the reality of free will is ancient and goes back to the debates
between determinism and indeterminism.
We see the world of nature as a causally uninterrupted flow of causes and effects.
For instance, an apple falling off an apple tree should, as a physical phenomenon,
have an equally physical cause: a breeze in the air, weight, physical impact, etc. We
cannot, without slipping into mysticism, point out a non-physical cause that governs
this process. For instance, we cannot say that the fall was caused by event X that has
no traces in the physical world. It would be tantamount to admitting the existence of
spirits. But it equally does not occur to us to claim that the apple fell because it had
made its own firm decision “to fall.” It we consistently adhere to this point of view,
we will arrive at radical determinism. The deterministic picture of the world comes
from the fact that the physical world can only be thought of in a non-contradictory
manner if it is causally self-contained. “Causal self-containment” means that the flow
of causes and effects must be, first, uninterrupted, and, second, homogeneous. In
other words, a physical effect must have a physical cause, and a physical cause must
produce a physical effect.
Determinism sees every phenomenon as having a certain cause. This concept is
based on three logical propositions that are hard to argue against:
1. Nothing can come out of nothing (nothing will come out of nothing, or ex nihil
nihil).
2. An effect cannot contain anything that was not previously present in the cause.
3. Real ontological uncertainty does not exist (the “excluded middle” law re-articulated: something either exists or does not exist, something either occurs or does
not occur).
Philosophical determinism that denies free will goes back to such renowned names
as Democritus and Laplace, and key proponents of determinism today are Ted Honderich (Honderich, 1993, 2015), Galen Strawson (Strawson, 1986), Derk Pereboom
(Pereboom, 2006) and Saul Smilansky (Smilansky, 2000).
Indeterminism (termed libertarianism in today’s philosophy of action) insists that
determinism cannot be a universal doctrine. In debates on free will, libertarians is the
name applied to those philosophers who deny deterministic postulates and attempt to
prove the existence of free will within the framework of an indeterminist universe.
They argue that there are at least some phenomena that the deterministic logic cannot explain (Clarke, 2002). The world cannot be entirely determined by the laws of
nature, it has space for spontaneity and uncertainty. Spontaneity is produced primarily by living organisms that demonstrate signs of will, namely, of an ability to

13

919

set objectives and achieve them. Indeterminists put forward simple arguments. First,
unlike non-living things, the so-called living organisms are far more difficult to predict and forecast. While we have virtually no doubt regarding what is going to happen
to a body with no support (it will gravitate to earth), we cannot always say where a
cat will turn upon waking (even if we know where the cat’s food source is). This is an
example of a naturalistic argument, when judgments about living organisms are made
from the outside, from a third-person perspective, when they are observed in the
same manner as non-living things. There is, however, a more solid phenomenological
argument that describes mental actions from within (although such actions can only
be verified privately, by the person experiencing this particular state). This argument
claims that each of us knows precisely (from within) that they are the author of a
particular decision. Phenomenologically, we ascertain every time that if our inner
world is real and not fictitious then no one besides the person doubting their freedom is responsible for their action or decision. Consequently, they are a truly free
being. We will turn to this argument again below. The principal figures here are such
philosophers as Carl Ginet, Robert Kane, Randolph Clarke, Timothy O’Connor. All
libertarian theories of free will rest, first, on accepting the possibility of indeterminism in natural sciences and, second, on proving that free will and determinism are
incompatible, and, third, on proving the existence of free will.
Finally, there is a sort of a middle ground, compatibilism, that believes uncertainty, in particular, the unpredictable human will, to be fully compatible with natural
determinism. This stance claims that freedom is defined in a very simple manner: it
is the human ability to act in accordance with their wishes. If a person did what they
wanted to do, it is enough to consider them free. The trick of compatibilism is that it
allows for compatibility with determinism. It does not matter that someone’s action
was determined by the entire setup of the universe. What matters is that the person
acted in accordance with their wishes and did not feel coerced. If someone does not
feel coerced, it would be silly to think up that coercion. Compatibilists believe that if
following one’s wishes without coercion is enough to deem human beings free, then
humans can also be deemed to be moral agents.
Historically, this was the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes,1 David Hume, John
Stuart Mill. Today’s leading compatibilism proponents in analytical philosophy are
Daniel Dennett (Dennett, 2004), John J.C. Smart (Smart, 1961), Harry Frankfurt
(Frankfurt, 2018), John M. Fischer (Fischer, 1995), Gary Watson (Watson, 1975).

Hobbes writes: “Liberty and Necessity are Consistent: As in the water, that hath not only liberty, but a
necessity of descending by the Channel; so like wife in the actions which men voluntarily doe: which,
because they proceed from their will, proceed from liberty; and yet, because every act of mans will, and
every desire, and inclination proceedeth from some cause, and that from another cause, in à continuall
chaine, proceed from necessity. So that to him that could see the connexion of those causes, the necessity
of all mens voluntary actions, would appear manifest. And therefore God, that seeth, and disposeth all
things, seeth also that the liberty of man in doing what he will, is accompanied with the necessity of doing
that which God will, and no more, nor less. For though men may do many things, which God does not command, nor is therefore Authour of them ; yet they can have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which
appetite Gods will is not the cause. And did not his will assure the necessity of mans will, and consequently
of all that one mans will dependeth, the liberty of men would be a contradiction, and impediment to the
omnipotence and liberty of God. And this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of that natural liberty,
which only is properly called liberty” (Hobbes, 1651: 107).

The three stances outlined above form the field of debates about free will, and
most opinions in classical and modern philosophy come under one of those stances
(Inwagen, 1983).
Let’s note their most significant elements. Determinism claims that explanations
should always be uniform. If nature is deterministic, then the behavior of any “body”
should fit into the deterministic logic. “Double standards” should be avoided for two
reasons. First, we will inevitably contradict ourselves trying to explain how it would
be possible for the universe to have such a phenomenon as free will. Contradictions
created by this assumption are connected with violating the three logical principles
of determinism described above. Second, even if free will does exist as a mysterious
phenomenon whose opaqueness cannot be pierced by scientific explanation, its action
will intrude into natural determinism and disrupt its uninterrupted action which is
impossible, according to determinism. Indeterminism, on the contrary, believes that
we will never preserve free will without extending freedom to the entire universe.
If people or some other living beings can act freely, then the universe should have
uncertainty that both precedes taking action and follows it. There exists objective
natural uncertainty of free action, and if free action did occur, it will break down the
chains of natural events. The logic of natural determinism, when strictly applied and
extended to the entire human existence, yields the concept of fate that does not allow
for any new events in the world; consequently, all events pre-exist. However, the idea
of fate negates the idea of personal responsibility. A brick cannot be held responsible
for its actions as they would happen anyway. Only if we allow human beings the true
freedom of introducing new events into the world, responsibility may be imputed to
their actions.
We see that both options constitute rather harsh philosophical dilemmas. Either
nothing violates the laws of logic and the picture of the world formed by natural sciences, but the free will is lost irrevocably, or free will exists, but we cannot provide
a logical explanation for it, while scientists cannot fit it into the deterministic picture
of the world. The alternatives here are rather grim: either we agree that free will is an
illusion and human beings are puppets, or we allow for the intrusion of chaotic events
into causal chains and thereby violate their consistency and inviolability and place
a powder keg under the entire edifice of physics and other natural sciences to boot.
This is where compatibilism comes into play believing its standing to be uniquely
advantageous. Compatibilism sees its forte in that, unlike the other two solutions that
ultimately produce dilemmas forcing us to sacrifice a part of ourselves, it proposes a
conciliatory solution and does not force us to abandon either of the sides. On the contrary, compatibilism believes that both sides, i.e. free will and deterministic nature,
can be retained. Thus we shall be able to satisfy both the demands of science and the
needs of common sense that requires free will to implement ethical, social, and legal
expectations concerning human behavior (Smart, 1961).
It is easy to see that when faced with the question “how can a neurophysiologist
both firmly believe in the absence of free will and consciously sign a contract certifying their free intent to perform a certain action (for instance, open a bank account
or buy a house)?” the neurophysiologist will find it advantageous to adhere to the
compatibilist stance. Their position becomes somewhat less stringent: they do not
blankly deny free will, but claim that the idea of free will needs to be rearticulated

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

921

so that nothing would violate the total determinism of the universe yet human beings
would still be held legally responsible, expect other human beings to be held legally
responsible as well, and to demand respect for their own and others’ rights and freedoms. Certainly, the neurophysiologist can claim they are a regular determinist. Yet
in this case, the contradictions in their stance are all too plainly evident. Saying that
we follow one kind of logic in our theories and another kind of logic in our everyday
life and routine is always worse than combining both logics into a relatively compatible whole. Therefore, the compatibilist stance appears more advantageous than
that of a pure determinist, and when a neurophysiologist finds themself in court or
having to sign a contract, they will likely declare their compatibilist stance. This is
the kind of position that, in its creators’ opinion, should eliminate the contradiction
between being convinced in natural determinism and believing in human beings’ free
activity. Below, we will attempt to consider this stance in more detail and to see if it
does indeed successfully eliminate the contradiction and if everything is well with
this stance.

Natural Determinism and Human Indeterminism: Is that Possible?
Compatibilism as “getting Off Easy”
Why is it so important for us to preserve free will? Maybe everything would be
much simpler without it: we could accept without any reservations and qualifications the determinists’ logically convincing arguments and save ourselves the pains
of searching for a more labor-consuming solution. Despite the convincing nature of
determinist arguments, human beings believe themselves to be free in their actions
and decisions. It is important for people to be free for a host of reasons.
First, we believe freedom to be a vital value. People dream of freedom and fear
losing it. Second, we understand that if people are unfree, they cannot appeal to their
own or other people’s morality and will cease to be ethical beings. We cannot either
condemn a person or thank them if their action was induced not by their own free
will, but by an insurmountable external force. We have grounds for praising or condemning a person for the very fact of performing an action only if that person is morally responsible for that action in the sense of the so-called basic desert. Third, our
life landmarks, in particular, planning for the future, will become utterly pointless if
it is discovered that our actions are determined not by ourselves, but by something
external, and our future is predetermined. If our decisions do not depend on us, why
do we even make any decisions? And finally, fourth, our opinion of ourselves will
change if we assume that our actions are determined by something external. We will
not be able to speak of “self,” or “I,” as it will be unclear what we call “self.” Is there
something besides my “self” that governs me, is that “self” of mine indeed my “self”?
The logic of freedom appears to structure four crucial dimensions in our existence:
1. the world of values and our ability to be guided by ideal principles and by what
is traditionally called the existentialist dimension;
2. ethics and our ability to be ethical beings;
3. our goals and our ability to be goal-oriented persons;

13

922

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

4. “self” and our ability to be this “self.”
Clearly, then, preserving freedom for us is absolutely necessary, but it needs to be
done in such a way as to not to disrupt the logic of determinism that also appears
perfectly indisputable.
Let’s consider, for instance, the famous Libet’s experiment that was intended to
disprove the existence of free will and its compatibilist interpretation. This is an
outline of the experiment: the subject was told to bend their wrist when they wanted
to. The subject had to look at a stopwatch and remember when the desire appeared. A
device attached via electrodes to the subjects’ arms allowed the researchers to measure the exact time when the arm muscle contracted, while an electroencephalograph
measured the activity in the brain’s motoric region involved in movement planning
and control. The experiment demonstrated that the readiness potential emerged first in
the motoric centers of the brain cortex and a conscious desire to lift a finger appeared
only 250 ms later. And only in 200 ms, an electromyography device recorded a signal
in the arm muscles. Therefore, the brain is about 450 ms ahead of the mind.
Determinists immediately took these findings as a confirmation of their theory.
What was their logic? The experiment clearly showed that the desire (impulse)
appears unconsciously in the brain and is realized only after a certain period of time.
For determinists, it means that the true decision is made in the brain, and the human
mind only follows it obediently. If half a second before the conscious decision to
bend the left wrist the brain “wanted” to bend precisely the left wrist and not the right
wrist, it is very tempting to say that the decision was predetermined in the brain.
From the point of view of indeterminism, this version can be disputed by pointing out that a wish does not coincide with a decision, although the brain will easily
manifest a correlate for any wish (a wish to eat, sleep, call a friend, scratch one’s
nose, etc.), but the brain does not “show” if the wish will be acted upon or vetoed
by the will. Without assistance from any devices, we know the following about ourselves. Wishes emerge within us “out of nowhere” all the time. For instance, in the
middle of an important business meeting we suddenly experience a burning wish to
check our email or browse the news feed. It is very tempting to interpret this wish out
of nowhere as generated by the brain. Indeed, we did not appear to be consciously
engaged in its generation and simply received it from outside as if someone instilled
it in us or ordered us to do it. However, then the “struggle” regime turns on inside
us. This is the state known to each of us: we are very close to yielding to temptation,
and then we almost “drag ourselves” away from it. This can go on for quite a while,
and we do not know the outcome of the struggle. Yet who is struggling? Is it that
very brain that some time ago simply “fired off” this accidental wish? Does it mean
that the brain cares about reputation, the opinion of colleagues, of the boss, and of
our subordinates? Do we not ascribe to the brain attributes of an agent, that is, do
we not ascribe qualities of a spiritual person to a physical essence? We clearly see
that every decision has a spontaneous and a consciously willed part. Which of them
assumes freedom and agency? It is clearly the second one since this is where a decision is chosen. If we want to ascribe both states, “spontaneous” wish and choice, to a
single brain, we end up with a strange entity that is both conscious and unconscious,
receives its states as blind impulses and can make conscious choices. But this is

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

923

absurd since the brain should either produce all of its states spontaneously or always
have a choice. However, it will only be a brain, i.e. a physical entity, if it remains in
the state of spontaneity. If we supplement it with the ability to choose, we will simply transfer the agent into the brain. The brain itself now will be the classical agent
choosing between several spontaneous wishes. Consequently, we failed to get rid of
free will and only renamed it “brain.”
Compatibilists, however, may suggest that we should not overcomplicate the situation and leave it “as is” claiming simultaneously that even if a person’s choices
are determined by the brain, as long as the person follows their wishes without any
coercion, the person is free. In other words, the origins of a wish do not matter for
compatibilists. What is important is the phenomenological state of the person taking
action. If the person acts in accordance with their own wish, there is no grounds to
deny free will to that person.
This logic is temptingly elegant, but leaves us somewhat puzzled if we take it
seriously. Let’s consider several possible objections we could put forward to a compatibilist neuroscientist.

Compatibilism Criticism: What is not Essential for the Feeling of
Freedom
One crucial objections against compatibilism lies in the compatibilist definition of
freedom. Is freedom nothing but acting in accordance with one’s wishes? What if this
wish is aroused in the brain by an outside force? Or it is generated by circumstances
that are independent of me: the needs of my body or other natural conditions? We
do not choose our wishes, but presumably choose to act on them or not. If we define
freedom as accepting and implementing our own impulses, we will lose the key element in the notion of freedom: choice. Of course, we can say that choice itself is
accompanied by a wish: I wish to make this particular choice, and not that one. In
that sense, any action will indeed be a realization of the wish to make this choice. It
is very important here not to get mixed up in the definitions or levels of wishes. It
is one thing to say that “a person wanted to smoke a cigarette and lit up” and it is
another thing to say “a person wanted to smoke, but could overcome their wish and
not light up since they wanted to abstain.” In both cases, there was a wish, but in the
first instance, the wish served as grounds for performing a non-free action (a person
does not even attempt to apply their will, they simply follow their brain’s dictate),
and in the second instance, it served as grounds for a free action (the person could
yield to the temptation or not yield to it, but they wished not to yield, i.e. used their
will as an organ of making choices). For instance, we can make a decision to perform
an action that we have no wish to perform, but we still perform it out of our sense
of duty. For instance, Kant’s ethics of duty envisages people as following their duty
freely, out of the decision they made to follow their duty, but we might have no sensual wish. This thought can be illustrated with a more routine example. For instance,
only following wishes (wanted to oversleep and be late for work and did so) can be
seen not as freedom, but as a kind of dependence on one’s own impulses that is closer
to animal instincts.

13

924

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

Given the above-stated, it becomes clear that defining freedom as following
wishes is counterproductive. We will constantly encounter opacities and ambiguities. Each time, we will need to specify whether we are talking about 1. a wish to
overcome a wish or a wish that emerged and went unopposed. For instance, we can
model a phenomenological experience of an allegedly non-free action (i.e. an action
that has no real alternative): if a tiger cannot help chasing an antelope, does it mean
the tiger will not wish to chase an antelope? In this case, the action is non-free, but is
accompanied by a wish. The action is performed since it can be but performed. We
can give a similar argument for an action that is not performed because it cannot be
performed. For instance, a person knows they cannot fly like a bird (using wings),
we phenomenologically know this experience as inaccessible. It does not mean,
however, that I cannot wish for it. Again, wishing is present where there is no real
opportunity. Is then phenomenological feeling of wishing essential for the feeling of
freedom, or even if it is essential, is it sufficient? We can say that what is essential is
another feeling: feeling able to perform a different action. The option of performing
a different action may involve both following and non-following a wish experienced
in a specific moment in time. In offering such a definition, we can insist on entirely
eliminating the feeling of wishing from the definition of freedom. However, if we
think that such a demand would be too radical, a softer version of the argument could
look like eliminating “wishing” from the substantial definition of freedom. Indeed,
we can say that at every moment in time, performing an action corresponds to an
intentional desire. That is, even if I substitute one wish for another one, I still follow
some wish. This is compatibilism’s main trump card: by vetoing our wish to smoke
or eat another ice cream, we should wish to do it, i.e. to wish the very act of vetoing.
This is a consideration we may agree with, but it requires one important qualification:
the feeling of wishing may form part of the feeling of freedom, but not as an essential
determinant of freedom. Since even if there is no veto, the feeling of wishing is not
going anywhere. The idea of “wishing” confuses us in that it does not allow us to see
the difference between wishes accompanying an action that has no alternatives and
wishes accompanying an action that does. Therefore, it would probably be expedient
to specify that what is essential for the feeling of freedom is precisely the feeling of
an alternative being truly accessible to the acting agent (the option of performing a
different action).
Additionally, wishes themselves may be of very different orders. For instance, I
can say “I really want a second ice cream, but I also want to lose weight, so I will not
eat it.” Which wish should constitute a component of a free action, the first one or the
second one? The logic of compatibilism will apparently claim that it is the wish that
immediately preceded the action, that is, “not to eat.” But what do we do then with
prior wishes, especially if the wish “not to eat” is built upon the wish “to eat” and
consciously presupposes it? The number of levels can clearly grow manifold: “1. I
want to eat, 1. I want to lose weight = not eating, 3. but I will still wish to want to eat.”
Each time we only take into account the latest wish before our action, we devalue
the entire preceding chain of levels that makes the final decision meaningful. And
if we take the entire chain into account, it did have states when our latest wish was
not desired. Therefore, we can state that, in contrast to the compatibilist claim, freedom should be directly phenomenologically experienced as a choice. If the choice is

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

925

accompanied by a feeling of desire, we should not see them as identical. In the context of these processes’ immediate neurophysiology, we can say that if a wish can be
registered in the brain (as manifested in the brain’s neural activity of “wanting”), then
the choice itself apparently cannot be seen in the brain. This is why this is easier for
a physiologist to focus on wishes that have correlates in the brain, but this definition
produces the confusion described above.
Therefore, if the subjective feeling of a wish or intent is indeed a requisite condition of freedom, it is not a sufficient condition. We also need to presuppose that
events in the world can take truly alternative courses that will guarantee an agent a
free choice. The world must have real uncertainty concerning the choice the agent
will make, and only in this case will the responsibility lie with the agent and not with
the world. Defining freedom via ontological instead of psychological aspect appears
to be more justified. We can talk about freedom when a true uncertainty does indeed
correspond to a particular choice. This is indeterminists’ traditional objection against
compatibilism. Indeterminists are concerned with the ontological aspect of choice.
It is not the matter of the agent of choice following some feeling of theirs either
phenomenologically or psychologically. A true uncertainty should correspond of this
feeling, otherwise, the feeling alone may prove to be a deception, a false freedom.

Compatibilism Criticism: What is Essential for the Feeling of
Freedom?
Yet if we do presume free will in ourselves, which intuitions prompt us to do so?
We seem to feel that physical events resulting from human activity cannot be fully
explained through physical causes. Physical causes are certainly part of the causal
chain, but they do not exhaust it. For instance, if I get up and close a window,
my behavior as a physical body (rising, moving, changing positions, etc.) can be
described solely in terms of physics, but how then will my decision be described?
Certainly we can refer to a physical feeling of cold my physical body experiences, to
the stimulation of nerve-endings producing corresponding stimulation in the brain’s
neurons. Is that explanation as rigidly bound with my decision as water boiling when
heated to 100 degrees? Will the decision itself be described in terms of neurons? The
answer appears to be negative. We understand very well that we can make very different decisions under identical physical circumstances. Additionally, the decision itself
is not identical with its physical (neural) correlates, just like the most careful recording of all physical changes in the body of a person eating ice cream will not allow us
to feel the taste of ice cream ourselves, i.e. gain access to the subjective experience as
such. What then corresponds to my decision in the physical world? Strictly speaking,
nothing does. It appears as a gap or break in the physical causal chain.
We speak of a free being as of a being endowed with the ability to unconditionally
launch causal chains. It does not mean nothing influences that being’s activity, but no
sum total of influences or no influences taken individually shape the cause of human
action in the same way we speak of the cause of a physical event. Human action is
endowed with a unique ability to start with itself and “out of itself” a certain chain of
subsequent events (Chisholm, 2014). Thus, choosing one partner can launch one life

13

926

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:916–931

scenario, while another choice would launch another scenario. Each of these event
lines is ontologically new and essentially impacting the fate of the entire universe
(Taylor, 1966). Therefore, we speak of a cause of a physical body falling in different
terms than of a cause of someone’s decision. A falling body cannot chose the trajectory of its fall while a human being can choose from a host of options.
We can recognize the meaning of this reasoning at any time. Even when we make
the simplest choice, we always feel we can prefer one option over another one; nothing directs human action as rigidly as events in the physical worlds are directed. Yes,
every specific decision stems from specific motives and impulses. But it does not
mean that these motives and impulses rigidly forbid another decision that differs from
the one that was made or even is its direct opposite. A human being is an entity that,
against any objective premises, can perform more than one action, and any of them
will bring a new event into the world.
Kane, one of today’s most renowned libertarians, points out the concepts of original responsibility, alternative options, and uncertainty. Original responsibility: an
agent is originally responsible for the appearance of some (event or situation) E only
if the agent originally, that is, voluntarily (or willingly) performed or did not perform
a certain action where the agent could have acted otherwise and which produced or
influenced the emergence of E. “Primary responsibility: an agent has primary responsibility for the occurrence of some (event or situation) E only if the agent is initial in
the sense that he voluntarily (or willingly) did or failed to do some act, in respect of
which he could have done otherwise, and which produced or affected the occurrence
of E.”2 In Kane’s theory, free action is only possible when there are at least two alternative actions and a choice is made between them (Kane, 1999, 2002). A person’s
will should experience the tension of both alternatives’ equivalence in the sense of
them both being equally possible, which is phenomenologically experienced as that
very ontological uncertainty within which the agent is making an arbitrary choice
(Kane, 1985, 1998). There are arguments “pro” and “contra” for every alternative,
and they are convincing enough to create an uncertainty and essentially maintain it
without tipping the scale. In other words, the burden of choice should lie precisely
with the agent, and not with a combination of circumstances. To develop the uncertainty idea, Kane relies on a series of appropriate philosophical theories: the chaos
theory and the quantum theory as he interprets actions of will as phenomena partaking of the fundamental uncertainty (Kane, 2005).
This is a perspective that corresponds to indeterminism: the world has freedom
because it has human beings in it, and this is a single world. The human being is the
entity that has the ability to unconditionally launch causal chains. It does not mean
nothing influences human activity, but no sum total of influences and no influences
taken individually shape the cause of a human action in the sense we apply to causes
of physical events. We speak of a cause of a physical body falling in different terms
than of a cause of someone’s decision. Indeterminism claims that from the perspective of a human being’s external description, absolutely any spontaneous scheme may
be set whose action cannot be calculated; internally, that is, as an existential entity,

927

a person is every second conscious of the emptiness of their own unpremised activity. A specific decision may stem from certain motives and impulses, but it does not
mean they rigidly prohibit a different decision that is directly opposite to or simply
does not coincide with the one that was made. The agent of choice is the entity that,
against any premises, can perform more than one action and any action will introduce
a new event into the world. Such an agent can be defined as a set of convictions and
preferences coupled with an ability to revise them” (Ekstrom, 2011: 371). The claim
of human freedom should be understood as a claim that a human being is capable of
everything: there are always some objective limitations, for instance, a human being
cannot walk on water or float in the air. We mean that any action transpires amid
equivalent possible actions and the choice in favor of a particular action is separated
from others by the void of a gap in a causal chain. We can always veto it ourselves. In
a situation where someone cancels our freedom of freedom we will always have the
option of canceling our own existence or at least attempt to do so.3
The essence of simple indeterminism is that a free action constitutes a certain
“event” that is not connected via causal ties with the agent’s motives and desires.
It just happens. Carl Ginet, another influential proponent of simple indeterminism,
speaks of a phenomenon that has a special quality, an “active phenomenal quality”:
a person phenomenologically experiences an action as something that the person
performs themself as distinct from passive experiences when something happens to
the person (Ginet, 1989, 1990, 1997). This approach generally appears to be quite
labor-intensive for neurophysiologists (Ginet, 2005) who are used to the third-person
perspective and not to the first-person perspective. What is the neural correlate of
choice, feelings of real alternatives existing or feelings of the action being performed
specifically by me? These phenomena are hard to see in the brain, while wishing is
far easier to see.
Indeterminism uses a causal connection to link free action with preceding events
in an individual’s psyche, internal dialog, motives, and wishes. What is special here is
the indeterminist logic of this process unfolding. The past is the cause of a free action,
but the past does not necessitate the action. Today’s indeterminists attempt, on the
one hand, to establish a free nature of action and, on the other hand, demonstrate its
connection to an individual’s motives. However, a link with motives here can also be
3

This is what Sartre said about it: “I am on a narrow path-without a guard-rail-which goes along a precipice. The precipice presents itself to me as to be avoided; it represents a danger of death. At the same time
I conceive of a certain number of causes, originating in universal determinism, which can transform that
threat of death into reality; I can slip on a stone and fall into the abyss; the crumbling earth of the path
can give way under my steps. Through these various anticipations, I am given to myself as a thing; I am
passive in relation to these possibilities; they come to me from without; in so far as I am also an object in
the world, subject to gravitation, they are my possibilities. At this moment fear appears, which in terms
of the situation is the apprehension of myself as a destructible transcendent in the midst of transcendents,
as an object which does not contain in itself the origin of its future disappearance. My reaction will be
of the reflective order; I will pay attention to the stones in the road; I will keep myself as far as possible
from the edge of the path. I realize myself as pushing away the threatening situation with all my strength,
and I project before myself a certain number of future conducts destined to) keep the threats of the world
at a distance from me. These conducts are my possibilities. I escape fear by the very fact that I am placing myself on a plane where my own possibilities are substituted for the transcendent probabilities where
human action had no place.” (Sartre, 2022: 92).

thought of as making a free choice: each time, we determine ourselves anew vis-à-vis
following or not following our earlier motives.
Compatibilism, indeed, notes a very ingenious construct. Namely, the peculiar
makeup of our will: we always do what we want if only we do exercise our will. Naturally, we can act without willing – this is precisely the case of us experiencing coercion and being forced to obey (against our will). But if we follow our will, we will
want to perform this or that action. For instance, we felt a wish to eat an ice cream,
but at the last moment, we did not do it. Even though we suppressed our wish (to eat
an ice cream), we did what we wanted: we suppressed a wish that was dangerous for
our weight. If a subject in Libet’s experiment wishes to deceive the experimenters
and does not do what the subject wanted to do (or their brain “wanted” to do), the
subject will, nonetheless, do what the subject wanted: deceive the device and tank
the experiment. The subject did not obey one wish, but did obey another. A human
being cannot operate in any other way. However, this reasoning contains one inconsistency. If we recall the reasoning of some classical philosophers, particularly Rene
Descartes, we will also remember that we can doubt virtually everything that applies
to the outside world, i.e. to the so-called empirical reality. The thing is that wishes
can be imposed, instilled in us, just like a certain sensual experience instilled by a
malicious Demon. For instance, it only appears to me that there is a window in front
of me, or it only seems to me that I am in a warm bath. Things may in fact be completely different. Descartes taught us that any contents of the mind may prove false
apart from the mind itself, apart from its form and a “cogito” with abstract contents.
The bath may turn out to be a hammock, and water may turn out to be lemonade, but
the fact of the mind attending to those fictions can be but true. We need to apply the
mind in order to doubt or deny the mind. The mind always self-restores in the acts
of doubting. How does this famous principle operate in a similar manner in the case
of freedom? This is how. Let’s presume that we can want what will occur without us
anyway. For instance, we can say that I only wanted what my brain wanted, therefore,
I obeyed the body’s physiology, a certain order in the world. This is where the fallacy lies. The argument is constructed in such a way as if there is an order of things
and then there is my “self.” And the “self” always wants what the order of things
prescribes. Proponents of compatibilism believe that it in no ways diminishes an
agent’s freedom. However, it implies that in addition to my wishes, the world has an
order of things that determines me. It means that I do not make a decision alone, but
something else inside me, not my wish, but someone or something else generates my
action. Therefore, the “self” is deceived thinking that that “self” is “self.” But this
is impossible since the “self” cannot be other, it is always only that one “self.” The
experience of “self” cannot be a deception, since that very deception is an experience.
To order to doubt the “self,” the “self” must exist. Similarly, a wish must be actualized by myself only, no one else and nothing else in the world can be substituted for
myself. And it means that this is my wish alone, and it has no other cause or source
in the world except for myself. I wish and I act, and this cause-action has no other
cause but me. And it means this action cannot exist without me. I do not simply join
something that already exists in the world (it would mean that the cause of my actions
is not my “self,” but something else), but I alone generate it in the world.

In consequence of this logic, a third definition of freedom should be added to
the two well-known ones, the libertarian “freedom is a choice out of many options
when the choice is not determined” and the compatibilist “freedom is following one’s
desires”: “freedom is following a wish that depends only on the self.” By freedom,
we mean such a state of affairs when a given event would not occur without myself.
I am the one who performs it, and not just merely wishes something that occurs anyway without me. Therefore, the very feeling of freedom is essential for the feeling of
freedom. We link an action with ourselves as its single source and find it difficult to
synchronize ourselves with some other source similarly to the principle of Descartes’
cogito: if someone else (or something else) attempts to perform my action (the action
I want) it means that is myself.

Conclusion
In this small rumination, we intended to show some difficulties inherent in the stance
that presupposes physical determinism (in particular, determinism of physiological
processes) as an integral part of the world’s description. The main difficulty that
arises here is connected with the freedom of will whose reality most determinist
theories call into question. However, we attempted to consider not only the difficulties inherent in overtly determinist theories, but also in less overtly directly determinist theories such as compatibilism. As we have pointed out, a scientist adhering to
the determinist stance can seek to rescue their position through resource to a more
flexible compatibilism rather than through referring to determinism that is quite pernicious and counterintuitive to the notion of freedom. The most acceptable way of
preserving both natural determinism and individual ethical competence, including a
feeling of responsibility, is the very popular compatibilism. Apparently, this stance
will appear most consistent for a neuroscientist as well. Yet is this theory quite so
perfect? We attempted to consider some of its flaws. In particular, we demonstrated
that the compatibilist definition of freedom as an ability to follow one’s wishes mixes
up the orders of wishes: wishes of the first order (“I want to eat and ice cream”) and
wishes of the second order (“I want not to yield to the temptation to eat an ice cream”)
where wishes of the first order may be vetoed. Additionally, it will still be difficult to preserve the possibility of making certain commitments, for instance, signing
contracts or checks, if the world is governed by rigid causal determinism. It is also
unclear how we can preserve in such a situation the role of an ethical being capable
of ethically judging their own actions and actions of other people. However, when a
neurophysiologist is a determinist and assumes the compatibilist stance, they become
a hostage to a no less ambiguous situation. As we showed in this article, the compatibilist stance makes it unclear how to continue interacting with an agent from the
point of view of their freedom if it is not the agent themself (but some outside forces)
who is responsible for performing this or that action. We attempted to demonstrate
that the cogito-like principle “I cannot not be I” can help us understand the principle
of freedom. In particular, when we claim (and before that feel) to be free, we testify
to the freedom’s self-containment: action is only free when it needs only itself to be
performed. Then, going back to the question that prompted this article “How a neu-

rophysiologist can perform actions that presuppose personal responsibility” we have
to admit that compatibilism does not appear to be a theory that can answer this question. And that, in turn, takes us back to indeterminism that directly affirms that free
will and consequent responsibility and ethicality are incompatible with determinism
inherent in natural sciences.

Abstract
Free will plays a critical role in human motivation. Recent advances in science
and technologies have had a significant impact on free will. They have raised serious concerns regarding the threatening effects of such advancements on perceived
autonomy. However, there is still a longstanding debate on the existence of free
will, known as the problem of free will. Philosophers have provided contrasting
views regarding the existence of free will and its relationship with causal determination and mental causation problems. These problems are related to the underlying dualistic approach between mental and physical factors. Similar to the
philosophy literature, the motivation literature is concerned with the problem of
free will and its influence on motivation and performance. Cognitive evaluation and
self-determination theories are the most renowned theories which assert the effect
of autonomy (i.e., free will) on intrinsic motivation. However, these theories have
mainly focused on the effect of the need for autonomy as an underlying driver of
intrinsic motivation. They have not been able to address the fundamental question
about the existence of actual free will and its effect on motivation and performance.
This is mainly due to their dualistic approach in the form of intrinsic/extrinsic motivation dichotomization. Motivational congruence theory addresses the problem of
free will and substantiates its effect by going beyond such a dualistic approach and
resolving the related problems of mental causation and causal determination. The
theory does this by taking a cotextualist and dialectical approach to the interaction
between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational mechanisms and context.

Introduction
Free will plays a critical role in human motivation and behavior (Ryan & Deci, 2022;
Wertenbroch et al., 2020). It is defined as a type of volition that endows one with the
capability to “choose otherwise” in a voluntary manner (Kane, 2012a) and is linked
with the ability to mentally influence the outcomes (Bernstein & Wilson, 2016).
Other constructs, including autonomy, self-determination, and choice are used interchangeably to address free will (Duus-Otterström, 2011; Ekstrom, 2012; Holton &
Will, 2006; Patall et al., 2008). In recent years, advances in science and technology,
including artificial intelligence and machine learning have made the issue of free will
even more crucial (André et al., 2018; Lavazza, 2022). These advancements have
created conditions that seem to threaten the individuals’ perceived autonomy and
free will in significant ways (Sunstein, 2016). However, there are still fundamental controversies regarding free will’s actual existence and effect in philosophy and
motivation literature.
In philosophy, there has been a longstanding debate on the existence of free will,
which is known as the problem of free will (Fagiano, 2022; Pereboom, 2022). Philosophers have provided different perspectives regarding the actual existence and
effect of free will on the physical world (van Miltenburg & Ometto, 2020). The free
will problem is linked with causal determination (van Miltenburg, 2022) and mental
causation (Batthyany, 2009; O’Connor, 2000; Wegner & Wheatley, 1999) problems.
Causal determination refers to the notion that physical events are causally linked with
one another according to the laws of nature and prior states of the physical world
(Steward, 2015). Mental causation, in contrast, refers to the ability of mental factors
to causally influence the physical world through one’s internal states, such as intrinsic
desires and motivations (Kim, 1995, 2007; Sartorio, 2016). It is the essential foundation for free and voluntary decision making and behavior (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2021).
In other words, for an act to be freely willed, the individual’s mind must have a causal
impact on its occurrence (Bernstein & Wilson, 2016).
Causal determination denies mental causation by assuming that mental factors are
separate and independent substances which cannot have causal effects on the physical world (Hohwy, 2004; Maoz & Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022). The problems of causal
determination and mental causation stem from the dualistic view on the relationship between the mind and the physical world (Maoz & Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022;
O’Connor, 2001; Swinburne, 2013).
Similar to the philosophy literature, the motivation literature has long been concerned with the issue of free will and its influence on human motivation (Deci &
Flaste, 1995). Most prominently, the two theories, including cognitive evaluation
theory and self-determination theory consider autonomy (i.e., free will) as one of
the basic needs that underlie intrinsic motivation (Patall et al., 2008; Ryan & Deci,
2022). However, these theories have mainly focused on perceived autonomy rather
than the actual one and reiterate its positive effect on intrinsic motivation (Deci &
Ryan, 1985; Fang et al., 2020; Ryan & Deci, 2000, 2020, 2022; Ryan et al., 2015;
Ryan & Vansteenkiste, 2023). In fact, these theories do not address the fundamental
question regarding the actual existence and effect of free will (Baumeister & Monroe,
2014; Feldman, 2017; Wertenbroch et al., 2008). That is, the problem whether free

13

will actually exists and influences human motivation and behavior is still unresolved
from an ontological perspective (Wertenbroch et al., 2008, 2020).
Motivational congruence theory (Hendijani, 2021; Hendijani & Steel, 2020, 2022,
2023) provides a novel perspective on the problem of free will and resolves it by
solving the fundamental problem of mental causation in human motivation (Hendijani, 2023). The theory does this by going beyond the prevailing dualistic perspective
in the motivation literature and considering a contextualist and dialectical stance on
the relationship between motivational mechanisms and the context. The interaction
between these motivational mechanisms and the context produces an overall motivation in a dialectical manner and gives rise to action (Hendijani & Steel, 2023).
In the following sections, the author first reviews the literature related to free will,
causal determination, and mental causation from a philosophical perspective. Then,
she explains free will in the motivation literature. Finally, motivational congruence
theory and its perspective towards free will is discussed. The author concludes the
discussion by providing implications for motivation and its related literature.

Free Will, Causal Determination, and Mental Causation
Free will is one of the critical issues in philosophy (Pereboom, 2022; Tierney, 2023).
Philosophers have defined and interpreted it in many different ways (Kane, 2012a).
In Descartes’s view: “the will (voluntas), or free choice (arbitrii libertas) … simply
consists in this: that we are able to do or not do (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue
or avoid); or better, simply in this: that we are carried in such a way toward what the
intellect proposes for affirmation or denial or for pursuit or avoidance, that we feel
ourselves determined to it by no external force” (Descartes, 1996; Pereboom, 2022,
p. 2; Ragland, 2016, p. 8). Ayer (1982, p. 15) provides another explanation: “When
I am said to have done something of my own free will it is implied that I could have
acted otherwise.” In Williams’ perspective, free will is the characteristic of something
in the form of “the effect that agents sometimes act voluntarily, and that when they do
so they have a real choice between more than one course of action; or more than one
course is open to them; or it is up to them which of several actions they perform (Williams, 1995, p. 5).” In a more recent definition, Kane defines free will as the condition
that one has the ability to do “otherwise voluntarily (or willingly), intentionally, and
rationally” (Kane, 1996, 2012b, p. 476).
There is a controversial debate regarding the existence of actual free will, which
is known as the free will problem (Fagiano, 2022; van Miltenburg & Ometto, 2020).
The problem of free will is tightly linked with the casual determination (Pereboom,
2022) and mental causation (Yablo, 2003) problems (Sartorio, 2016). Stemming from
Leibniz’ principle of sufficient reason, causal determination indicates that the physical events are causally linked with one another in a predetermined manner and therefore, mental events qua mental have no causal efficacy on the physical outcomes
(Steward, 2015). In other words, causal determination rules out mental causation
(Kim, 1995; Sinnott-Armstrong, 2021) and its role in influencing the outcomes in
the physical world (Bernstein & Wilson, 2016; Kim, 1993). The problems of causal
determination and mental causation arise from the dualistic approach towards the

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:932–945

935

interaction between the mind and the physical world (O’Connor, 2000, 2001; Maoz
& Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022; Mudrik & Maoz, 2015; Swinburne, 2013). By considering mind as a distinct, independent, and separate factor from the physical world,
such dualism creates the fundamental question about how these two distinctive and
independent factors (i.e., mind and the physical world) can interact and intermingle
with each other (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2021).
There are two main perspectives regarding the problem of free will, including
the compatibilist and incompatibilist perspectives (van Miltenburg & Ometto, 2020).
The compatibilist perspective argues that free action can exist even if casual determination holds. That is, an individual is still able to act freely even if the world is
causally governed by certain predetermined laws of nature. The incompatibilist perspective, in contrast, posits that free will is not compatible with causal determination
and can exist only if causal determination is defied (Clarke, 1995, 2010; O’Connor,
1995, 2001).
As previous scholars have argued, the compatibilist approach has several limitations (Duus-Otterström, 2011; Kane, 2012b). First of all, it mainly focuses on the
issue of freedom in general rather than the freedom of will. In fact, the main question
posed in many compatibilist arguments is related to whether “freedom” in general
rather than freedom of will is compatible with causal determinism (Kane, 2012b).
There are many types of freedom that are compatible with determinism and therefore, are not directly relevant to the issue of free will (Maoz & Sinnott-Armstrong,
2022). Some examples are freedom from coercion, addiction, compulsion, and political oppression which exist under determined conditions and are not related to the
problem of free will (Kane, 2012b).
Second, freedom in compatibilist view is mostly interpreted as the freedom of
action rather than freedom of will (Galeazzi & Rendsvig, 2022; List, 2014; Wertenbroch et al., 2008). Free will relates to the freedom of choice and decision making
(Batthyany, 2009; Donagan, 1987; Holton & Will, 2006; Libet, 1999; Pereboom,
2022). Since the focus in free will problem is about the freedom of will (i.e., an
internal desire and volition) and whether it actually exists in its ontological form, the
compatibilist perspective does not directly address this problem. In fact, focusing on
the freedom of action oversimplifies the problem of free will (Kane, 2012b). This is
partly due to the fact that freedom of action deals with what a person can do at one
specific point in time.
Freedom of will, however, is different from freedom of action. For example, under
certain conditions, the individuals might seem to act freely, but their choice architectures (i.e., sets) are previously manipulated so that they are implicitly forced to
choose a certain option or reach a specific outcome (Schmidt & Engelen, 2020).
Nudging techniques are examples of creating such controlled conditions where individuals are free to choose, but their choices occur in a predetermined and restricted
way (Bucher et al., 2016; Marchiori et al., 2017; Schmidt & Engelen, 2020; Thaler
& Sunstein, 2009).
In addition, freedom of will has a broader scope compared to freedom of performance (i.e., action). It goes beyond a cross-sectional evaluation of one’s action.
Rather, it includes long-term “self-forming actions” where the individual builds his/
her own capacity in the form of intentions, characters, and motivations that give rise

13

936

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:932–945

to action (Kane, 2012b, p. 539). In this sense, the individual’s will develops over
time dialectically and as a result of the interaction and tension between the person
and the environment. That is, the individual might act in a seemingly controlled and
restricted way in certain conditions, but such conditions are created by the will (i.e.,
in the form of motivations, beliefs, and characters) that the individual has developed
over time. For example, a drug addict might seem to be forced to consume drug.
However, his/her action is the result of the free choices that had been previously
made by this person and have led him/her to the current condition.
Fourth, in many of the scenarios used in the compatibilist perspective such as the
Farnkfurt style ones (Clardy, 2012; Frankfurt, 1969, 2018; Haji & McKenna, 2004),
the outcome is in the form of a categorical (zero/one or yes/no) variable (Murray &
Lombrozo, 2017; Widerker, 1995). However, the real-world outcomes (e.g., performance) are often continuous and the results might vary on a continuum depending
on the interaction between the individual’s will, external mechanisms and the context
within which they have occurred. In other words, in many cases, the individual’s
decisions and actions cannot be simply dichotomized into right or wrong. Thus, the
results are not clear-cut zero-one conditions and a wide variety of outcomes might
occur which should be cautiously judged about whether they are right or wrong.
In total, free will concentrates on one’s ability to make free choices and decisions
over the long run (Kane, 2012b). This type of freedom differs from other types of
freedom, such as freedom of action and cannot be compatible with causal determination. Considering these arguments and in line with incomaptiblist approach, it can be
concluded that causal determination precludes the causal efficacy of mental factors
and therefore, defies the existence and effect of free will as one type of mental factor
in the physical world (Anscombe, 1971; Clarke, 1995; O’Connor, 1995; van Miltenburg, 2022; Wright, 2022).
Nevertheless, the contextualist view resolves the issue of causal determination
and mental causation by considering the role of context in determining the causal
efficacy of mental factors (Maslen et al., 2009; Suárez, 2014). This view posits that
the causal role of mental versus physical factors depends on the context (Hitchcock,
1996; Menzies, 2003, 2007; Yablo, 2004). That is, in contexts where the underlying psychological or motivational drivers of one’s behavior are critical, mental factors are causally relevant in comparison with the physical ones. As previous scholars
explicate (Maslen et al., 2009), the contextualist perspective to causation is able to
address several concerns that act as threats to mental causation (Hendijani, 2023).
Contextulism resolves the problem of mental causation and its related problem of
casual determination by adding the role of context in the causal efficacy of mental
factors. Elaborating the causal role of mental factors in the physical world, contextualism implicates that mental factors, including free will can be causally efficacious
in certain contexts.
In line with the contextualist approaches to mental causation, contextualist views
to the problem of free will consider the influence of context in determining the causal
role of free will on mental and physical outcomes (Jaster, 2020). According to these
approaches, identifying the cause of a specific phenomenon is context-sensitive (Willaschek, 2010). There are several contexualist approaches to the problem of free will,
including the conversational (Feldman, 2004; Hawthorne, 2001; Rieber, 2006) and

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:932–945

937

social practical (Willaschek, 2010) ones. The conversational approach considers the
context of conversation as the medium through which causality is determined. For
example, in an ordinary conversation, we consider that one can act freely. Whereas,
in a philosophical context, we are usually skeptical about the causal role that one can
have in taking an action (Jeppsson, 2016). The conversational approach is mostly
a relativistic approach. It does not address the underlying problem of free will and
focuses only on the conversational context within which the causality is inferred. The
social practical approach, on the other hand, considers the two factors of social practices and facts as the defining elements of the context (Willaschek, 2010). According
to this approach, a combination of relevant social practices and facts constitute the
context within which the causality of free will can be determined. This approach
focuses on examining the role of free will as the “original” or “ultimate” cause of
one’s behavior. It takes a non-relativist and broad view to the causal role of free will
and is consistent with the incompatiblist notion of “ultimacy” of free will (Kane,
1996, 2012b), an approach that matches with the purpose of this paper. In total, the
contextualist views argue that in certain contexts whether conversational or social
practical ones, one can consider free will as the cause of a specific outcome (Jeppsson, 2016). Therefore, free will can have causal efficacy depending on the context.

Free Will in the Motivation Literature
Free will plays a foundational role in human motivation (Reeve et al., 2012). Among
different theories in the motivation literature, cognitive evaluation theory and selfdetermination theory are the most prominent theories that highlight the importance
of autonomy (i.e., free will) as an underlying driver of intrinsic motivation (Patall et
al., 2008; Patall, 2013). These theories take a dualistic approach to human motivation and divide motivation into intrinsic and extrinsic types. Intrinsic motivation, as
defined by these theories, is the inherent interest and enjoyment that drives one to
engage in an activity without the expectation of any separable external outcomes.
Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, includes the external mechanisms (e.g.,
financial rewards or positive feedback) that encourage one to engage in an activity
(Legault, 2020; Morris et al., 2022; Ryan & Deci, 2020). According to these theories,
autonomy (i.e., free will) is one of the basic needs that underlies intrinsic motivation
(Ryan & Deci, 2022).
Autonomy plays a pivotal role in these theories’ dualistic view (Koestner, 2008).
Accordingly, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations are often divided into autonomous
and controlled motivations as two separate and distinct types of motivation with
contrasting effects on different aspects of motivational and performance outcomes
(Brunet et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2012). Furthermore, many scholars have created
a measure called Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) by weighting and subtracting
extrinsic motivations from intrinsic ones to calculate the relative weighted score for
autonomous versus controlled motivations (Ryan & Connell, 1989). Many empirical
studies have found support for the positive effect of perceived autonomy on different
mental and behavioral outcomes, including interest and enjoyment, persistence and

13

938

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:932–945

effort (Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Patall et al., 2008, 2010), perception of competence,
creativity, and performance (Amabile, 1983; Iyengar & Lepper, 1999).
Despite theoretical foundations and empirical support regarding the importance of
free will on motivation and performance, theories in the motivation literature have
mainly focused on the effect of perceived autonomy and free will on motivation and
performance (Wertenbroch et al., 2020). In fact, these theories have not been able
to resolve the problem of free will and establish its actual effect on motivation and
behavior. This is mainly due to the dualistic approach that these theories take in
examining the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. According to
these theories, extrinsic motivation is inherently different from intrinsic motivation
and can undermine intrinsic motivation if it negatively influences perceived autonomy and free will. In addition, these theories give a higher weight to intrinsic/autonomous motivational mechanisms compared to extrinsic/controlled ones (Hendijani &
Steel, 2023) and assert that certain types of extrinsic motivational mechanisms (e.g.,
performance-contingent monetary rewards) can demolish intrinsic motivation due
to their controlling nature (Ryan & Deci, 2022). Such a dualistic approach makes
the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations difficult to discern and
interpret (Hendijani & Steel, 2023). Furthermore, it prompts the problem of mental
causation in motivation, which relates to the casual efficacy of mental factors (e.g.,
intrinsic motivation) on behavior as the physical outcomes (Hendijani, 2023). The
problem of mental causation, in turn, gives rise to the problem of free will, which
relates to the existence and effect of actual free will in shaping one’s motivation and
behavior.
Motivational Congruence Theory’s Perspective
Motivational congruence theory (Hendijani & Steel, 2023) goes beyond the dualistic approach to human motivation and takes a unified approach to the interaction
between the two types of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations (Hendijani, 2021). This
approach is consistent with the activity theory’s perspective in psychology and its
assertion on a bidirectional and dialectical relationship between the individual and
the environment (Cong-Lem, 2022; Mammen, 2017; Mironenko & Sorokin, 2022;
Roth, 2009; Vygotsky, 1997). According to this theory, the congruence between the
two motivational mechanisms and the context creates an overall motivation, which,
in turn, produces performance (Hendijani & Steel, 2020, 2022). The theory takes a
cotextualist and dialectical stance to the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic
motivations and the context (Hendijani, 2023).
Context plays an important role in the motivational congruence theory’s postulations. It is the environment where different motivational mechanisms including
intrinsic and extrinsic ones interact with one another (Hendijani & Steel, 2022). It
is important to disentangle the difference between the context and extrinsic motivational mechanisms. While extrinsic motivational mechanisms are applied in the context, the context is the medium in which these motivational mechanisms are exerted.
It plays a critical role on the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations
(Gerhart & Fang, 2014; Lehtivuori, 2023). One of the main characteristics of the
contexts is whether it is controlling or autonomy-supportive. Emphasizing task value

and importance, empowering and providing supportive and constructive feedback,
participating the individual in task-related and organizational decision making are
some of the elements of autonomy-supportive contexts. On the other hand, high levels of work load and work demand, job pressure and stress, and frequent deadlines
are elements of controlling contexts (Kuvaas et al., 2017; Oliver et al., 2008; Ryan
& Deci, 2000).
The theory’s contextualist approach postulates that the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational mechanisms depends on the context within which they
interact: In autonomy-supportive contexts, the type of extrinsic (e.g., non-salient
verbal and tangible rewards) and intrinsic (e.g., provision of autonomy and choice)
motivational mechanisms that match the context produce an intrinsic overall motivation. In contrast, in controlling contexts, the type of motivational mechanisms (e.g.,
salient verbal and tangible rewards) that match the context create an extrinsic overall
motivation. In both cases, the overall motivation either of intrinsic or extrinsic type
induces action and improves performance.
In addition, the theory takes a dialectical approach towards the interaction between
different motivational mechanisms and the context. The dialectical relationship
relates to a bilateral, dynamic, and interdependent relationship between independent
and seemingly contradictory elements (Collinson, 2014). A dialectical relationship
emphasizes the fact that while the interacting elements may seem contradictory at
the surface level, they are interwoven, mutually interdependent and reciprocal at
the deeper level (Clark & York, 2005). Motivational congruence theory’s dialectical stance posits that the two distinctive and seemingly contradictory motivational
mechanisms can interact with each other in either a positive or negative way. The
contradictory or complementary interaction between the two mechanisms depends
on the congruence between the two motivational mechanisms and the context in
which they interact.
The contextualist and dialectical position of motivational congruence theory goes
beyond the dualistic view on motivational mechanisms and therefore, resolves the
issue of mental causation both at the surface and deep levels (Hendijani, 2023). Consistent with the contextualist theories in philosophy (Menzies, 2007; Yablo, 2004),
motivational congruence theory’s approach resolves the issue of mental causation
and free will by explaining the fact that the causal efficacy of intrinsic (i.e., autonomous) motivational mechanisms is contingent on the context (Hendijani, 2023). In
autonomy-supportive contexts, intrinsic motivational mechanisms can produce an
intrinsic overall motivation and produce behavior. Whereas, in controlling contexts,
intrinsic motivational mechanisms are not be causally efficacious. Regarding the
effect of free will (i.e., autonomy), when the extrinsic motivational mechanisms and
the context are autonomy-supportive, free will would be causally efficacious. In contrast, when the extrinsic motivational mechanisms and the context are controlling in
nature, free will would be causally ineffective.
Furthermore, the theory’s dialectical stance resolves the issue of mental causation
at the deeper level by addressing the dualism between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Hendijani, 2023). By explaining the dynamic and bilateral interaction and
interdependence between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational mechanisms and the

13

940

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:932–945

context, the theory explicates how mental factors can have a casual role in interaction
with the physical environment as a separable yet complementary part of it.
By resolving the issue of mental causation, the theory is able to address the longstanding problem of causal determinism and its related problem of free will. The free
will problem arises from the issue of causal determination. Motivational congruence
theory rules out causal determinatiom by explaining the role of mental factors in
shaping overall motivation and performance. The theory explicates that mental factors (e.g., autonomy) are actual and causally efficacious. Autonomy/free will is the
building block of autonomous/intrinsic motivation. Thus, free will does exist and
influence individual’s overall motivation and performance.
Previous empirical studies provided support for the theory’s position regarding
free will and its causal efficacy (Hendijani & Steel, 2020). The results of one study
indicated that when administered in an autonomy-supportive context, autonomy
(i.e., free will) and extrinsic reward in the form of non-salient (i.e., non-controlling)
monetary reward positively interacted with each other and improved overall intrinsic
motivation and performance (Hendijani & Steel, 2020). The result of another study
showed that when administered in a controlling context, autonomy had no effect on
overall motivation and performance due to its lack of congruence with the context
(Hendijani & Steel, 2022).

Conclusion
The problem of free will is a controversial issue in the philosophy literature (Fagiano,
2022; Kane, 1996; Pereboom, 2022). It refers to the actual existence of freedom
of will and its causal influence in shaping the physical world (Kane, 2012b). The
free will problem is directly linked with causal determination (Steward, 2015) and
mental causation (Kim, 1993; Sinnott-Armstrong, 2021) problems. Causal determination posits that physical factors are linked with each other in a causal chain and
are generated by prior physical events and the laws of nature (Earman, 1986). Thus,
mental factors including free will cannot have casual efficacy in creating physical
outcomes. In this sense, casual determination rules out the causal effect of mental factors (i.e., mental causation) including free will in influencing the physical phenomena
(O’Connor, 1995). Thus, the existence of free will and its casual effect depends on
resolving the related problems of causal determination and mental causation.
Similar to the philosophy literature, free will has raised heated debates in the motivation literature (Wertenbroch et al., 2020). Theories of motivation, including cognitive evaluation theory and self-determination theory emphasize the importance of
perceived free will as one of the basic needs that underlie intrinsic motivation (Ryan
& Deci, 2020, 2022). However, these theories have not been able to address actual
casual efficacy of free will in creating motivation and performance.
This is mainly due to the theories’ dualistic approach and their dichotomization
of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Patall et al., 2008). Furthermore, these theories have given a higher weight to intrinsic motivation compared to extrinsic ones
and postulate that certain types of extrinsic motivation can undermine intrinsic motivation by negatively influencing perceived autonomy (Hendijani & Steel, 2023).

Considering intrinsic motivation as a separate and independent type compared to
extrinsic motivation gives rise to the problem of casual determination and the inability of mental factors in the form of intrinsic motivational mechanisms and free will
to influence mental and physical outcomes in the form of overall motivation and
behavior (Hendijani, 2023).
Motivational congruence theory resolves the issue of mental causation and its
related problem of free will by taking a contextualist and dialectical position on the
relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors (Hendijani & Steel,
2023; Hendijani, 2023). The contextualist perspective resolves the problem by positing that the effect of intrinsic motivational (i.e., mental) factors such as free will
and autonomy depend on the context. In some contexts, these factors are efficacious
while in other contexts they are not. Therefore, adding the role of context can solve
the issue of mental causation and free will at the surface.
However, the issue of mental causation suffers from a deeper challenge, which
is the dualistic approach towards the relationship between mental and physical factors as two independent and separate elements. If mental factors are inherently independent from physical ones, there is no possibility that the prior can influence the
latter. Motivational congruence theory resolves this fundamental issue by taking a
dialectical position on the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivational
mechanisms (Hendijani & Steel, 2023). According to the theory, free will is a mental
state which can interact with the extrinsic motivational mechanisms (e.g., reward) in
a dialectical manner. Their interaction creates an overall motivation which in turn,
produces performance. Hence, while the individual’s free will (as a mental factor) is
separate and independent from extrinsic motivation and the context, they are interdependent and can interact in a dialectical manner (Hendijani, 2023).
In total, the contextualist and dialectical approaches of the motivational congruence theory resolve the issue of mental causation at both surface and deep levels,
respectively (Hendijani, 2023). Therefore, the theory is able to resolve the issue of
free will as one type of mental factor which influences overall motivation and behavior. The theory’s approach provides insight for addressing the problem of free will in
broader areas, including psychology and philosophy.

Abstract
The article draws from critical psychology to discuss the rising debate on brain
determinism and free will in the legal domain. As free will also corresponds to the
context and culture, it can have both the public and private space of expressions.
The rise of neuroscience and its influence in the legal domain offers a holistic and
sociocultural meaning of responsibility. Even one becomes entitled to take free will
as a ‘necessary illusion’ in order to be in the zone of ‘moral as well as legal-social
life forming activities’. In the criminal justice system free will is not taken as any
kind of ‘necessary illusion’ but the conscious will and action of the person. This
further throw light on how the wilful control of any criminal act is a social act and
our brain is not separate from our collective will.

The discourse on neuroscience or any other socio-political and economic factors as
a determinant of action emerges in the sociohistorical contexts. Though everyday
activities and actions are prima facie taken as an act of will and seems to be controlled by the actor, some studies (e.g., Nahmias et al., 2014) presented participants
with a scenario that neuroscientists can predict with accuracy 100% of every decision
the person is going to make and it can be predicted ahead of time-based on the activities of the brain. The participants did not view the possibility of neuro-prediction as
threat to free will unless the evidence also indicated manipulation of one’s agency.

Most people recognize that just because ‘‘my brain made me do it,’’ that does
not mean that I didn’t do it of my own free will (p. 514)
It seems people also attribute free will to the agents activism against all the evidence corresponding certainly to the neuroscientific prediction (see also Rose et al.,
2017). Our taken-for-granted behaviour and assumption about others depend upon
our adaptation to the cultural system which comprises varieties of discursive roles
and practices. The person who finds uneasy talking in a group of intuitive and loses
his flow may be diagnosed informally and, in a sweep, firmly categorized by people
as anxious, asocial, shy, or autistic. Maybe the person is also deprived of his aptitude
to solve the problem in crisis due to this one single cause. What matters is the trend
of discourses uncritically adopted by the agents and the observer.
Society matters in both the expression of acts and the kind of determinism approved
by the legal domain such as the inputs from the forensic sciences and neurosciences
to build up the case for the legal agents. What is required for us to understand is the
consistency and genuineness of a person across time and place, both private and public. The discussion about questioning the meaning of private and public thinking is
important, however, these are taken, as the word suggests in the general societal terminology, and this is what legal domains also affirm. For example, if the person holds
the intention privately to act against the social norms but due to societal and legal fear
doesn’t commit the act, this kind of thinking doesn’t have any substantiation. His self
is socially constructed but the act committed in a private space or the public is a crime
and taken as a willful act by the law. The private space and private intentions are
two dissimilar things where any act committed even in the private space is a public
matter and hence a legal matter. Private intention matters in concomitance with the
witnessed behaviour (Ajzen & Madden, 1986); though the correlation between the
two must be established with the best possible corroborative techniques. Understanding the intentions of others’ actions is not just about inferring the person’s qualitative
state of mind which is proven to be difficult to understand, but it is the inference from
the observer’s subjectivity It is the intention of the observer which may have led to
the action inferred upon the other who already committed the action.

Rethinking Free will
Can soul, mind, free will and responsibility be real entities, or they are simplified
linguistic representatives of some deeper collectively known inferences? Free will
seems to be an assertion of one’s individuality. However, this depends upon the levels
of actions one has committed. The notions of freedom despite being considered to
be a individual enterprise is not beyond the social process. According to Eric Fromm
(Fromm, 1942),
The most beautiful as well as the most ugly inclinations of man1 are not part of
a fixed and biologically given human nature, but result from the social process
1

It is referred to human beings despite their different social identity and group belongingness.

1753

which creates man. In other words, society has not only a suppressing functionalthough it has that too-but it has a creative function. Man’s nature, his passions, and anxieties are a cultural product; as a matter of fact, man himself is
the most important creation and achievement of the continuous human effort,
the record of which we call history (Fromm, 1942; p. 9)
The current times had embraced determinism differently, as the division of humans
into a dual system of body and soul has been turned down as irrational in modern
times and a new meaning of determinism has incapacitated the old meaning of determinism. The modern time in the wake to redefine the meaning of responsibility in
law, making it more humane is working upon the pragmatic aspect of free will where
it conceptualizes free will on the features collected from the observations, forensics
details, linguistic categories, legal semantics derived through the legal informatics
and at the robust level from neuroscientific expertise. Free will thus is conceptualized more on the line of in-compatibilism as retained based on the past appropriation
of social symbols in our society, in terms of individual deeds and the equivalent
outcomes. Free will is in the capacity of the person to bring his/her rationality to
the forefront either in terms of controlling one’s action (e.g., Principles of Alternate
Possibilities) or acting out to the expectation of society. The intensity of punishment
aligned to the criminal act may vary across the culture depending upon how people
and judges see the actions in terms of the individual’s intentions. In other ways,
how intentions are constructed in the folk psychological understanding based on the
observed actions. Free will means nothing unless it is carried forward in action.
In the criminal justice system, free will is paramount which is taken as the reason
behind controlling or committing the action. Libet’s (1985) experimental findings is
sometime used as evidence that conscious will is an illusion and the person’s free will
if it exists may not initiate a voluntary act but may control it. Specifically Free will
may be seen as the ability to control one’s action which is not approved by society
and has past unpleasant sociolegal consequences. This corresponds to the notion that
one may be constrained by the neural determinism but at the same time the choice to
opt-out from engaging in a particular criminal act also exists. For example, a child
may not bully another child if he/she has witnessed some unpleasant consequence of
doing so or his actions of driving others have been transformed by teachers’ positive
intervention, like blurring the socioemotional boundaries between the two. This kind
of finding, as Libet stated, will also affect guilt and responsibility (p. 47). In the words
of Joaquin Fuster (Fuster, 2013),
As such, our brain is free to choose and to act, naturally within the constraints
of the nervous system itself and the world in which we live. Our choices and
actions, whether conscious or not, are informed by much more knowledge than
we consciously realize. In the absence of illness or compulsion, our cortex
selects at very instant between myriad options. Mostly out of awareness, it estimates priorities and probabilities (p. 110)
The deliberation on any event is a collaborative exercise which involves cortical
and socio-cognitive efforts. The perception/action cycle is not only a nascent brain

13

1754

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

epiphenomenon (Fuster, 213) but also an organism’s choice of action. The role of
the environment in making choices is an integrative exercise of organisms, which
can further be explained through the biopsychosocial and cultural paradigm. Without
the inclusive understanding of social contexts and cultural cognits, it is somehow
unfeasible to explain the human perception and actions. To the law as a system of
precedents, texts, and regulatory mechanism, it is also a cultural politics of affirmations. It is an unfeasible attempt to conjecture about the human free will without
resolving the inherent notion of incompatibility. Our self is a connective exercise of
our nervous system and ability to choose and adapt to the circumstances. However, it
may be called as an urge towards internal stability by adapting, adjusting and in other
words habituating brain, but it is also important to note that situation and context
are the facilitator of the free will of action including the intention. If in the history
oppressed has had adapted to the discriminatory norms, there would have no social
movement. Our brain is not separate from our will. If the person is diagnosed with
any neurocognitive disease the effect is clear in terms of interpretating the cause,
however, the challenge is when the person appears normal to the society and still,
he/she has committed any criminal acts. The normal person’s brain is susceptible to
uncontrollable behaviour depending upon the neurological challenges but how can it
be apart from the societal and environmental influences. In the context of asymmetric
power relationship, why the historically oppressed seems to be dehumanized. Can
this dehumanizing perception be simplified to some neurological deficit?
The first thing any inspector doubts is the actual cause of the event. It is another
matter that the method utilized to explore the cause may be lacking the rigour to handle, which may be nothing but the attraction of the cause taken as the true cause. Isaiah Berlin’s question about the meaning of liberty ‘What is it like to be autonomous
and in what capacity?‘, becomes important to understand the history of free will in
legal decision making and how determinism was either adopted in the compatibilist
mode or rejected altogether (Berlin, 2002), though some of the scholars placed free
will in an order of the sociocultural system under which it operates, as without that
order of systems, free will loses its meaning and that form the basis of legal norms.
We usually infer the cause based on effect. In the legal domain, we cannot start with
cause as we don’t know the effect. So, unless the effect is not observed we can’t go
into the cause. For example, just by seeing the people around, we don’t unnecessarily
fall into the legal meaning-making and consciousness, unless some non-normative
or unconventional behaviour is observed, someone commits any illegal acts on the
victim, and then causes are inferred, and placed in the arena of intentionality and reasoning. Though we attribute stereotypically that any kind of person may be causing
this effect based on experience but that is amenable to scrutiny. However, how our
assumptions are framed and what the dominant paradigms that shape our knowledge
are depends upon our ways of seeing law and its internalization. According to Kolber
(2017) “Over-reliance on the mechanistic causes weaken our intuitions about the
responsibility” and “free will sceptics say that the reduced responsibility reaction
does not go far enough” (p. 12). At the same time, Kolber (2017) further extended
the antinomies of free will as “the ability to freely choose X arguably implies the
ability to choose not- X. But if we cannot alter the forces that cause us to choose
X, then it is not clear we really could choose not- X, and it is not clear we have the

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

1755

kind of control over our choices necessary for moral responsibility” (P.13). He stated
about the duality that overpowered the law in “the laws dualistic view of mind and
brain” (Kolber, 2017; p.14). Kolber (2017) showed one recent study in which 75%
of college students in the United States deemed moral responsibility incompatible
with determinism. So too in the other three countries that were part of the study
such as India (72%), Hong Kong (63%), and Colombia (68%). Numerous important and interesting writings have been done on free will, moral responsibility, and
determinism (e.g., Fischer et al., 2007; Kenny, 2011; Baumeister, 2008; Baumeister
et al., 2010). The techniques have their value, and it gives life to the brain through
the interpretations of the correlations between brain activities and behaviour. The
neuroimaging techniques provides a sophisticated images of the brain in order to
understand it in best possible way, but that is offering more to the biomedical domain.
Even the fMRI used to understand the human brain lacks a firm scientific background
to detect lie or deception. The techniques are utilized along with the other evidential
criteria and looking for the consistency in the human brain, intention and actions.
The chances of conceptual error or reverse inference is high when brain is taken as
the only token for human behaviour aided by the not very much reliable techniques
(Poldrack, 2018). Inferring from Poldrack, the commercialization of these techniques
and rampant use does not guarantee the firm neural prediction even in the future.
In everyday life the social representations of the brain take a different hermeneutic
turn where what we mostly construct is something beyond the reduction to matter,
and embedded in the understanding of social relationships and discourses (see Luria,
1973). The discursive brain is a socioemotional and sometime political image of the
brain (see also Harre, 1994; De Vos & Pluth, 2016). Inspired by the Luria (1973),
Harre and Gillet (1994) noted,
We could gloss his whole approach as founded on the view that discourse and
usage, particularly of the tools made available in natural language, penetrate
deep in to the organizational structure of the brain, in the sense that in the
course of the acquisition of all sorts of discursive and manual skills brain structure is transformed to provide the machinery that an active human agent puts to
work in exercising those skills in a multiplicity of tasks of everyday life (p. 86)
We take forward our understanding of human conditions sometimes anchoring on
the images of the brain and our day today mobilization. In the case of free will as a
formal concept and as understood in the everyday thinking, it is difficult to separate
it from the sociality. The brain or in popular term the mind is intended towards something. It can be better formulation to see it in the ambit of social nature (see Valsiner
& Van Der Veer, 2000).

Social Responsibility and the Capacity to be Rational
The concept of responsibility based on the capacity for rationality connects with our
most fundamental convictions about human nature and human dignity. This also comprises our everyday experience of guilt, innocence, blame and punishment (Pardo

13

1756

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

& Patterson, 2017). Reducing the whole human agency to the brain mechanism
becomes simplistic to the humanness and may further collapse the idea of critical
integration of social science, science and humanities. Human agency and meaningful
existence are a matter of dignity. Though the dignity of humans is embedded in the
power context where the role of market, individuality, and capitalism has also framed
the notion of free will. In the current time law has witnessed a changed meaning of
rationality. Earlier, the duality of pure soul and impure body which devised the penal
code for punishment in the medieval times where more catering to the absoluteness
of the power of sovereignty inherited in the king where will and rationality of the
person were congruent with the sovereignty.
Free will or sense of freedom embedded in the social system and its understanding
built on the power structure. This is the anchoring point from which freedom can be
understood. Freedom is not anything in itself and asking about the existence of free
will may led to logical fallacy. It is the power of the society that is present around us,
makes us define what free will should be. Our brain is an adaptive system and even
the resistance we offer to any hegemonical or dominant social system is the result
of it. We look out the possibilities of expression and action which suits our agenda
whether it is conforming to any policy or vetoing from it. Foucault indeed explores
the relationship between power, societal structures, and individual freedom. In “Discipline and Punish,” Foucault (1977) examines how power operates within society,
particularly in the context of punishment and control. He argues that the power structures in society are intricately linked to how individuals perceive and exercise their
freedom. The idea that freedom is not an inherent quality but a product of societal
power dynamics is a critical theme in his work. Foucault challenges the traditional
notion of free will as an autonomous, self-determined force. Instead, he suggests
that the power structures around us shape our understanding of freedom. Individuals
may feel a sense of agency, but this agency is constrained and influenced by societal
norms, institutions, and practices. The concept of the body and soul is also relevant
to Foucault’s analysis. He discusses the historical shift in punishment methods from
brutal physical punishment to more subtle forms of discipline and surveillance. The
idea of the soul being saved by succumbing to the body’s punishment reflects the
transformation in power and control techniques over time. Foucault’s work encourages a critical examination of the mechanisms through which power operates in society, shaping our perceptions of freedom, control, and individual agency. However,
taking power as the uncontested entity is again a reductive approach to understand
the human agency which is construed in the collectivity. The social movements,
social identity assertion or taking it to new avenues of liberation is also a free will
that was taken forward. The neuroscientific claims as reductive and atheoretical does
not mean that interpretations of free will is also without foundation. In the Indian
context, the people believe in the God determinism or Karma has generated many
interpretations about the underprivileges as deserving, however, the rise of various
movements for social emancipation is a firm indication of free will against the Caste
and religious dominance, and power of hegemony. This is the new power of freedom
which Paulo Freire (Freire, 1970) construed as impowering and rehumanizing both
the oppressed and the oppressor. Leaving things aside as power will always be there

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

1757

and regulatory is never a marker of social change. Our brain is not apart from these
resistance and movements.
In the case of torture. it is also a kind of imposition of the will of the state or perpetrator to destroy the normative world of the victim (Cover, 1986). Though this does
not result in the elicitation of information. In the word of Cover (1986), torture is
“the deliberate infliction of pain to destroy the victim’s normative world and capacity
to create shared realities” (p. 1603), where “victims intangible normative world has
been crushed by the material reality of pain and its extensive fear” (Scarry, 1985). To
deal with the sufferer’s self (Scarry, 1985) the deliberate infliction of pain from the
state only incapacitates the bearer’s self and identity, as a form of the political prisoner or criminal, and overrides it with the determinism or a kind of new form of will
where things are not going to be in the victims’ favour and he/she must bear the pain
which is determined and imposed, without any control over one’s body, memory, and
self. The victimization of the other’s self is another form of understanding the clash
between determinism and free will. So, in one way determinism and free will are not
mutually exclusive and one can take the place of another depending upon the context
(e.g. the context of political ideology and the criminalization of the victim holding
different political orientations).
Foucault’s assumption about the people’s will in their participation in the game of
power (see also Teo, 2015) paradoxically impinges upon his version of resistance, a
form of free will in which power is questioned and the identity of the group becomes
more pronounced in offering veto to the will of the powerful. However, this agency of
the people to offer resistance was itself constituted by the power and any possibility
that it is an independent source of resistance was ironically regulated by the will of
power (Feltham & Clemens, 2003; see Hook, 2007). The interdisciplinary analysis
of free will may evoke varieties of situations in which it is possible to either account
for the society, history, and discourses as a marker of neural changes and responses
or only the receptive capacity of the brain to shape the meaning of behaviour according to the societal standards. We need to resolve this incompatibility of disciplinary
analysis so we can have a better understanding of the point of intersection where
these divergences of opinion meet.
The neuroscientists and psychologists’ atomism together with the broad assumption about human social interaction and discourse seems to be on different tracks to
understanding the meaning of individual, society, and law. How can we provide a
better picture of this by following separate tracks? We can say that compatibility is
possible between these tracks by redefining the meaning of individuality from the
sociocultural and group perspective. The link formed between action and the individual purpose is a societal assumption based on the collective selves based on which
theory about the intention is built up. The whole arena of the legal domain shows the
dominance of responsibility of individuals if he/she acts contrary to the established
will of the society. As we notice how any valid observation with proof (neuroscientific defect or insanity) changes the perception of legal categories which were understood uncritically through the singular framework.

Law, Free will and the Brain
Law is a formalized public arena where deterministic constructs hardly surpass the
everyday cognition of the legal agents who are freely willed, responsible, and conscious. The rationality of the person is symbolized through his/her normal acts. It is
abnormal to see the person acting abruptly and consistently across the situation defying the social norms. Even the action which is contrary to the social consensus or the
normal way of living can be categorized as insane, for example, any act of perpetrating injury or fraud. What matters is the perception of one’s action as freely chosen or
regulated by something obvious and tangible. Some of the researchers (e.g. Shariff et
al., 2008; Vohs & Schooler, 2008) speculated through the experimental study that it is
the belief of the people in free will that matters in their actions. The existence of free
will in an objectified and observable manner can be a myth and for some, it is a creation of the social and political system under which the acts of the person are labelled
as responsible and intentional. Even the belief about the existence of free will is not
naturally and universally adopted. Something seen as being natural and universal
can be the induced effect of the space and time under which a person makes sense
of his/her world. This is usually constrained or facilitated by the priming context.
For example, in one study people endorsed incompatibilism between determinism
and free will when given the abstract account of a deterministic universe (Nichols,
& Knobe, 2007), and in the other study, people endorsed compatibilism when given
a concrete account of a deterministic universe (Nahmias et al., 2005). To understand
the ‘intuition regarding the conditions for free will and moral responsibility across
culture’, Hannikainen et al. (2019; p. 2) examined people from 21 diverse locations
across the world. It was noticed that ‘despite lacking alternate possibilities, the perpetrator (people actions in different situations of alternative sequence and counterfactual intervener) was seen as acting freely by a significant majority of participants’
(p. 5). It was also observed that free will may not correspond to the lack of alternative
possibilities (Frankfurt, 1969).
In the mainstream legal studies. any action by the agent is a person’s choice. Even
in the case of Milgram studies (Milgram, 1974), the participants punished the accomplice for giving the wrong answer under the pressure of experimenter, but some has
also resisted and felt sympathy. In most cases people didn’t like giving the electric
shock but still proceeded on being asked to so. Since it was the experimenter who
was responsible in inciting the shock giving, the participant was also responsible. In
this case the victim was the passive taker of the shock because of the power of situation, the shock giver was no less the person freely operating at his/her will. It was
the authority who have the maximum influence in the creation of context of power
relationship. However, it is not that the power situation has one and all effect, and
saying no to the power (Fromm, 1981) also had a remarkable influence on the history of mankind. The context matters and the role of authority has major presence on
the individual choice of action, but as Fromm (1942) indicated that the strife to be
free from the forced submission or negative freedom led to uncertainty and positive
freedom. Free will exists and the brain adapts to the individual’s effort to choose.
This inadvertently led to the understanding of punishment and what it does to the
individual if he/she has committed some act considered as criminal. If the society

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

1759

creates a norm or standards of approved behaviour it is carried forward by the law
and it is in the social systems which either impels the person to engage in rebellion acts, criminal act or submissive act. These are autonomous acts, coherent and
intended. The patient having neurological disease may find difficulty to commit the
above mentioned acts. This shows that free will is a matter of choice and it embarks
on the social context. Nonetheless, the neurological patients may try to act but not
necessarily the controllability applies to them. The patient of Parkinson disease does
not have voluntary control a coordination and if by error he/she hits someone, doesn’t
fit to the intentional act. Thus, any action in a context depends upon the will of the
person. However, cultural difference was prominently observed in the import of
sourcehood for free will (Pereboom, 2001). In comparison to normal choice-making,
the case of killing someone, whatever was the intervening circumstances, most of the
people (American, European and Middle Eastern) attributed the blame and agreed
with harsher punishment on the perpetrator, as the actor is seen as exercising greater
perceived control over their action (Fischer et al., 2007). Though for Asians blame
and punishment were equally directed towards the perpetrator in deterministic and
free will situations, despite viewing the actors as an element of extrinsic and situational pressures. The belief in free will seems to be more strongly observed when the
observer perceives the exercise of control within the actor. However, in our everyday
work and social life, we hardly notice how much we are driven by subtle situational
cues. Neuroscience shows that our acts, speeches, body languages, and self-reflection
are all somewhere a brain mechanism (e.g. Churchland, 2002), as compared with
the political scientist, economists, and sociologists who advocate socio-political system, neoliberalism, capitalism, or socialist superstructure respectively (e.g. Travers,
2010). The sociolegal legal context advocates that law shapes society, and induce
societal morality among the social agents. Society is a matter of groups and communities which are based on hierarchy and hence the authority, characteristically, shapes
the legal theories and perspectives too (Nonet & Selznick, 2007). In any hegemonized space influenced by social orders and hierarchies, the actions are attributed to the
prevalent notions of rationality.
Neuroscience operates through its techniques, as these are in the discourse as a
post-event phenomenon. Evidence about free will, as it showed that its existence is
moderated by the culture, personality, situation, and cognitive reflection, especially
in the legal domain depends upon its usefulness rather than theory as such. Neuroscientific models are built upon their usefulness in some domains, for example, diagnosis of mental illness, dysfunctions in the bodily movements, or the legal domain
where evidence cater to the assumptions about the defendants as legally responsible
or not for their actions. The rise in the belief about the neuroscientific prediction
of human behaviour, still cannot be a force that seems to have a capacity to build
up a rubric of understanding human acts. Some researchers belong to the disciplinary background, such as biomedical, psychology, neuroscience, law, electrical and
computer engineering, and psychiatry (see Kiehl et al., 2018), and used independent
component analysis and machine learning techniques, to demonstrate the utility of
using brain-based measures of cerebral ageing to predict recidivism. Along similar
lines, the interdisciplinary connections of this kind are in the process of creating
predictive models based on the fMRI-based brain study of incarcerated individuals to

13

1760

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

give better treatment or rehabilitation inputs. Those working in the area of predicting
the criminal acts of the confined individuals depends upon the legal domain either as
a future member of the society or continue with their punishments. Nonet and Selznick (2007) noted that legal domains are in some way responsive institutions that are
not too flexible and adaptive to the dominant forces. They stated that “a responsive
institution retains a grasp on what is essential to its integrity while taking account of
new forces in its environment” (p. 77). Law as its role is practical and empowering
accounts to society.
The direction that laws provide in their judicial description is none other than the
moral codes of the social system passed from generations, established as structured
social knowledge. Law takes from society and uses its codes to regulate it. Free will
as it seems to be inbuilt in us from societal influences gets its meaning from the
legal influence which socialized us in the form of common-sense understanding. The
social agents get a clear understanding of social form, structure, and morality from
the law in action. So, the role of neuroscience as it seems to be taken by the law gives
it a codified meaning from which the society gets its discursive clarity. A set pattern
of use of technical knowledge shall be defined in the local space, critically or affirmatively. For example, even though people are not very much familiar with the actual
scientific use of fMRI but they inculcate into their everyday interactions the socially
constructed meaning of terminology, to make it familiar with their expression, meaning-making, and activities around. Thus, it is not to say that the socially constructed
knowledge of the techniques of brain scanning or any other biomedical terminology
alters the fact about them. The social meaning becomes more confined to the general
understanding of people. It is not that society will decide about the legal responsibility, but it is the will and autonomy of the law to determine and attribute the sanity
and responsibility based on the psychological capacity and mental state of the person.
The two conditions of giving penalty are (1) objective, the standard one in which the
person acts consciously, and the (2) subjective, comprising intention and negligence
factor as it is indicated in the model penal code (see Bertelsen, 2011). The legal
expert and judges investigate the evidence provided by the experts to make sense of
the case and conclude about the penalty.
Free will is influenced by the belief people hold but its authenticity is established
by the autonomy of law which has for a long time given space to the individual
strength and weakness to avoid and perform the act prohibited and sanctioned by
laws respectively. The question about where free will comes from and how the brain
operates to lead the person to act is pragmatically handled to the capacity and standard established by the law in consensus. We are not our brains and what we do is
done in the name of our will and not our brain. The brain is part of a person but it
does not act, think, feel, it is a person who do2 (see Harre, 2016). Tapping into the
philosophy of neuroscience, different generations of neuroscientist struggled with the
ascription of psychological properties either to mind or the brain. Bennett and Hacker
(2003) showed how attribution of psychological attributes solely to the brain results
in a conceptual confusion or Mereological fallacy. According to Harre (2016), “The
general form of a mereological fallacy is a sense-destroying attribution of certain

properties of parts to the wholes of which they are components, and of certain properties of wholes to their constituent parts (p. 633). Harre’s Hybrid Psychology (Harre,
2016) integrated neuroscience and discursive psychology, “showing that the brain as
a tool (studied by neuroscience) mediates what persons say and do (studied by discursive psychology)” (Brinkmann 2011, p. 3). Based on the Harre’s work, Brinkmann
(2011) developed an integrative theory of the mind stating the entire understanding
and confluence of brain, body, social practices and technological artefacts. The mind
depends on these essential mediators, whereas the basic ontological unit is a person
under observation. Further Gaete and Cornejo (2012) considered these artefacts as
important contested that the use of these mediators may be reductive and may run
contrary to the role of person as a basic ontological unit. Laws do not see beyond the
will but incriminate based on what is doable and not doable under the general capacity of human beings. Why did the person act violently this time and before, and how
do others holding similar capacity veto from acting in that direction? These are the
questions that make the definition of free will sanctioned by the legal domain a more
powerful buffer from the perspective which tries to position the universal notion of
free will.
Law does not seem to lock itself in the resolution of something freely willed or
uncontrollably determined by the causes beyond human capacities. It is another
matter of how the legal domain defines human capacities and where it draws its
boundary, in case it becomes open to diverse research from various social and human
sciences. Any explanations from the dominant sciences about the phenomenon under
observation claim the theory pertinent to their disciplinary domains. Similarly, for the
law, it is a myth that it will be changed by something claiming to be a dominant science or an authentic science. Law will see every new explanation from its perceptive
and pull under its boundary all other explanations in prevalence. The intention-action
debates had created more confusion than clarity in the social sciences and philosophical domains which further extended to the legal domain, though, the latter resolved
it succinctly without much falling into the confusion of an infinite regress of causes.
What is most obvious and intuitive both at the individual and collective level matters
more than an attempt to locate the final cause which does not have necessarily a linear
path, as defended by Wegner (2002) in his illusion of conscious will, and it is undecipherable (see Baumeister, 2008). If any cause is undecipherable, it has nothing to do
with the legal domain because it corresponds to the volatile category whose boundary is not clear; and the legal domain will be then taken for granted and undervalued.
To avoid this lack of trust, lower confidence, and anarchism, the judiciary looks for
obvious cause and has very little to do with the uncontrollable passive stimuli which
shaped the individual personality and subjectivity. The concrete cause is a necessity
for the judiciary to survive. Now, if the same cause is interpreted as determined and
as a function of an individual sociobiological system, the legal domain looks for
avenues where most individuals would have done or if the defendant could have done
otherwise. Not choosing the alternative options or choosing in the circumstances
when others would have avoided, activate the folk-psychological notion about the
person’s intentions. This seems to come naturally into the socio-legal collective process where most people unanimously infer about the person’s intention and conscious
choice-making, together with the removal of evidence which may have put the per-

13

1762

son directly involved into that choice making, which is contrary to the embedded
moral values of the society. This implies that liability is the given legal ownership for
the rationality of which the person is capable of behaving and further actions in the
social world. If this action is observed to be in the rational control of the person and
just not the functionally driven behaviour, liability is imposed based on the emergent
collective sense of responsibility on the part of the law and its protagonists.

Neuroscience, Neoliberalism, and Free will
Neuroscience is also the product of modernity and connects well with the rising neoliberalism, apart from it being the product of biological science (De Vos & Pluth,
2016). Like a biological science, established its scientific rigour to understand the
brain. Since neuroscience engage in understanding about human behaviour and thinking, its separation from the interdisciplinary social sciences makes it unique. The
models of neuroscience and psychology are based on different scientific questions
and the result is based on separate pathways. The sense of modernity and neoliberalism are not taken as exact socio-political values, but they also have one critical connection where the emphasis on individualism, objectivity, ability, and meritocracy
are profound. Modernity is the facilitation of new developments, industrialization,
scientific rigorousness’, rationality, technological advancement and conceptualization of human ethics and principles based on the new values, norms and practices.
It is not a complete rejection of traditionality, as traditions is also normative, but
something which is based on utility or usefulness and scientific approach. Modernity,
however, for oppressed social groups in countries like India emancipated them more
than the dominant traditional values. Neuroscience may either situate the marginalized as some beings having brain structures, or it may liberate the powerless from
the long historical construction of bodily oppression and reconstruct them as like all
other human beings having different sociocultural experiences. The aim was to construct a scientific and reliable view rather than laden with obscurity. In this process
to establish a replicable science, the social and cultural demands under which the
organisms shape themselves is also important. A functional and deterministic notion
of culture may show incomplete picture hiding the willful action. Here it is a groupspecific way of behaving and acting in the environment common to the species. For
example, it is quite specific for humans to opt for deception. The way of inferring
human nature in the pre-modern time in different cultural and geographical locations
as compared with the modern times was based on the different kinds of struggles.
In the case of the former, it was the struggle to place the scientific truth against the
theological, and in the latter case, it was something like falsification of scientific
theory with new evidence. The engagement of one person with the scientific truth
was individualistic in the pre-modern times as compared to the clash of novel ideas
in the latter case. The way invasive techniques or the mapping of the skull and brain
was used it gives a localized understanding of the brain structure. In that process
only, people got more knowledge about the brains distributed functions also. The rise
of neuroimaging techniques gave better picture of the brain and helped in improved
explanations. The anxiety among some social scientists and critical theorists is also

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

1763

about the rise of fascination with the neuroimages which may affect decision making.
It is eventually making space in the everyday academic discourses of understanding
human mind.
The systematic excursion of neuroscience into many domains from psychiatry to
marketing, which is happening at a larger scale now, and connecting to different
domains’ core areas, is legitimizing the dominant metatheory, and indicating everexpanding capitalism and the extension of colonization of the mind. It has acquired a
new outfit of methodological individualism giving more impetus to the neoliberalists’
outlook.
Though the critical legal studies are hopeful to keep a check on these ever-expanding medical and neural categorizations of free will, its method of checks is itself at
the risk of methodological and technological supremacy without much ado to the
inherent problem attached to their taken for granted aspects. The irony in which neuroscience presents a deterministic role of the brain; at the same time presents the
possibility of brain cure through various pharmacological and medical treatments.
The neuroscientists who visualize the brain and make effort to change for whatever
purpose like cure, change of mind, persuasions, and manipulations, somewhere paradoxically portray the system of power where the powerful operate on the powerless.
In the psychiatric domain, it is the mental patient and the psychiatrists, where the
latter is powerful and through rhetoric’s medical terminologies label the patients very
act. The neoliberal time is the time of individuality in the attire of community and
groups and it is also a kind of deterministic context under which group, communities,
and everyday taken-for-granted interaction patterns are doubted.
The debate about compatibilism and in-compatibilism (Fischer et al., 2007) symbolizes the powerful interventions of capitalism where ironically under the neoliberal
context, free will is entertained and at the same time regulated under its influences.
In the case of brain dysfunction, it is free will only which outperforms determinism
in the cure. Szasz (1974) rejected anything like mental illness because the very term
illness is a pathological terminology whose cause is in the objective presence of disease. This is not the case with the psychiatric portrayal of a person as mentally ill who
is out of the social structure and social norms and seemingly a danger to society. He
asserted that mental illness is not a medical problem whose objective platform is misidentified. It is the person’s self-conversation that is good enough to give the person
insight about his/her selves rather than any medicine which slows down the neural
firing and in no way symbolizes exactly the mental condition. His view was more a
right-wing libertarian view (Rose, 2018) which noted that mental illness is a metaphor and operates under the power dynamics of the socially and politically powerful.
Who has the legitimate right to infer about others without knowing the value, history, traditions of knowledge and identity? If any judgment by the jury or judges is
taken without much reflection upon the life of others, there is always room for error.
Here, errors are the wrongful placement or identification of others’ identities in one’s
prejudiced platform. This happens most of the time in the case of socio-economically
powerful. The engagement of law with neuroscience requires a critical rhetoric which
can understand the subjectivity and deep-seated memories of dominance and oppression. The effort to find a link between neuroscience and neoliberalism in the legal
context is both easy and hard. In contemporary times with more engagement with the

13

1764

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

hard sciences neuroscience has ever increasing interdisciplinary terminologies based
on metatheory. If the will of the society is neoliberalism, all the units and institutions
of society act as per that will in the name of individual will. It may be the possible
majoritarian enactment of a kind of societal determinism disguised as will. In any
case, the will persists. For example, if one wants to be in solitude which in any way
is not the general societal act, the whole agenda of remaining in solitude will be
observed as asocial. Law understands that societal will and keeps check on it. Like
psychological science, the law also has an operational definition of free will which
comprises an intentionally driven act.
Neoliberal times are the times of disguise where the subjectivity is channelized
through different modes. Indirectly this is the time which give more power to the
technologies that strengthen the powerful. The definition of free will add more features and shifts as the will of resource holders. All other efforts to neutralize science
is nothing but a political act of dominance. Free will is a matter of zeitgeist where
the prominent ideologies and perspectives plays a dominant role. As it was indicated
in the working of paradigm (Kuhn, 1970), people’s dominant understanding of science, oneself and others also matters. There was a time when behaviour mattered
more than what was happening in the person’s mind. The school of behaviourism
in the Western construction of action dominated many fields of psychology. Even
the neuroscience was more influenced by the brain-behaviour notions. Though it is
some or other times questioned, the information processing like meaning making and
cognitive mapping take prevalence and made it presence. The influence of behaviourism and its various forms of behavioural control pops up here and then. However,
it is also to be noted that actions/behaviour are often looked for causes within the
person, the environmental stimuli has remarkable influence in the persons conduct.
The emergence of intentionality which behaviourism considered as irrelevant has a
profound presence in the legal domain. Now, despite the mind is subjective, difficult
to interpret, and unobtrusive, we have full confidence that it matters. In law human
behaviour without the understanding of the mind leads to no concrete conclusion. A
few decades back people relied on self-confession and language to understand the
mind. As the current times demand with the rise of neuroscience, it is the brain which
seems to be scanned for deciphering the truth. However, it is always false notions
and logical fallacy to consider brain and mind same, since one is tangible other is
not (Uttal, 2011) and scholars aptly persuaded the everyday meaning making and
discourses to understand human mind (e.g., Harre & Gillet, 1994; Harre, 2016). In
both cases, the interpretations framed in the context matter. So, it was never the same
picture of something under observation but the engagement and interpretations of the
phenomenon through the perspectival lens of the agents influenced by the preferred
paradigms. Both act and mind complement legal decision-making. As noted earlier
(e.g., Brinkmann, 2011), broadly the psychological, social and behavioural concerns
can guide the neuroscientific discussions (Uttal, 2011) which simultaneously act as
an aid to the legal framework.
Law in both cases needs concrete and tangible observables. So, even the discourse
of mind needs to be consensus oriented in the legal domain. This is also a matter of
interpretation and consensus as to what is observable and how it must be interpreted.
In George Berkeley’s philosophy (Berkeley’s Tree Analogy), he posed the question:

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

1765

If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? This raises questions about the existence of things when not perceived. Something may or may not
exist based on our awareness or perception. In a legal case, this might imply that
the truth or reality of an event may be subjective and influenced by the observer’s
awareness and understanding. Similarly in a legal case, a witness describing an event
resembles the observer in Berkeley’s analogy. However, the interpretation of the
events lies in the hands of judges and legal professionals. The legal system aims
to establish the truth based on evidence and argumentation. If a witness provides a
description, it becomes evidence. The interpretation of this evidence and whether
it proves the defendant’s innocence or guilt depends on various factors, including
the judge’s understanding, legal precedent, and the overall context of the case. The
neuroscientific edifice is a determiner of intention and acts where the linear path is
followed where the brain is the primary mover but for the law, the primary mover is
the acts on the linear pathways. In the social science debates, linearity is a reductive
stance to be on the forefront of clarity rather than enmeshed with the varieties of variables and leading to nowhere. This reductive stance is very much embraced by the
legal domain in decision-making. Being prescriptive about what is happening in the
person’s mind or its content, doesn’t show anything but only what is communicated
through language consistency across situations, implicit and explicit associations, or
in the folk psychological understanding of those acts. Though rejecting what is in the
mind, social psychologist Forgas (2003) aptly stated that “it is not implicit associations but explicit behaviour that are prejudiced and discriminatory, and it is behaviours, not implicit thoughts, that represent a legitimate social and legal problem” (p.
255). It is also the case that the very act is taken as a cause behind the victims’ harm,
rejecting all other causes behind, even neuroscientific. In the mundane situation, the
spontaneous and taken-for-granted acts can be called a result of brain habituation in
a social context, and therefore, what others do in a collective context automatically,
becomes the sign of those automatically approved acts. The agenda is to show that
one acts in a context, which seems to be ecologically valid as others are also in the
process of restraining what is not approved and doing what is approved.
Neoliberal times are the times of individualism, profit, and merit but they are
also the times when something intangible regulates the whole course of society. The
notion of free will is seen in terms of globalization and the market regulation also.
Though the essence of free will is situated in the conscious act of the person, neoliberalism seems to nourish those acts more for a profit of the powerful and strict social
class divide than is seen among the masses. So, to be conscious of one’s actions is
a kind of global consciousness and if one is not able to be conscious of his/her act,
it is an effect of the imposed or ascribed will of the powerful. Similarly, the context under which the person operates is a conscious will of the person. If the person
loses consciousness in the folk psychological sense his/her responsibility becomes
the responsibility of the conscious society. Adam Smith’s “impartial spectator” who
is aware of both social norms and his/her motivation, acts as a kind of judge between
himself/herself and those with whom he/she lives (see Jahoda, 2007, p. 34). As noted
by Noam Chomsky, Adam Smith advocated that the people should be free without
any control of authoritarian institutions and they should not be subjected to things
like division of labour which destroys them (Chomsky, 2013). However, neoliberal-

13

1766

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:1751–1768

ism operates on individuals directly but through indirect socio-political waves. The
impact of societal values on individuals is immense and it also decides the choice
value of an individual. The automatic selection of available options out of many or
limited by the choice depends upon the objective availability of choices and one’s
position on the societal ladder. Vygotsky and Luria (1993) indicated that higher mental functioning is the consequence of the historical and cultural processes of discontinuities and continuities with new socio-cultural interactions and activities. Thus,
neuroscience cannot be apart from the social context.

Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding free will in modern and neoliberal times differs from
traditional and conservative periods. The incompatibility of experiences in these
times contributes to the plurality of approaches to understanding free will. Most of
the time, in everyday debates, free will is contested in a popular mode of thought, like
the dominance of the intuitive view, which constructs the notion of free will in terms
of wholesome individual responsibility, as compared with the reflective view, which
seems to be utilitarian, construct the free will in terms of contextual determinism. The
neoliberal turns in the history of law individualized free will. However, free will is
symbolized in the collective struggle against power also. The idea of choice-making
and rational human beings has been critically dealt with in many of the critical social
sciences, as it was observed in many situations that people resisted oppressive policies and suffered both physical and psychological injuries. In the universal language
of free will, there is little space for ideas that people are acting against their egotistic
ends, except in some social science and social psychological literature on altruism
and helping. How come the individual brains started operating as a singular brain
in a collective situation? Neuroscience has few explanations for this question (see
Lieberman, 2007). The brain is shaped by culture, but it is not passive. It can change
its structure as per the environmental demands. As experiences are also a matter of
sociocultural engagement, it may be conjectured that the human brain adapts itself to
the series of neural networking in some prominent area when exact or similar situations arise. It can be concluded that the researchers interested in the neural perspective of free will naturally adhere to brain determinism, and those who think it is the
social construction have a different approach to understanding free will. If, despite
the differences in the socio-cultural underpinnings and brain structure, the person
attempts to choose an alternative path, it is free will, as it happens in the opposite
cases where one commits a crime despite the availability of other options in the same
socio-cultural situations.

Abstract
In this introduction to a thematic issue dealing with free will, some possibilities of
free will in different physical, social, and technological worlds, as well as discussions of the possibilities are considered. What are the possibilities and limitations of
free will in various other worlds differing from our world? What are the possibilities and limitations of free will in different species, both in our world and in other
hypothetical worlds, including future species, naturally evolving, and artificially
modified? What are the possibilities and limitations of free will related to the development of AI? How can the diversity of free will levels in an agent be related
to possible levels (depth) of its self-knowledge? What can agents differing in levels
of self-knowledge know and think about the issue of free will? How do different
societies (social worlds) support and inhibit different manifestations of free will in
different areas? What is the role of hard neurodeterminism and “mindless neuroscience” in general neuroscience? What are ethical aspects of the questions, including
the initial one: “If a neuroscientist denies free will, how can they write a text of
voluntary informed consent and propose to sign it?”.
Keywords Informed consent · Free will · Psychology · Neuroscience ·
Determinism · Libertarianism · Compatibilism

The thematic issue dealing with free will had been initiated by my question asked to
a few researchers: “If a neuroscientist denies free will, how can they write a text of
voluntary informed consent and propose to sign it?” It is necessary to first clarify that
general relations of informed consent and free will are considered by D.M. Rousseau
in her work, Free will in social and psychological contracts.

Circumstances where individuals make conscious decisions for which multiple
options exist are arguably good examples of free will (Balaguer, 2014). In such
cases, individuals are attentive to their options, may seek to generate further
options via reflection and information gathering, and engage in thought processes not wholly determined from prior events. By making a non-predetermined choice, such an expression of free will depends on both the structuring
of decisions and the circumstances or environments in which they are made
(Rousseau, 2016, p. 213)
Relations of free will and informed consent in the context of patients’ decision making capacities and medical ethics are analyzed in (Zürcher et al., 2019); see also
(Meynen, 2010; Petruse, 2021). Thus, the issue of informed consent and free will is
being discussed by researchers. My interest is the consideration of such a special and
important case as the writing of informed consent by neuroscientists denying free will
and their suggestion to participants to sign the forms that presume free will.
Not all neuroscientists deny free will and defend hard neurodeterminism. Yet
concerning the other ones—neuroscientists denying free will, I saw a contradiction
between their scientific position (“free will does not exist”) and their research practice
(Poddiakov, 2022). As well as all the researchers working with human participants,
they must write texts for participants to receive their voluntary informed consent—
this is a requirement of ethics commissions, scientific conferences, journals etc. “Get
informed consent or perish” has become a part of the “publish or perish” principle,
and that is how it should be. Yet, if you deny free will, what do you think about
required practices of writing and signing voluntary informed consent forms? “Voluntary” means “done, given, or acting of one’s own free will”. Let us imagine that you
are a participant of a neurophysiological study. Before that, you have read a scientific
and popular book denying free will and written by a neuroscientist conducting the
study. What questions can you, out of pure curiosity, ask the neuroscientist giving you
the text of voluntary informed consent to be signed? The paradox can be strengthened
if the neuroscientist’s study is aimed to obtain more reliable data to deny free will.
This family of paradoxes can be discussed from different positions. For example,
you can believe in hard neurodeterminism and trust authors who write that our brains
make us do everything we do (see titles with words “brains make us…” and “brain
makes us…”). Then the paradoxes, for example, do not have ethical dimensions. The
neuroscientists’ brains (artfully) make them write such voluntary informed consent
forms that make participants’ brains sign them with the participants’ hands, and participate in studies. From this point of view, some people’s statements—that free will
does exist—are not much more interesting than exclamations of a parrot trained to
say: “This my statement and is evidence of my free will!” or than the printing of a
typewriter programmed to print this sentence.
(A disclaimer: perhaps this is not me but my brain who has been writing the previous sentence, it just makes me do it1.)

The paradoxes of neuroscientists denying free will seem promising from different points of views—including logical and semantic ones related to self-reference
paradoxes, cf. (Bolander, 2017). Yet, after receiving three articles from researchers
in areas of philosophy, neuroscience, and advanced technologies (Adomaitis & Grinbaum, 2024; Gasparyan, 2024; Ivlieva, 2024), I have understood that the articles
provide with opportunities to rise much more general (or even global) questions and
include the paradoxes in the context of these, more general, questions (problems).

Physical Worlds with Different Possibilities of Free Will?
(1) If our physical world is not the best one for the existence of free will, what about
some other ones?
Let us imagine that we deny free will because of hard physical determinism and do
not trust authors with the opposite positions—e.g. do not believe in Balls’ arguments
(Ball, 2021). Yet can we think that some other physical worlds are (theoretically) possible—the worlds making free will possible? Can physical worlds differ in their “free
will possibilities”? For example, hypothetical world W1 with N dimensions, physical
constants a1, …, ax, and laws r1, …, rt contains more possibilities (for more manifestations of free will) than hypothetical world W2 with M dimensions and physical
constants b1, …, by, and laws s1, …, su.
(2) Can we (or an advanced AI system, or us chipped with an advanced AI system
etc.) change our physical world to make it provide us with more (less) possibilities
of free will?
Stanislav Lem wrote about possible astro-engineering activity of supercivilizations changing physical constants and laws of the Universe. One can ask: can this
activity be aimed to change parameters of free will of living beings in the changed
physical world? Mammen (2018) gives a rigorous proof of existence of free will
based on the mathematical axiom of choice (see also [Poddiakov, 2019] for a review).
Mammen shows that free will is an attribute of living beings. Yet, one can try to
change this state of affairs to increase some parameters of free will (in some domains)
and decrease some other ones (in some other domains)—see (Adomaitis, & Grinbaum, 2024).

Development of Free Will Possibilities via Changes of Biochemistry,
Genetics, and AI?
Perhaps the midbrain dopaminergic system is free will’s neurophysiological basis
affecting self-forming actions, in Kane’s terms (Ivlieva, 2024). Self-forming actions
“occur at those difficult times of life when we are torn between competing visions of
what we should do or become” (Kane, 2005, p. 135; cited by: Ivlieva, 2024). “… in
cases of self-formation actions, agents are simultaneously trying to resolve plural and
“himselves” of a man getting his brain “callotomized, i.e. the two hemispheres of his brain are separated”
in a distant way by advanced robots (Introductory words), see also (Kowalczyk, 2021).

13

887

competing cognitive tasks. They are, as we say, of two minds. Yet they are not two
separate persons” (Kane, 2005, p. 139; cited by: Ivlieva, 2024).
If the midbrain dopaminergic system is free will’s neurophysiological basis affecting self-forming actions (self-forming in more general terms), can we change and
develop possibilities of free will in the diversity of dimensions via changes of biochemistry and genetics? Can we modify our biochemistry to develop possibilities of
our free will? Can we design brain chips not to limit but to develop possibilities of
our free will?
In consideration of these activities, one should agree with the following statement.
“By bringing the neurotechnological innovations into the world, neuroscientists not
only change the technological landscape but also partake in long-standing moral narratives about freedom, justice, and responsibility” (Adomaitis, & Grinbaum, 2024,
abstract).
It seems that different biological species (e.g. belonging to bacteria, jellyfish,
insects, mammals, apes) have different possibilities of free will. Here, I do not consider ideas that free will either does exist or does not, without levels and gradations
(Maximov, 2015). I agree with the statements: “The proportion of variance attributable to volition would be expected to vary across individuals, across behaviors,
and for the same behavior within the same individual over time. The capacity for
volitional control of behavior (self-regulation) emerges gradually over the course of
development” (Miller & Atencio, 2008, abstract). One can add: not only individual
development but phylogenetic too. “Initially, we thought free will was a metaphysical entity. Today, I am joining a growing list of colleagues who are suggesting it is a
quantitative, biological trait, a natural product of physical laws and biological evolution, a function of brains, maybe their most important one” (Brembs, 2011, p. 936);
see also (Baumeister, 2008; Dennett, 2003; Steward, 2015). Here, let me remember
Mammen’s mathematical proof that free will is an attribute of living beings.
In cases of different levels of free will in different species, can we (or an advanced
AI system, or us chipped with an advanced AI system etc.) design new species (our
genetic continuations or not) with higher levels of possibilities of free will and selfforming actions?
Thus, if the previous section deals with the questions about other physical worlds
(Universes) with different possibilities of free will, this section deals with the questions about the possibilities of other brains (or other advanced material systems) with
advanced possibilities of free will.

Self-Knowledge of Agents with Different Levels of Free Will, and Their
Communications
Issues of free will and agency are closely related (Hejlesen, 2024; Pleasants, 2019).
One can ask some important questions concerning this matter.
How can the diversity of free will levels in an agent be related to possible levels
(depth) of its self-knowledge? What can agents differing in levels of self-knowledge
know and think about the issue of free will? What will possible future advanced
agents know and think about the issue of free will?

13

888

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:884–893

We cannot answer the last question but can discuss the first ones based on lots of
philosophical studies of the issue of free will since ancient times, and on psychological studies of people’s beliefs about free will (Baumeister et al., 2011; Quinton et al.,
2023).
In this issue, D. Gasparyan considers the complexity of a person having wishes
of different orders conflicting with one another. She analyzes an amusing and understandable example: a conflict between wishes of the first order (“I want to eat an ice
cream”) and wishes of the second order (“I want not to yield to the temptation to eat
an ice cream”). (Another interesting type of conflicts between wishes of different
orders is a conflict between “I want < X > !” and “I want you to want < X > !”: a person
can want another person not just to do something but to want to do it. These wishes
can be conflicting in some situations [Indius, 2022)]).
Based on analysis of conflicts between wishes and other reasonings, D. Gasparyan
shows complex relations between determinism, indeterminism (libertarianism), and
compatibilism. “Specifically, it is argued that compatibilism may not be the ideal
framework for a neurophysiologist confronted with ethical dilemmas, thus leaving
room for the re-examination of indeterminism. Through this discussion, the paper
aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of free will that incorporates both
the scientific and philosophical dimensions of human decision-making” (Gasparyan,
2024).
In terms of agency, we can speak about agents’ beliefs about free will and consider
their communications concerning this issue (e.g. philosophical debates). The issue
of complex communications is not discussed by neuroscientists. I do not mean interpersonal neural coordination in participants’ pairs in joint manipulative activity like
completing a puzzle together (Fishburn et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2024), though it is
very interesting (and does not lead the authors to any conclusions about existence or
nonexistence of free will). I mean content and dynamics of much more complex communications. For example, I cannot imagine descriptions of philosophers’ communication in pure neurobiological terms (“the brain of philosopher A makes him write
the following arguments as a response to a text which the brain of philosopher B
had made her write two months ago, because the brain’s areas in philosopher A with
its activated neurons of kind…”). Also, I cannot imagine the article titled How the
Wright Brothers’ Brains Forced them to Invent the Aircraft. Or an article describing,
in neurobiological terms, a group of researchers inventing an experimental object to
study creative thinking and exploration (examples are in [Poddiakov, 2023, 2024]).
I would like to read these future neurobiological articles—with explicit conclusions
that free will does not exist.
The aspect of various communications in various social situations and environments seem important in the context of free will. Different societies (social worlds)
support and inhibit different manifestations of free will in different areas. Manifestations of free will which are stimulated and supported in some societies can be inhibited and prohibited in some other ones, and vice versa. “Just as societies may differ
in the extent and scope of their democratic practices, the circumstances in which
individuals are able to exercise non-predetermined choices can lead to variation in
the perceptions of free will and the expression of commitment to a course of action”

13

Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science (2024) 58:884–893

889

(Rousseau, 2016, p. 213). This aspect is not discussed in the thematic issue, but it can
be a subject for further consideration.

“I’m a Fool of My Brain”: “Mindless Neuroscience” as a Direction in
Neuroscience
Interestingly, some biologists think that the conflict of wishes (“I want to eat an ice
cream”, “I want not to yield to the temptation to eat an ice cream”) can be described
in neurobiological terms. In her book, Will and Self-Control. How Genes and the
Brain Prevent Us from Fighting Temptations, Irina Yakutenko writes:
But, fortunately, advanced mammals, including humans, have acquired the socalled neocortex—the ‘intellectual’ component of the great brain. Thanks to it,
we think, talk, perceive ourselves as individuals, create, analyze, count, plan
and invent. And somewhere there, in the depths of the brain, at the intersection of its new and old areas, lies our ability (with varying success) to keep
impulses in check, subordinating ancient simple desires to complex modern
goals (Yakutenko, 2018, p. 53)
Yet, placement of simple desires in some areas of a brain, and modern goals in other
areas (pair “desires—goals” is from psychology) means the introduction of a number
of internal brain homunculi with their desires and goals (cf. Dennett’s [1991] ideas
about the brain consisting of a “bundle of semi-independent agencies”). In this case,
questions about free will should concern not only us but also the homunculi (agencies), homunculi in homunculi—and so on, till consideration of the last (the first)
simplest homunculi (with their simplest desires, goals, and brains) in our brain. Gasparyan considers this aspect in her article.
Thus, on the one hand, parts of the brain have their own desires, goals, and
sub-brains.
On the other hand, the title How Genes and the Brain Prevent Us from Fighting
Temptations (and similar ones) means an opposition of the brain and us (without
brains). Who are those us who have no brains? Why do authors of these texts call
this entity us?
Based on a lot of texts with words “brains make us (do something)”, “brains prevent us”, I have introduced a slogan for this direction of neurobiological texts: “I’m
a fool of my brain”. Also I recommend reading Satel and Lilienfeld’s (2013) brilliant
book, Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience, with its section, My amygdala made me do it.
Mindless neuroscience is only a part of neuroscience. It would be stupid to accuse
all neuroscience of it. Yet, it seems that too many people can believe that “brains
make us” do everything we do, after reading the appropriate popular texts. It should
be discussed. In this context, among the most recent publications, an important one
seems to be Maoz’s (2024) review titled, Freedom from free will, of Sapolsky’s
(2023) book, Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will.
Sinha (2024) writes:

Tapping into the philosophy of neuroscience, different generations of neuroscientist struggled with the ascription of psychological properties either to mind or
the brain. Bennett and Hacker (2003) showed how attribution of psychological
attributes solely to the brain results in a conceptual confusion or Mereological
fallacy. According to Harre (2016), ‘The general form of a mereological fallacy
is a sense-destroying attribution of certain properties of parts to the wholes of
which they are components, and of certain properties of wholes to their constituent parts’ (p. 633)
As a possible solution, Sinha considers Harre’s Hybrid Psychology (Harre, 2016)
which integrates neuroscience and discursive psychology. “…the brain as a tool
(studied by neuroscience) mediates what persons say and do (studied by discursive
psychology)” (Brinkmann, 2011, p. 3; cited by Sinha, 2024).
Hejlesen (2024, abstract) refers to Harre too and distinguishes
…between two fundamentally different approaches to the understanding of our
actions that relate to the concept of agency [and free will—A.P.]: On the one
hand, is the agentic view that focuses on reasons and asserts that our agency is
the basis of our actions. On the other hand, is the non-agentic view that focuses
on causes and asserts that our actions are causally determined
He shows that the approaches are complementary to one another and both necessary to understand a human being. Based on The catalyzing mind: Beyond models of
causality, by Cabell and Valsiner (2013), Hejlesen develops a notion of catalysis in
open systems as opposed to simple causality (simple determinism) in closed systems.

Conclusion
The thematic issue points some possibilities of free will in different physical, social,
and technological worlds, and discussions of the possibilities.
What are the possibilities and limitations of free will in various other worlds differing from our world?
What are the possibilities and limitations of free will in different species, both in
our world and in other hypothetical worlds, including future species, naturally evolving, and artificially modified?
What are the possibilities and limitations of free will related to the development
of AI?
How can the diversity of free will levels in an agent be related to possible levels
(depth) of its self-knowledge? What can agents differing in levels of self-knowledge
know and think about the issue of free will?
How do different societies (social worlds) support and inhibit different manifestations of free will in different areas?
What is the role of hard neurodeterminism and “mindless neuroscience” in general
neuroscience?

ORIGINAL PAPER

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument
against Retributive Criminal Punishment
Gregg D. Caruso

Received: 3 January 2018 / Accepted: 7 March 2018 / Published online: 15 March 2018
# Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018

Abstract Within the United States, the most prominent
justification for criminal punishment is retributivism.
This retributivist justification for punishment maintains
that punishment of a wrongdoer is justified for the
reason that she deserves something bad to happen to
her just because she has knowingly done wrong—this
could include pain, deprivation, or death. For the
retributivist, it is the basic desert attached to the criminal’s immoral action alone that provides the justification
for punishment. This means that the retributivist position
is not reducible to consequentialist considerations nor in
justifying punishment does it appeal to wider goods such
as the safety of society or the moral improvement of
those being punished. A number of sentencing guidelines in the U.S. have adopted desert as their distributive
principle, and it is increasingly given deference in the
Bpurposes^ section of state criminal codes, where it can
be the guiding principle in the interpretation and application of the code’s provisions. Indeed, the American
Law Institute recently revised the Model Penal Code so
as to set desert as the official dominate principle for
sentencing. And courts have identified desert as the
guiding principle in a variety of contexts, as with the
Supreme Court’s enthroning retributivism as the
Bprimary justification for the death penalty.^ While
retributivism provides one of the main sources of justification for punishment within the criminal justice

system, there are good philosophical and practical reasons for rejecting it. One such reason is that it is unclear
that agents truly deserve to suffer for the wrongs they
have done in the sense required by retributivism.
In the first section, I explore the retributivist justification of punishment and explain why it is

Within the United States, one of the most prominent
justifications for legal punishment is retributivism. This
retributivist justification for punishment maintains that
punishment of a wrongdoer is justified for the reason
that she deserves something bad to happen to her just
because she has knowingly done wrong—this could
include pain, deprivation, or death. For the retributivist,
it is the basic desert attached to the criminal’s immoral
action alone that provides the justification for punishment. This means that the retributivist position is not
reducible to consequentialist considerations nor in justifying punishment does it appeal to wider goods such as
the safety of society or the moral improvement of those
being punished. A number of sentencing guidelines in
the U.S. have adopted desert as their distributive principle [1, 2], and it is increasingly given deference in the
Bpurposes^ section of state criminal codes [3], where it
can be the guiding principle in the interpretation and
application of the code’s provisions [4]. Indeed, the
American Law Institute recently revised the Model Penal Code so as to set desert as the official dominate
principle for sentencing [5, 6]. And courts have identified desert as the guiding principle in a variety of contexts [7–9], as with the Supreme Court’s enthroning
retributivism as the Bprimary justification for the death
penalty^ [10].1
While retributivism provides one of the main sources
of justification for punishment within the criminal justice system, there are good philosophical and practical
reasons for rejecting it. One such reason is that it is
unclear that agents truly deserve to suffer for the wrongs
they have done in the sense required by retributivism. In
first section, I explore the retributivist justification of
punishment and explain why it is inconsistent with free
will skepticism. In second section, I then argue that even
if one is not convinced by the arguments for free will
skepticism, there remains a strong epistemic argument
against causing harm on retributivist grounds that undermines both libertarian and compatibilist attempts to
justify it. I maintain that this argument provides sufficient reason for rejecting the retributive justification of
legal punishment. I conclude in third section by briefly
sketching my public health-quarantine model, a nonretributive alternative for addressing criminal behavior
that draws on the public health framework and prioritizes prevention and social justice [12–15]. I argue that
the model is not only consistent with free will

skepticism and the epistemic argument against
retributivism, it also provides the most justified, humane, and effective way of dealing with criminal
behavior.

Retributivism and Free Will
To begin, it is important to note that retributive punishment is grounded in the notion of desert—the idea that
punishing people for certain offenses is morally permissible because such people deserve to be punished. As
retributivist Mitchell Berman puts it: BA person who
unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or risks harm to
others or to significant social interests deserves to suffer
for that choice, and he deserves to suffer in proportion to
the extent to which his regard or concern for others falls
short of what is properly demanded of him^ [16: 269].
Michael S. Moore, another leading retributivist, echoes
these sentiments and further highlights the purely
backward-looking nature of desert:
[R]etributivism is the view that we ought to punish
offenders because, and only because, they deserve
to be punished. Punishment is justified, for a
retributivist, solely by the fact that those receiving
it deserve it. Punishment may deter future crime,
incapacitate dangerous persons, educate citizens
in the behaviour required for a civilized society,
reinforce social cohesion, prevent vigilante behaviour, make victims of crime feel better, or satisfy
the vengeful desires of citizens who are not themselves crime victims. Yet for a retributivist these
are a happy surplus that punishment produces and
form no part of what makes punishment just:
for a retributivist, deserving offenders should
be punished even if the punishment produces
none of these other, surplus good effect. [17: 153;
see also 18, 19]
Similar accounts of retributivism can be found in Immanuel Kant [20], Stephen Kershnar [21, 22], and
Douglas Husak [23]. It’s important to note that the
concept of desert being invoked by retributivists is basic
in the sense that it is not reducible to consequentialist
considerations for punishment or to forward-looking
goods such as the safety of society or the moral improvement of the criminal. For the retributivist, since
human beings are (sometimes) morally responsible in

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

the basic desert sense [see 24–26], we are justified in
giving them their just deserts in the form of punishment
for moral and legal offenses.
Depending on how retributivists view the relationship between desert and punishment, we can identify
three different varieties of the view—weak, moderate,
and strong [7–10, 27]. Weak retributivism maintains that
negative desert (which is what the criminal law is concerned with) is merely necessary but not sufficient for
punishment. Moderate retributivism maintains that negative desert is necessary and sufficient for punishment
but that desert does not mandate punishment—i.e., there
may be other goods that outweigh punishing the deserving or giving them their just deserts [28]. Strong
retributivism, on the other hand, maintains that desert
is necessary and sufficient for punishment and mandates
punishment.2
In what follows, I will limit my discussion to
moderate and strong varieties of retributivism and
leave weak retributivism aside. I will do so because, first, most leading retributivists defend one
of these stronger forms of retributivism—e.g., Kant
[20], Moore [17–19], Kershnar [21, 22], Husak
[23], Berman [16], etc.—and it’s my desire to address
the dominant view, not a subordinate view held by few.
Second, weak retributivism is considered by many
retributivists to be Btoo weak to guide the criminal law^
and as amounting to nothing more than Bdesert-free
consequentialism side constrained by negative desert^
[27: 7]—in fact, some theorists simply define
retributivism in a way that excludes weak retributivism
from consideration altogether.3 Lastly, the weight the
2
Immanuel Kant, for example, famous maintained that the death
penalty was not only deserved but also obligatory in cases of murder:
B[W]hoever has committed murder, must die. There is, in this case, no
juridical substitute or surrogate, that can be given or take for the
satisfaction of justice. There is no Likeness or proportion between Life,
however painful, and Death; and therefore there is no Equality between
the crime of Murder and the retaliation of it but what is judicially
accomplished by the execution of the Criminal. Even if a civil society
resolved to dissolve itself with the consent of all its members—as
might be supposed in the case of a people inhabiting an island resolving
to separate and scatter themselves throughout the whole world—the
last murderer lying in prison ought to be executed before the resolution
was carried out. This ought to be done in order that every one may
realize the desert of his deeds, and that blood-guiltiness may not remain
upon the people; for otherwise they might all be regarded as participators in the murder as a public violation of justice^ [20: Part II: 6].
3
David Boonin, for example, defines retributivism as follows: BIt
claims that committing an offense in the past is sufficient to justify
punishment now, whether or not this will produce any beneficial
consequences in the future^ [29: 85 (emphasis added)].

15

criminal law gives desert and the way retributivism is
practically implemented in the law (especially in the
U.S.) indicates that the desert of offenders is typically
seen as sufficient for punishment. For these reasons, I
will take as my target the claim that the desert of offenders provides sufficient grounds for punishment and
that we are therefore justified in sometimes punishing an
offender for no purpose other than to see the guilty get
what they deserve.4
I will also be limiting my investigation to the question of legal punishment. Punishment is the intentional
imposition of an unpleasant penalty or deprivation for
wrongdoing upon a group or individual, typically meted
out by an authority. In the case of legal punishment, this
authority is the state. More precisely, we can say that
legal punishment consists in one person’s deliberately
harming another on behalf of the state in a way that is
intended to constitute a fitting response to some offense
and to give expression to the state’s disapproval of that
offense [29]. Legal punishment is distinct from interpersonal punishment or punishment carried out by an angry
mob since it is guided by a system of criminal laws
concerned with punishment of individuals who have
committed crimes. The question under discussion in this
paper, then, is whether retributive legal punishment is
ever justified?
One reason to think that agents do not deserve to
suffer for the wrongs they have done in the purely
backward-looking sense required for retributivism is
that they are not free and morally responsible in the
sense required. Hard determinists, for example, have
long argued that determinism is true and incompatible
with free will and basic desert moral responsibility—
either because it precludes the ability to do otherwise
(leeway incompatibilism) or because it is inconsistent
with one’s being the Bultimate source^ of action (source
incompatibilism). More recently, a number of contemporary philosophers have presented additional arguments against basic desert moral responsibility that are
agnostic about determinism—see, e.g., Derk Pereboom
[24, 25], Galen Strawson [30, 31], Saul Smilansky [32],
Neil Levy [33], Bruce Waller [34, 35], and myself [36].
4
I will also henceforth drop the distinction between moderate and
strong retributivism. Strong retributivists defend two distinct claims:
that we are justified in punishing offenders and that we have a duty to
do so. Moderate retributivists seek only to defend the first claim. Since
I am simply concerned with the question, BDoes the desert of offenders
sometimes provide sufficient grounds for punishment?^ we can set this
distinction aside here.

Most argue that while determinism is incompatible with
free will and basic desert moral responsibility, so too is
indeterminism, especially the variety posited by quantum mechanics [e.g., 24, 25, 36]. Others argue that
regardless of the causal structure of the universe, we
lack free will and moral responsibility because free will
is incompatible with the pervasiveness of luck [33].
Others (still) argue that free will and ultimate moral
responsibility are incoherent concepts, since to be free
in the sense required for ultimate moral responsibility
we would have to be causa sui (or Bcause of oneself)
and this is impossible [30, 31].
What all these arguments have in common, and what
they share with classical hard determinism, is the thesis
that what we do and the way we are is ultimately the
result of factors beyond our control and because of this
we are never morally responsible for our actions in the
basic desert sense—the sense required for retributive
punishment. This is not to say, of course, that other
conceptions of responsibility cannot be reconciled with
determinism, chance, or luck [25, 37, 38]. Nor is it to
deny that there may be good pragmatic reasons to maintain certain systems of punishment and reward. Rather,
it is to insist that to hold people truly or ultimately
morally responsible for their actions—i.e., to hold them
responsible in a non-consequentialist desert-based
sense—would be to hold them responsible for the results
of the morally arbitrary, for what is ultimately beyond
their control, which is fundamentally unfair and unjust.
Hence, free will skepticism presents a challenge to
retributivism since it does away with the idea of basic
desert. If agents do not deserve blame just because they
have knowingly done wrong, neither do they deserve
punishment just because they have knowingly done
wrong [25: 157].
While I have elsewhere argued that our best philosophical and scientific accounts of the world support
free will skepticism [15, 36, 39], the epistemic argument
I develop below remains independent of this claim. The
argument maintains that even if one is not convinced by
the arguments for free will skepticism it remains unclear
whether retributive punishment is justified. This is because the burden of proof lies on those who want to
inflict harm on others to provide good justification for
such harm. This means that retributivists who want to
justify legal punishment on the assumption that agents
are free and morally responsible (and hence justly deserve to suffer for the wrongs they have done) must
justify that assumption. And they must justify that

assumption in a way that meets a high epistemic standard of proof since the harms caused in the case of legal
punishment are often quite severe. It is not enough to
simply point to the mere possibility that agents possess
libertarian or compatibilist free will. Nor is it enough to
say that that the skeptical arguments against free will
and basic desert moral responsibility fail to be conclusive. Rather, a positive and convincing case must be
made that agents are in fact morally responsible in the
basic desert sense, since it is the backward-looking
desert of agents that retributivists take to justify the harm
caused by legal punishment.

Epistemic Argument
I will now argue that the retributive justification of legal
punishment fails to meet the burden of proof required to
justify the harms caused. My argument for this conclusion runs as follows:
(1) Legal punishment inflicts harms on individuals
and the justification for such harms must meet a
high epistemic standard. If it is significantly probable that one’s justification for harming another is
unsound, then, prima facie, that behavior is seriously wrong [40].
(2) The retributive justification for legal punishment
assumes that agents are morally responsible in the
basic desert sense and hence justly deserve to
suffer for the wrongs they have done in a backward-looking, non-consequentialist sense (appropriately qualified and under the constraint of
proportionality).
(3) If the justification for the assumption that agents
are morally responsible in the basic desert sense
and hence justly deserve to suffer for the wrongs
they have done does not meet the high epistemic
standard specified in (1), then retributive legal
punishment is prima facie seriously wrong.
(4) The justification for the claim that agents are morally responsible in the basic desert sense provided
by both libertarians and compatibilists face powerful and unresolved objections and as a result fall far
short of the high epistemic bar needed to justify
such harms.
(5) Hence, retributive legal punishment is unjustified and the harms it causes are prima facie
seriously wrong.

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

This argument builds on previous work done by
Double [41], Vilhauer [42], Corrado [43], and
Pereboom [24, 25, 40], and it maintains that no extant
account of basic desert moral responsibility has the
evidentiary support needed to justify retributive legal
punishment.5
Premise (1) places the burden of proof on those who
want to justify legal punishment, since the harms caused
in this case are often quite severe—including the loss of
liberty, deprivation, and in some cases even death. It
maintains that if it significantly probable that one’s
justification for harming another is unsound, then, prima
facia, that behavior is seriously wrong. Support for this
premise can be found both in the law and everyday
practice. As Michael Corrado writes:
The notion of a burden of proof comes to us from
the adversarial courtroom, where it guides the
presentation of evidence. In both criminal and
civil cases the defendant is presumed not guilty
or not liable, and it is up to the accuser to persuade
the finder of fact. The only difference between the
two cases lies in the measure of the burden that
must be carried, which depends upon the seriousness of the outcome. When all that is at issue is the
allocation of a loss that can be measured in financial terms, the accuser needs only to prove the
defendant’s fault by a preponderance of the evidence, but where the defendant’s very life or freedom is at stake the burden is considerably higher:
the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt. [43: 1]
Our ordinary everyday practices also place the burden of
proof on those who knowingly and intentionally cause
harm to others. In fact, even in cases where harm is
foreseeable but not intended, we often demand a high
level of justification. Lets say a newspaper receives a tip
on a story that will likely cause great harm to a public
figure, potentially sinking their career. In such circumstances, good journalistic standards demand that the
5
I should note that Double limits his argument to libertarianism (see
below) and Vilhaeur stops short of extending his concerns to legal
punishment. While Corrado’s argument is similar to the one I develop
here, we both arrived at our arguments independently. I first sketched
the basic structure of the epistemic argument back in 2015 when
working on my book manuscript Unjust Deserts: Free Will, Moral
Responsibility, and Legal Punishment (still unpublished) and briefly
referenced it in Caruso [44]. Pereboom [24, 25, 40] also runs a similar
argument but does not develop it in detail.

17

story be independently verified and properly vetted
before it is run. If the newspaper were to run the story
without properly vetting it, and later discover that the tip
came from an organization who seeks to undermine the
public’s trust in the media, we would rightly condemn
the newspaper for not applying a higher epistemic standard. Things are even clearer when the harm caused in
intentional, like when a police officer decides to use
deadly force. The use of deadly force, we demand,
may be justified only under conditions of extreme necessity, when all lesser means have failed or cannot
reasonably be employed. And while we may acknowledge that the level of justification required may vary
depending on the severity of harm involved, we typically demand that one must have good justification for
intentionally harming another.
In the case of legal punishment where the severity of
harm is beyond question, I maintain that we should
place the highest burden possible upon the state. If the
state is going to punish someone for first-degree murder,
say, then the epistemic bar that needs to be reached is
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But does this burden of
proof carry over to theoretical debates—for example,
the debate over free will and moral responsibility? Here
I follow Pigliucci and Maarten [45] as well as Corrado
[43: 3] in distinguishing between evidential burden of
proof, which comes into play only when there is no
costs associated with a wrong answer, and prudential
burden of proof, which comes into play precisely when
there are significant costs associated with a wrong answer. As Corrado applies the distinction to theoretical
matters:
…in a purely philosophical contest where nothing
of a practical nature hangs on the outcome it is the
evidential burden of proof that is required, and the
standard of proof must be Bby a preponderance of
the evidence^: whoever simply has the better evidence must win. On the other hand, if something
practical does depend on the outcome of the philosophical debate, then what would matter is the
prudential burden. The costs on either side would
determine the allocation of the burden and the
standard by which satisfaction of the burden is to
be measured. [43: 3]
I contend that given the practical important of moral
responsibility to legal punishment, and given the gravity
of harm caused by legal punishment (to the individuals

G. D. Caruso

18

punished as well as those family and friends who depend upon the imprisoned for income, love, support,
and/or parenting), the proper epistemic standard to adopt
is the prudential burden of proof.
When premise (1) is combined with (2), which is
simply a statement of the retributivist justification for
legal punishment as summarized in the previous section,
we get the requirement that retributivists must justify
their core assumption—i.e., that agents are morally responsible in the basic desert sense and hence justly
deserve to suffer for the wrongs they have done. While
this demand for justification is reasonable given the
strength of (1), many retributivists simply deny or ignore it. For instance, Larry Alexander, Kimberly Kessler
Ferzan, and Stephen Morse—in their book Crime and
Culpability: A Theory of Criminal Law—maintain that
B[w]e need take no stand on the freewill-determinism
issue^ [27: 15].6 They go on to explain:
Two of is—Ferzan and Morse—are persuaded by
the arguments for compatibilism. One of
us—Alexander—is not. His view is that
compatibilism provides only a hollow form of
moral responsibility, not the full-blooded form
that our reactive attitudes assume. In particular, it
seems unresponsive to the worry that what appears to an actor to be a reason, or a reason with
a particular positive or negative weight, seems to
be beyond the actor’s proximate control. One the
other hand, he also believes that libertarianism
cannot deliver a form of moral responsibility
worth wanting because, just like determinism, its
foil, libertarianism takes control out of the agent’s
hands and relinquishes it to chance—or else just
makes it utterly mysterious. [27: 15]
How, then, does Alexander justify doing harm on retributive grounds when Bneither determinism nor indeterminism can provide a satisfactory account of moral
responsibility, and together they appear to exhaust the
6
In the book, Alexander, Ferzan, and Morse set out to explain what the
criminal law would look like if structured by moderate retributivism:
BWhat we intend to do in this book is to explore what the doctrines of
the criminal law would look like if they were structured (primarily) by
the concern that criminal defendants receive the punishment they
deserve, and particularly that they receive no more punishment than
they deserve…In our view, it is the defendant’s decision to violate
society’s norms regarding the proper concern due to the interests of
others than establishes the negative desert that in turn can both justify
and limit the imposition of punishment^ [27: 6–7].

possibilities^ [27: 15]? We are provided with the following, rather unsatisfying, answer:
Alexander believes, as a metaphilosophical position, that the freewill-determinism puzzle is one of
those antinomies of thought that we are incapable
of resolving, along with the mind-body and
infinity puzzles. For him, the freewilldeterminism puzzle will always dog practices
of holding people morally responsible, practices that we nevertheless cannot dispensing
with. Because we cannot dispense with such practices, a retributivist regarding criminal punishment need not resolve or even take sides on the
freewill issue. [27: 15 (italics added)]
Alexander’s position seems to be that while we will
never be able to comprehend the bases of moral responsibility [see 27: 15n22], we should nevertheless continue causing harm on retributivist grounds since Bwe
cannot dispense with such practices.^
There are, however, at least two major problems with
this reply. First, why think that we can never dispense
with our retributive practices when it comes to the
criminal law? If Alexander were limiting his comments
to our interpersonal reactive attitudes, arguing (à la
Strawson [46]) that they were indispensible or centrally
important, that would be one thing. But in the comment
above and the book from which it is drawn, Alexander is
discussing legal punishment. I see no reason to think
that retributivism is indispensible to the criminal law.
The fact that several countries have moved away from
retributive models of legal punishment (to greater or
lesser extent) is evidence enough that this is false. It is
also important to distinguish between narrow-profile
and wide-profile reactive attitudes [25, 47]. Narrowprofile attitudes are local or immediate emotional reactions to situations, whereas wide-profile responses are
not immediate and involve rational reflection. While we
may be unable to appreciably reduce narrow-profile
retributive reactions in some cases, it is open for us to
diminish or even eliminate retributive reactions in wideprofile cases. If I am hurt in an intimate personal relationship, for example, it may be beyond my ability to
resist feeling resentment or anger. But when it comes to
the law, which involves wide-profile rational reflection,
we can indeed disavow retributivism in the sense of
rejecting any force it may be assumed to have in justifying a harmful response to wrongdoing.

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

Second, to continue doing harm on retributivist
grounds even though one acknowledges that the philosophical foundations of the view can never be
comprehended or justified, violates the basic precept,
both widespread and intuitive, that one should restrain
from doing harm unless otherwise justified. Note that
Alexander is not saying that despite our inability to
justify, in some foundational way, basic desert moral
responsibility, we should consider libertarianism or
compatibilism as providing justification enough. Instead, he explicitly states, Bcompatibilism provides only
a hollow form of moral responsibility^ and
Blibertarianism cannot deliver a form of moral responsibility worth wanting.^ Since this is a conclusion
shared by many free will skeptics, it’s unclear why he
thinks we should continue holding agents morally responsible in the basic desert sense, let alone subject
them to severe and often painful forms of legal punishment. It in no way helps to claim that the problem of free
will is an antinomy. One does not get off the justificatory
hook with regard to legal punishment by simply throwing their hands up in the air and saying, Bsince there is
no satisfying solution to the problem of free will we
should continue assuming agents are morally responsible and hence justly deserve to suffer for the wrongs
they have done.^ Rather, one needs to provide a positive
and compelling reason for believing that agents are free
and morally responsible in the sense required.
Morse and Ferzan at least claim they are Bpersuaded
by the arguments for compatibilism.^ But how persuaded? In answering this, I will focus on Morse’s take on
compatibilism since he spells it out at great length
elsewhere [48–51]. He begins by noting that:
The criminal law is a thoroughly folkpsychological enterprise. Doctrine and practice
implicitly assume that human beings are agents,
creatures who act intentionally for reasons, who
can be guided by reasons, and who in adulthood
are capable of sufficient rationality to ground full
responsibility unless an excusing condition obtains. We all take this Bstandard picture^ for
granted because it is the foundation not just of
law but of interpersonal relations generally, including how we explain ourselves to others and
to ourselves. [49: 40]
He goes on to argue that the standard picture is thoroughly compatibilist in nature. He acknowledges that

19

Bmetaphysical assumptions matter^ [49: 44], especially
when it comes to the criteria for moral responsibility, but
adds: BThe question is whether one must resolve or even
defend one’s metaphysical and other philosophical
foundations in these fraught areas. I think not^ [49:
44]. According to Morse, Bwhen philosophy is foundational and practically important, one’s position must be
acknowledged but need not be defended or, a fortiori,
resolved^ [49: 45].
When it comes to the free will debate, Morse maintains that B[t]here will always be good arguments for and
against the various positions^ [49: 45]. With no ability
to declare a winner, he asks himself: BWhat is a poor,
country lawyer-scholar to do in such circumstances
when trying to make normative arguments about doctrine, practice, and policy?^ [49: 45]. His answer is to:
…start with a normative position that is attractive
at the non-metaphysical level of applied ethical,
moral, political, and legal theory. If this position is
consistent with a reasonable metaphysics that does
not conflict with relatively uncontroversial, or at
least plausible, empirical accounts about the world
and with other reasonable philosophical theories,
then one can proceed without defending the metaphysics, the empirics, and other philosophical
positions. [49: 46]
According to Morse, compatibilism provides just such a
reasonable metaphysics. And while incompatibilists
are likely to point to all the arguments against
compatibilism that suggest that the normative position
adopted is unjustified, Morse maintains that Ba sophisticated metaphysician who adheres to the chosen metaphysics would have answers, and there would be no
decisive arguments to refute the sophisticate^ [49: 46].
It is this lack of decisiveness that Morse points to as key.
He also maintains that any position that wants to deny
the Bstandard picture^ should carry the burden of proof,
since B[a]ny position that violates common sense should
meet the most demanding burden of persuasion^ [49:
46]. For these reasons, he concludes: BI am
compatibilist, a perfectly plausible metaphysics, and
will continue to believe that robust responsibility is
possible until an incontrovertible argument that all
would accept requires me to jettison this view^ [49: 49].
While Morse’s reasoning is quite sophisticated I contend that it gets things exactly backwards. First, free will
skepticism also offers a reasonable metaphysics, one

20

that is consistent with our best philosophical and scientific accounts of the world. While Morse might find it is
unattractive at the level of applied moral, political, and
legal theory [51], Pereboom, Waller, and I have elsewhere argued that adopting the skeptical perspective
actually has distinct advantages in these areas [12, 13,
15, 37, 39, 52; see also 24, 25, 34, 35]. Second, I
disagree with Morse on who carries the burden of proof.
He claims the burden falls on those who want to reject
basic desert moral responsibility (what he calls Brobust
responsibility). I, on the other hand, maintain that if one
is going to cause harm on the assumption that
compatibilism is true and agents are morally responsible
in the sense required for retributive justice, then the
burden is on them to establish beyond a reasonable
doubt that this is the case. While Morse is correct that
in certain circumstances the burden falls on those who
advance philosophical views contrary to common sense,
things change dramatically when significant harm is
involved. Perhaps it’s acceptable to adopt a reasonable
metaphysics with regard to, say, realism about the external world, but this is significantly different than
adopting compatibilism about moral responsibility since
it is not used to justify retributive harm.
My proposal is that we adopt a precautionary principle when it comes to unresolved metaphysical/
philosophical positions that are likely to cause severe
harm. The principle would be analogous to the ones
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, various legally binding international treaties (e.g., the Montreal Protocol, Rio Declaration, and Kyoto Protocol),
and the law of the European Union. The precautionary
principle has been used by policy makers to justify
discretionary decisions in situations where there is the
possibility of harm from a decision, course of action, or
policy, and extensive scientific knowledge on the matter
is lacking. The principle implies that there is a social
responsibility to protect the public from exposure to
harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk.7 The principle has been adopted in numerous
contexts, including in response to climate change skeptics who argue that we should do nothing to cap Co2 and
other greenhouse gas emissions in the face of (what they
consider to be) scientific uncertainty about man-made
climate change. The 1992 United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, for instance, states:
7

G. D. Caruso

BWhen an activity raises threats of harm to human health
or the environment, precautionary measures should be
taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not
fully established scientifically.^
In the current context, I propose that we employ a
precautionary principle that constrains which
Breasonable metaphysics^ one adopts in the face of
philosophical uncertainty—or, at least, constrains the
practical implementation of that metaphysics in the arena of criminal law. If, as Morse thinks, the free will
debate is currently unresolvable (something I disagree
with but will not take issue with here), then on precautionary grounds we should prohibit causing retributive
harm in the case of legal punishment until and unless the
high epistemic standard of proof outlined earlier is met.
Just like tobacco executives who challenged the link
between smoking and cancer by appealing to scientific
uncertainty, desertists who justify retributive harm on
the grounds that no Bincontrovertible argument that all
would accept^ has yet been presented against the notions of desert and moral responsibility are violating a
pretty reasonable precautionary principle. The principle
demands that in the context of uncertainty, precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals from
unjustified harm.
But what about those philosophers who are more
confident about the existence of free will and basic
desert moral responsibility? Both Morse and Alexander
appear willing to accept premise (4) of the epistemic
argument, which states that the philosophical arguments
for libertarianism and compatibilism are subject to powerful and unresolved objections. They instead reject the
demand for a high level of justification for the claim that
agents are morally responsible and hence justly deserve
to suffer for the wrongs they have done. Yet philosophers who defend libertarian and compatibilist accounts
of free will are more likely to challenge premise (4). In
defending premise (4) against these accounts, I will take
as my starting point Bruce Waller’s powerful insight—
spelled out and defended at great length in his recent
book The Stubborn System of Moral Responsibility
[35]—that belief in basic desert moral responsibility is
stronger than the philosophical arguments presented in
their favor. More specifically, I will argue that the philosophical arguments presented in favor of basic desert
moral responsibility, which are needed to justify retributive harm, are either scientifically implausible (as in the
case of agent causation), empirically unwarranted (as in
the case of event causal libertarianism), beg the question

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

(as in the case of Strawson and other forms of
compatibilism), or end up Bchanging the subjection^
(as in the case of Dennett and others).
Let me being with a rather obvious case of a philosopher who believes more strongly in moral responsibility than the philosophical arguments he presents in its
favor, that of Peter van Inwagen. After championed the
consequence argument in favor of incompatibilism,8
van Inwagen proceeds to argue that we must reject
determinism even though it means free will Bremains a
mystery^ [53, 54]. He acknowledges that libertarian free
will is difficult to make sense of, yet he also claims that
to Bdeny the free-will thesis is to deny the existence of
moral responsibility, which would be absurd^ [53: 223].
According to van Inwagen, Bfree will undeniably exists
and there is a strong and unanswered prima facie case
for its impossibility^ [54: 1–2]. It is the absurdity of
denying moral responsibility that leads van Inwagen to
favor libertarianism (and embrace a mystery) over its
incompatibilist alternative of free will skepticism. But
he doesn’t stop there. He continues on to say that, if
science were one day able to present us with compelling
reasons for believing in determinism, B[t]hen, and only
then, I think, should we become compatibilists^ [53:
223]. Essentially, after several decades of heroically
defending the consequence argument, van Inwagen
would be willing to chuck it out the window (if need
be) to preserve moral responsibility. Such a defense of
moral responsibility (if one can call it that) is a far cry
from the level of justification needed to license the kind
of harm caused by retributive legal punishment—which
is all I am concerned with here.
Additional evidence of the kind of stubbornness
Waller has in mind can be found among agent-causal
libertarians—such as C. A. Campbell [55], Richard
Taylor [56], and Roderick Chisholm [57]—who are
willing to embrace mysterious and Bgod-like^ powers
and abilities to preserve moral responsibility. Chisholm,
for example, famously argued: BIf we are responsible,
and if what I have been trying to say is true, then we
have a prerogative which some would attribute only to
God: each of us, when we really act, is a prime mover
8
Although there are many different formulations of the consequence
argument, van Inwagen summarizes the basic idea as follows: BIf
determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws of
nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what went on
before we were born; and neither is it up to us what the laws of nature
are. Therefore, the consequence of these things (including our present
acts) are not up to us^ [53: 16].

21

unmoved^ [57: 32]. While Chisholm appears to gleefully embrace such miraculous powers, Taylor is at least
more willing to acknowledge the embarrassment of such
a move. He says, for instance, of his own theory:
One could hardly affirm such a theory of agency
with complete comfort, however, and not wholly
without embarrassment, for the conception of
agents and their powers which is involved in it is
strand indeed, if not positively mysterious. In fact,
one can hardly be blamed here for simply denying
our data outright, rather than embrace this theory
to which they do most certainly point. [56: 53]
This is far cry form the epistemic standard needed to
justify punishing someone on the grounds that they
posses libertarian free will and therefore deserve it.
And as Waller so eloquently points out: BWhen contemporary philosophers are willing to posit miracles in order
to save moral responsibility, the philosophical belief in
moral responsibility obviously runs deep and strong^
[35: 3].
Naturalistically minded event-causal libertarians
have the advantage of avoiding miraculous sui generis
kinds of causal powers, but when it comes to providing
the epistemic justification needed to ground retributive
punishment they too fall far short. Consider, for instance, the influential accounts of Robert Kane [58]
and Mark Balaguer [59]. Neither philosopher claims to
have proven libertarian free will exists or that the necessary empirical requirements posited on their respective accounts actually obtain. Rather, both settle for the
much weaker claim that their theories are consistent
with our best scientific theories and have not yet been
ruled out. The mere possibility that one of these accounts
may be true, however, is simply not enough to provide
the epistemic justification needed to ground retributive
harm. This becomes especially clear when one considers
what actually needs to be the case for, say, Kane’s
account to be true. As Manuel Vargas writes:
[N]ot only do agent mental processes have to turn
out to be indeterministic, but they must also be
indeterministic in a very particular way. If multiple
mutually exclusive aims did not cause the brain to
go into a chaotic state the theory would be
disproved. If it turned out that neurological systems weren’t sensitive to quantum indeterminacies the theory would be disproved. If it turned

G. D. Caruso

22

out that neurological systems were sensitive to
quantum indeterminacies, but not sufficiently sensitive to amplify quantum indeterminacies in a
way that affects the outcomes of choice, this too
would disprove the theory. These are not marginal
or insubstantial bets about what brain science will
reveal to us. [60, 143]
I should add, if it turned out that neurological systems
were sufficiently sensitive to amplify quantum indeterminacies in a way that affected the outcomes of choice,
but such indeterminacies did not arise at the right temporal moment required, the theory would also be
disproven. To justify retributive practices, including in
some instances excessively punitive practices, on the off
chance that all these empirical conditions will be met is
akin to moral malpractice.
The fact that libertarian accounts of free will fail to
provide the epistemic justification needed to ground
retributivism, yet continue to hold agents morally responsible in the basic desert sense, is why Richard
Double famously charges them with Bhard-heartedness^
[41]. Double’s argument can be summarized as follows.
Any thinker who holds the following three theses is
hard-hearted (i.e., morally unsympathetic, not morally
conscientious): (1) We may hold persons morally responsible only if they make libertarian choices; (2) we
should hold persons morally responsible; and (3) there is
scant epistemic justification that persons make libertarian choices. Almost all libertarians endorse (1) and (2),
and most would acknowledge (3) if pushed on it. To the
extent, then, that (3) is true (and I believe it is), it would
be hard-hearted for libertarians to hold persons morally
responsible. The reasoning here is analogical. Just as it
would be hard-hearted to punish subjects for actions if
we lacked strong evidence that those subjects did those
actions, it would likewise be hard-hearted to blame
subjects (in the backward-looking sense) for actions if
we lacked strong evidence that those subjects did those
actions from free will.
While Double restricts his charge of hard-heartedness
to libertarians, I think a similar argument can be made
against compatibilists who want to continue harming
individuals on retributivist grounds. In the case of
compatibilism, however, the lack of epistemic justification comes at a different point than that of libertarianism.
The epistemic challenge facing libertarianism is to justify the claim that we actually posses the powers and
abilities posited by such accounts. There is no

equivalent debate with regard to compatibilism. All
parties agree, including skeptics, that we have the abilities discussed by most leading compatibilist accounts—
e.g., reasons-responsiveness, voluntariness, the capacity
to act in accordance with moral reasons or one’s Deep
Self, etc. The question instead is whether such abilities
are enough to justify basic desert moral responsibility
and along with it retributive harm in the case of legal
punishment. It is here that scant epistemic justification is
generally provided.
While compatibilists reject miracles and propose accounts of moral responsibility consistent with both naturalism and determinism, they seldom provide justification for the moral responsibility system itself. In lieu of
justifying the moral responsibility system, compatibilists
typically take the system as given and instead focus on
what attitudes, judgments, and treatments are justified
from within the system. P. F. Strawson [46] is a good
example of this. His defense of the reactive attitudes
takes our normal moral responsibility practices as given
and proceeds from there to articulate special circumstances when it is acceptable not to hold someone morally responsible or to excuse them—e.g., when they are
profoundly impaired by delusion or lack any moral
capacity, either temporarily or permanently. In these
special circumstances, Strawson claims it is acceptable
to adopt the objective attitude toward them. But according to Strawson and his followers, the denial of all moral
responsibility is unacceptable, self-defeating, and/or impossible, since to permanently excuse everyone would
entail that Bnobody knows what he’s doing or that
everybody’s behavior is unintelligible in terms of conscious purposes or that everybody lives in a world of
delusion or that nobody has a moral sense…^ [46: 74].
The problem with this defense of moral responsibility, however, is that it takes for granted the very thing in
need of justification. To quote Waller once again:
[I]f we start from the assumption of the moral
responsibility system (assumptions that are so
common and deep that they are difficult to escape), then the denial of moral responsibility is
absurd and self-defeating. But the universal denial
of moral responsibility does not start from the
assumption that under normal circumstances we
are morally responsible, and it does not proceed
from that starting point to enlarge and extend the
range of excuses to cover everyone (so that everyone is profoundly flawed). That is indeed a path to

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

absurdity. Rather, those who reject moral responsibility reject the basic system which starts from
the assumption that all minimally competent persons (all who reach the plateau level) are morally
responsible. For those who deny moral responsibility, it is never fair to treat anyone as morally
responsible, no matter how reasonable, competent, self-efficacious, strong-willed, and clearsighted that person may be. [35: 103]
Since skeptics who globally challenge the moral responsibility system—e.g., Waller [34, 35], Pereboom [24,
25], Levy [33], G. Strawson [30, 31], and myself
[36]—do not accept the rules of that system, it is question begging to assume our ordinary moral responsibility practices are justified without refuting the arguments
for global skepticism.
Furthermore, even if Strawson were correct about the
necessity of holding each other responsible in our interpersonal exchanges, it’s another thing altogether to think
retributive legal punishment is justified. Perhaps one
could justify adopting an evidential burden of proof by
limiting one’s compatibilism to our interpersonal
reactive attitudes where the level of harm involved
is significantly lower than legal punishment
(though still not inconsequential). But in the case
of legal punishment, retributivists who adopt
compatibilism need to meet a higher burden of
proof. It also does not help if one decides to shift
the focus away from Strawson’s reactive attitudes
and toward an account of what those attitudes
might rightfully be reacting to—namely some capacity or feature of the agent. While contemporary
compatibilists have conceived of this capacity in a
number of different ways—including the capacity
to act in accordance with one’s Deep Self, the capacity
for rational review of actions, the capacity to act in
accordance with moral reasons, and the capacity for
reasons-responsiveness—the central question remains:
Are these capacities (alone or combined) enough to
ground basic desert moral responsibility? Given that
extant compatibilist accounts still face powerful and
unresolved objections—such as the manipulation argument [61–63], Pereboom’s four-case argument [24, 25],
van Inwagen’s consequence argument [53], Galen
Strawson’s basic argument [30, 31], Fischer’s noforking-paths argument [64], Levy’s luck pincer [33],
etc.—they fail to meet the prudential burden of proof.
For a retributivist to assume that compatibilism is true

23

and proven beyond a reasonable doubt is to beg the
question against incompatibilists and permit unjustified
harm.
While some (or most) forms of compatibilism beg the
question, others simply change the subject. Daniel
Dennett is a good example of the latter since the kind
of free will he argues for does not attempt to justify
retributivism or what I have called basic desert moral
responsibility. In a revealing exchange with Tom Clark
and Bruce Waller—on Waller’s book Against Moral
Responsibility [34]—Dennett makes this point clear.
After explaining how Waller rejects retributive punishment and basic desert moral responsibility, Dennett
writes:
[L]et me say right away that I agree with Waller’s
main conclusion in one important sense: that kind
of absolutistic moral responsibility—insisting as it
does on what I have called guilt-in-the-eyes-ofGod—is incompatible with naturalism and has got
to go. [65]
Rejecting what he considers to be an untenable
retributivist system of legal punishment and the strong
type of basic desert moral responsibility that it relies
upon, Dennett proposes Ba consequentialist defense of
just deserts^ [65] and punishment. While many
compatibilists want to secure a justification for retributive blame and punishment, Dennett does not seem to be
among them. Instead, he espouses a non-retributivist,
consequentialist concept of moral responsibility and
punishment. What is of paramount importance for
Dennett is that we find a naturalistic way to justify
punishment so as to maintain a Bsecure and civil
society^ [65]. The justification Dennett provides for
punishment, however, is decidedly different than what
many compatibilists would endorse since he acknowledges that we must abandon retributivism and basic
desert moral responsibility and replace it with an
Bultimately consequentialist^ [65] conception of punishment and reward. Given that most free will skeptics would agree, Dennett’s account fails to preserve what is of central philosophical and practical
importance—the claim that people deserve to be praised
and blamed, rewarded and punished, on strictly
retributivist and non-consequentialist grounds [see 26].
In fact, Dennett admittedly does not attempt to preserve
this sort of moral responsibility and cheerfully wishes it
Bgood riddance^ [65].

G. D. Caruso

24

One important difference, however, between
Dennett’s consequentialist justification of punishment and that of free will skeptics is that Dennett
prefers to retain the notion of just deserts. I contend that this is inconsistent with Dennett’s reformed consequentialist account of moral responsibility. As Tom Clark notes:
Whether as consequentialists we should still talk
of just deserts is debatable, given the strong deontological, retributive connotations…What you’re
advocating is the practical necessity of punishment, not its intrinsic goodness, but Bjust deserts^
strongly implies that the offender’s suffering
is intrinsically good, which you don’t think is
the case. So I think we should drop talk of
just deserts so we don’t mislead people about
what we believe are defensible justifications
for punishment. [66]
Given the canonical understanding of just deserts and
how it is used to justify various retributive attitudes,
judgments, and treatments, Dennett’s use of the term
lends itself to easy confusion and gives the mistaken
impression that he is setting out to preserve something
that he is not. Rather than defending or justifying just
deserts, Dennett ends up changing the subject. His brand
of compatibilism does not justify retributive harm—it
doesn’t even attempt to. His justification for punishment, being consequentialist in nature, is completely
consistent with the skeptic’s rejection of free will and
just deserts.
In this section I’ve argued that the burden of proof is
on the retributivist to justify legal punishment and given
the severity of harm involved the highest epistemic
standard should be adopted. Drawing from the criminal
law, I argued that the proper place to set the epistemic
bar is at the prudential standard of beyond a reasonable
doubt. I further argued that all extant accounts of
libertarianism and compatibilism fail to satisfy this
burden of proof since they are either scientifically
implausible (as in the case of agent causation),
empirically unwarranted (as in the case of event
causal libertarianism), question begging (as in the
case of Strawson and other forms of compatibilism), or
end up changing the subject (as in the case of
Dennett and others). Hence, the epistemic argument provides sufficient reason for rejecting retributive legal punishment.

The Public Health-Quarantine Model
If retributive punishment is unjustified, where does that
leave us with regard to criminal behavior? In this final
section I will suggest that the public health-quarantine
model provides an ethically defensible and practically
workable alternative to retributivism. Given the limited
space remaining, I can do no more that sketch the model.
For a fuller defense as well as replies to objections, see
Caruso [12–15] and Pereboom [24, 25, 40, 67].9
The public health-quarantine model is based on an
analogy with quarantine and draws on a comparison
between treatment of dangerous criminals and treatment
of carriers of dangerous diseases. It takes as its starting
point Derk Pereboom’s famous account [24, 25, 67]. In
its simplest form, it can be stated as follows: (1) Free
will skepticism maintains that criminals are not morally
responsible for their actions in the basic desert sense; (2)
plainly, many carriers of dangerous diseases are not
responsible in this or in any other sense for having
contracted these diseases; (3) yet, we generally agree
that it is sometimes permissible to quarantine them, and
the justification for doing so is the right to selfprotection and the prevention of harm to others; (4) for
similar reasons, even if a dangerous criminal is not
morally responsible for his crimes in the basic desert
sense (perhaps because no one is ever in this way
morally responsible) it could be as legitimate to
preventatively detain him as to quarantine the nonresponsible carrier of a serious communicable disease
[25: 156].
The first thing to note about the theory is that although one might justify quarantine (in the case of
disease) and incapacitation (in the case of dangerous
criminals) on purely utilitarian or consequentialist
grounds, both Pereboom and I want to resist this strategy
[15]. Instead, on our view incapacitation of the dangerous is justified on the ground of the right to harm in self
defense and defense of others. That we have this right
has broad appeal, much broader than utilitarianism or
consequentialism has. In addition, this makes the view
more resilient to a number of objections [15, 40].
Second, the quarantine model places several constraints on the treatment of criminals [15, 24, 25]. First,
as less dangerous diseases justify only preventative
measures less restrictive than quarantine, so less dangerous criminal tendencies justify only more moderate
9

Material in this section has been drawn from Caruso [12–15].

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

restraints [25: 156]. In fact, for certain minor crimes
perhaps only some degree of monitoring could be
defended. Secondly, the incapacitation account that results from this analogy demands a degree of concern for
the rehabilitation and well-being of the criminal that
would alter much of current practice. Just as fairness
recommends that we seek to cure the diseased we quarantine, so fairness would counsel that we attempt to
rehabilitate the criminals we detain [25: 156]. If a criminal cannot be rehabilitated, however, and our safety
requires his indefinite confinement, this account provides no justification for making his life more miserable
than would be required to guard against the danger he
poses [25: 156].
Third, this account also provides a more resilient
proposal for justifying criminal sanctions than other
non-retributive options. One advantage it has, say, over
consequentialist deterrence theories is that it has more
restrictions placed on it with regard to using people
merely as a means. For instance, as it is illegitimate to
treat carriers of a disease more harmfully than is necessary to neutralize the danger they pose, treating those
with violent criminal tendencies more harshly than is
required to protect society will be illegitimate as well. In
fact, in all our writings on the subject, Pereboom and I
have always maintained the principle of least infringement, which holds that the least restrictive measures
should be taken to protect public health and safety
[12–15]. This ensures that criminal sanctions will be
proportionate to the danger posed by an individual,
and any sanctions that exceed this upper bound will be
unjustified.
In addition to these restrictions on harsh and unnecessary treatment, the model also advocates for a broader
approach to criminal behavior that moves beyond the
narrow focus on sanctions. On the model I have developed, the quarantine analogy is placed within the
broader justificatory framework of public health ethics
[12–14]. Public health ethics not only justifies
quarantining carriers of infectious diseases on the
grounds that it is necessary to protect public health, it
also requires that we take active steps to prevent such
outbreaks from occurring in the first place. Quarantine is
only needed when the public health system fails in its
primary function. Since no system is perfect, quarantine
will likely be needed for the foreseeable future, but it
should not be the primary means of dealing with public
health. The analogous claim holds for incapacitation.
Taking a public health approach to criminal behavior

25

would allow us to justify the incapacitation of dangerous
criminals when needed, but it would also make prevention a primary function of the criminal justice system.
So instead of myopically focusing on punishment, the
public health-quarantine model shifts the focus to identifying and addressing the systemic causes of crime,
such as poverty, low social economic status, systematic
disadvantage, mental illness, homelessness, educational
inequity, abuse, and addiction [13].
In my recent Public Health and Safety: The Social
Determinants of Health and Criminal Behavior [13], I
argue that the social determinants of health (SDH) and
the social determinants of criminal behavior (SDCB) are
broadly similar, and that we should adopt a broad public
health approach for identifying and taking action on
these shared social determinants. I focus on how social
inequities and systemic injustices affect health outcomes
and criminal behavior, how poverty affects brain development, how offenders often have pre-existing medical
conditions (especially mental health issues), how homelessness and education affects health and safety outcomes, how environmental health is important to both
public health and safety, how involvement in the criminal justice system itself can lead to or worsen health and
cognitive problems, and how a public health approach
can be successfully applied within the criminal justice
system. I argue that, just as it is important to identify and
take action on the SDH if we want to improve health
outcomes, it is equally important to identify and address
the SDCB. And I conclude by offering eight broad
public policy proposals for implementing a public health
approach aimed at addressing the SDH and SDCB.
Furthermore, the public health framework I adopt
sees social justice as a foundational cornerstone to public health and safety [12–14]. In public health ethics, a
failure on the part of public health institutions to ensure
the social conditions necessary to achieve a sufficient
level of health is considered a grave injustice. An important task of public health ethics, then, is to identify
which inequalities in health are the most egregious and
thus which should be given the highest priority in public
health policy and practice. The public health approach to
criminal behavior likewise maintains that a core moral
function of the criminal justice system is to identify and
remedy social and economic inequalities responsible for
crime. Just as public health is negatively affected by
poverty, racism, and systematic inequality, so too is
public safety. This broader approach to criminal justice
therefore places issues of social justice at the forefront. It

26

sees racism, sexism, poverty, and systemic disadvantage
as serious threats to public safety and it prioritizes the
reduction of such inequalities [13].
While there are different ways of understanding social justice and different philosophical accounts of what
a theory of justice aims to achieve, I favor a capability
approach according to which the development of capabilities—what each individual is able to do or be—is
essential to human well-being [e.g., Amartya Sen and
Martha Nussbaum, see 68–71]. For capability theorists,
human well-being is the proper end of a theory of
justice. And on the particular capability approach I
favor, social justice is grounded in six key features of
human well-being: health, reasoning, self-determination, attachment, personal security, and respect [13,
71]. Following Powers and Faden [71], I maintain that
each of these six dimensions is an essential feature of
well-being such that Ba life substantially lacking in any
one is a life seriously deficient in what it is reasonable
for anyone to want, whatever else they want^ [71: 8].
The job of justice is therefore to achieve a sufficiency of
these six essential dimensions of human well-being,
since each is a separate indicator of a decent life.
The key idea of capability approaches is that social
arrangements should aim to expand people’s capabilities—their freedom to promote or achieve functionings
that are important to them. Functionings are defined as
the valuable activities and states that make up human
well-being, such as having a healthy body, being safe, or
having a job. While they are related to goods and income, they are instead described in terms of what a
person is able to do or be as a result. For example, when
a person’s need for food (a commodity) is met, they
enjoy the functioning of being well-nourished. Examples of functionings include being mobile, being
healthy, being adequately nourished, and being educated. The genuine opportunity to achieve a particular
functioning is called a capability. Capabilities are the
real opportunity to promote or achieve functionings and
Bto lead the kind of life he or she has reason to value^
[69: 87].
Bringing everything together, my public healthquarantine model characterizes the moral foundation of
public health as social justice, not just the advancement
of good health outcomes. That is, while promoting social
goods (like health) is one area of concern, public health
ethics as I conceive it is embedded within a broader
commitment to secure a sufficient level of health and
safety for all and to narrow unjust inequalities [71]. More

G. D. Caruso

specifically, I see the capability approach to social justice
as the proper moral foundation of public health ethics.
This means that the broader commitment of public health
should be the achievement of those capabilities needed to
secure a sufficient level of human well-being—including, but not limited to, health, reasoning, self-determination, attachment, personal security, and respect. By placing social justice at the foundation of the public health
approach, the realms of criminal justice and social justice
are brought closer together. I see this as a virtue of the
theory since it is hard to see how we can adequately deal
with criminal justice without simultaneously addressing
issues of social justice. Retributivists tend to disagree
since they approach criminal justice as an issue of individual responsibility and desert, not as an issue of prevention and public safety. I believe it is a mistake to hold
that the criteria of individual accountability can be settled
apart from considerations of social justice and the social
determinants of criminal behavior. Making social justice
foundational, as my public health-quarantine model
does, places on us a collective responsibility—which is
forward-looking and perfectly consistent with free will
skepticism—to redress unjust inequalities and to advance
collective aims and priorities such as public health and
safety. The capability approach and the public health
approach therefore fit nicely together. Both maintain that
poor health and safety are often the byproducts of social
inequities, and both attempt to identify and address these
social inequities in order to achieve a sufficient level of
health and safety.
Summarizing the public health-quarantine model,
then, the core idea is that the right to harm in selfdefense and defense of others justifies incapacitating the
criminally dangerous with the minimum harm required
for adequate protection. The resulting account would not
justify the sort of legal punishment whose legitimacy is
most dubious, such as death or confinement in the most
common kinds of prisons in our society. The model also
specifies attention to the well-being of criminals, which
would change much of current policy. Furthermore, the
public health component of the theory prioritizes prevention and social justice and aims at identifying and taking
action on the social determinants of health and criminal
behavior. This combined approach to dealing with criminal behavior, I maintain, is sufficient for dealing with
dangerous criminals, leads to a more humane and effective social policy, and is actually preferable to the harsh
and often excessive forms of punishment that typically
come with retributivism.

Justice without Retribution: An Epistemic Argument against Retributive Criminal Punishment

Conclusion
In this paper I have argued that one of the most prominent justifications for legal punishment, retributivism,
fails to justify the harms it causes and is therefore
seriously wrong. After exploring the retributive justification of legal punishment and explaining why it is
inconsistent with free will skepticism (in first section),
I argued that even if one is not convinced by the
arguments for free will skepticism there remains a
strong epistemic argument against causing harm on
retributivist grounds that undermines both libertarian
and compatibilist attempts to justify it (in second section). I argued that this argument provides sufficient
reason for rejecting retributive legal punishment. I then
concluded (in third section) by briefly sketching my
public health-quarantine model, a non-retributive alternative for addressing criminal behavior that draws on
the public health framework and prioritizes prevention
and social justice. The public health-quarantine model, I
contend, offers a non-retributive way forward and a
suitable conception of justice without retribution. The
burden of proof is on the retributivist to explain why this
alternative is unacceptable and, more importantly, how
they overcome the epistemic argument given that reasonable doubt still remains concerning the existence of
free will and basic desert moral responsibility.

Abstract In this article, we will identify two issues that
deserve greater attention from those researching lay people’s attitudes to moral responsibility and determinism.
The first issue concerns whether people interpret the term
Bmoral responsibility^ in a retributive way and whether
they are motivated to hold offenders responsible for predetermined behaviour by considerations other than
retributivism, e.g. the desires to condemn the action (as
opposed to the actor) and to protect society. The second
issue concerns whether explicitly rejecting moral responsibility and retributivism, after reading about determinism,
would have any impact on Bimplicit^ retributivism when
recommending a sentence for a hypothetical offender. We
will report the results of an exploratory study that investigated these questions. Our preliminary findings raise the
possibility that a significant proportion of participants
either i) may not interpret Bmoral responsibility^ in the
basic, retributive sense of the term, which is at issue in the
determinism debate, or ii) may be unconsciously motivated by non-retributive considerations to judge that the
offender is morally responsible, in the basic, retributive
sense. If this is confirmed by future research, a wider
implication would be that theorists’ arguments against

retributivism are more likely to affect public attitudes to
punishment when non-retributive ways of achieving important punishment goals are emphasised. Our preliminary findings also suggested that explicit retributivism did
not correlate with implicit retributivism (although it seems
that the explicit rejection of retributivism did correlate
with more lenient sentencing). If this is confirmed in
future research, it would imply that free will theorists
who wish to affect public attitudes toward punishment
should, when communicating their research to the public,
give detailed consideration to the implications for
sentencing.

Part I: Introduction
It is widely accepted that Bthe criminal law generally
assumes the existence of free will^ and assumes that those
who freely choose to commit crimes are morally responsible for their actions [1]. The concepts of Bfree will^ and
Bmoral responsibility^ are pre-requisites for retributive
punishment, and judges often refer to the offender’s moral
responsibility when sentencing e.g. [2–4]. A rich philosophical literature exists on the meaning of these concepts
– Bnearly every major figure in the history of philosophy
has had something …to say about free will^ [5:5]. Recently, a growing number of theorists working on free will
and moral responsibility have begun to focus on the
practical implications of their views for the punishment

100

of offenders e.g. [6–10]. However, much more work
needs to be done to enable this literature to have an impact
on the criminal justice system [11].1 Experimental philosophy has the potential to help bridge the gap between
philosophical debate and penal policy. This relatively new
approach seeks to investigate empirically how lay people
actually use terms that have long interested philosophers.
In particular, many of these studies have investigated
whether lay people consider free will and moral responsibility to be compatible or incompatible with determinism. Theorists would be in a better position to communicate arguments for penal reform if they had a better
understanding of how lay people – upon whose support
the criminal justice system depends – currently interpret
terms like Bmoral responsibility^ and Bfree will^, which
figure prominently in reformers’ arguments. Studies on
Bmotivated reasoning^ suggest that lay people’s use of
such terms is driven by social motives, such as punitive
desires, so that they use these terms differently in different
situations, depending on the goal they are seeking to
achieve in that situation [12]. Using the same term in
different ways gives rise to the risk of arguing at crosspurposes. A better understanding of the concerns that
drive lay people’s use of the terms Bfree will^ and Bmoral
responsibility^, could help to avoid confusion and enable
theorists to focus on addressing those concerns directly.
This article has three aims. Firstly, it aims to identify
certain questions that have not been sufficiently explored in previous studies on the compatibility of moral
responsibility and determinism. These underexplored
questions will first be briefly summarised in this introductory section and then will be explained in more detail
in Parts II-V, which will define the key terms involved
and will discuss the relevant background literature, and
Part VI, which will outline the aims and hypotheses of
an exploratory study (involving 602 participants) designed to investigate these questions. Secondly, this
article will discuss the methodology and preliminary
findings of our exploratory study (Parts VII- IX). Thirdly, in Part X we will map out some directions for future
research that would examine alternative explanations for
our preliminary findings and would shed more light on
the questions we investigated.

E. Shaw, R. Blakey

The first underexplored issue that we identified concerns whether lay people interpret the term Bmoral
responsibility^ in a retributive way and whether they
are motivated to hold offenders responsible for predetermined behaviour by considerations other than
retributivism, e.g. the desires to condemn the action
(as opposed to the actor) and to protect society. Specifically, we maintain that the following question deserves
greater attention: are participants less likely to apply the
term Bmorally responsible^ to an offender whose conduct was predetermined if participants are given the
(non-retributive) options of denying that the offender
is morally responsible while simultaneously a)
condemning the action (as opposed to the actor) and/or
b) supporting measures to protect society? One novel
contribution of our exploratory study was the way in
which we aimed to shed light on the above-mentioned
question concerning lay people’s use of the term Bmoral
responsibility^. Our preliminary findings were that the
majority of participants gave incompatibilist responses
about moral responsibility and determinism (even when
the non-retributive options were not mentioned) and that
incompatibilist responses increased when the nonretributive options were explicitly mentioned. This
raises the possibility that a significant proportion of
participants either i) may not interpret Bmoral
responsibility^ in the basic, retributive sense of the term,
which is at issue in the determinism debate, or ii) may be
unconsciously motivated by non-retributive considerations to judge that the offender is morally responsible,
in the basic, retributive sense. Failure to distinguish
between different senses of moral responsibility and to
consider non-retributive motives for holding offenders
responsible might have led certain previous researchers
to overestimate the number of folk compatibilists. If our
preliminary findings are confirmed by future research, a
wider implication would be that theorists’ arguments
against retributivism are more likely to affect public
attitudes to punishment when non-retributive ways of
achieving important punishment goals are emphasised.
The second underexplored issue that we identified
concerns whether explicitly rejecting moral responsibility and retributivism, after reading about determinism,
would have any impact on Bimplicit^ retributivism
when recommending a sentence for a hypothetical offender. Certain types of aggravating/mitigating factors
seem more relevant to the offenders’ future dangerousness (a non-retributive consideration), while other types
of aggravating/mitigating factor seem more relevant to

Determinism, Moral Responsibility and Retribution

the offender’s blameworthiness for the crime he has
committed (a retributive consideration). Participants
who place greater weight on factors relevant to blameworthiness are more Bimplicitly retributive^ than those
who place greater weight on the offender’s dangerousness. Our preliminary findings could be interpreted as
suggesting that explicit retributivism did not correlate
with implicit retributivism, in this sense, (although it
seems that the explicit rejection of retributivism did
correlate with more lenient sentencing).2 If this interpretation is confirmed in future research, this would imply
that free will theorists who wish to affect public attitudes
toward punishment should, when communicating their
research to the public, give detailed consideration to the
implications for sentencing.

Part II: Retributivism and the Challenge
of Determinism
Among penal theorists, Ba broadly retributive theory of
punishment…remains in the ascendency in the AngloAmerican world^ [13:145]. The majority of legal systems
contain retributive elements and there is a growing body of
empirical evidence that most lay people have strong and
persistent retributive attitudes [14]. At the heart of
retributivism is the following claim: if an individual, acting
freely, commits a serious wrong, then the offender deserves to be punished because of the blameworthy nature
of this free action, whether or not punishment promotes
further beneficial consequences for society [15, 16].
However, for millennia it has been debated whether
humans possess the kind of free will required for retributive
punishment to be fair [17]. One traditional challenge to the
idea that humans possess the relevant kind of free will
arises from determinism - which implies that all our decisions and actions are determined by factors beyond our
control, such as our biological constitution and environment. If determinism is true, then these factors determine
how our characters develop and which reasons we see fit to
act upon. Given the presence of these factors, all of our
decisions had to occur exactly as they did. This challenge
to retributivism has received new impetus from neuroscience see e.g., [18: 8–9, 19: 22–36, 20]. Neuroscientists
2
This is in line with previous research on BPart V: Explicit versus
implicit retributivism^ [36]. However, this previous research had not
examined the effect of reading about determinism on explicit and
implicit retributivism.

currently adopt the philosophical assumption that Ball behaviour is caused by our brains^ [21:161]. If everyone’s
motivations, personality and deliberations are entirely determined by their brains’ development (and the way the
brain responds to their situation), which in turn was caused
to develop in that exact way by genetic and environmental
factors beyond their control, the question arises whether it
could be fair to inflict retributive punishment on anyone.3
There are two ways of attempting to defend
retributivism from this kind of challenge – compatibilism
and libertarianism. Compatibilism is the idea that moral
responsibility and determinism are compatible. (For overviews of different varieties of compatibilism see [22, 23].)
According to an influential version of compatibilist
retributivism, all that is required for free will and retribution, are capacities, such as the ability to respond to
reasons. If a person is rational, understands the reasons
against breaking the law and does not care enough about
those reasons to refrain from offending, then she is a
suitable candidate for retributive punishment: it is irrelevant that her genes and environment made it inevitable
that she would develop into the kind of person who would
not care enough about the reasons for obeying the law,
see, e.g. [24, 25], drawing on the account of reasonsresponsiveness developed in [26]. 4,5 Libertarian
incompatibilists maintain that determinism and free will
3
The study reported in this article investigated whether lay people
considered moral responsibility to be incompatible with
Bbiopsychosocial determinism^. This idea implies that every decision
a person makes is the result of a set of biological, psychological and
social factors that were sufficient to guarantee that the person would
make exactly that decision. When describing biological factors, our
study explicitly mentioned the brain’s role in decision-making, because
in recent years, evidence from brain science has been among the main
reasons that theorists have cited for taking determinism seriously and
for questioning our current practices of holding offenders responsible
and subjecting them to retributive punishment.
4
However, in those rare cases where someone cannot care at all about
the reasons against committing serious crimes, like murder, some
compatibilists argue that this suggests she does not fully understand
those reasons and might relieve her from responsibility on that basis,
see, e.g. [25].
5
Some compatibilists, have defended Bhistorical^ pre-conditions for
moral responsibility, which require that the agential characteristics in
virtue of which a person is responsible (e.g. one’s rational capacities
and values) must not have the Bwrong type^ of causal history. For
example, Haji’s account would rule out a history that involves extreme
manipulation by others, such as indoctrination or interference by a
malevolent neuroscientist: Haji, I., 1998. Moral appraisability: Puzzles,
proposals, and perplexities. Oxford: Oxford University Press. However, causation by Bnormal^ factors, not involving manipulation (e.g.
genetic factors), would not undermine responsibility on this account,
even if these factors make it inevitable that one will develop into the
kind of person who behaves immorally.

102

are incompatible. Furthermore, although libertarians accept that factors beyond our control may influence us, they
deny that our decisions and actions are completely determined. According to libertarians, it is still possible, up to
the moment of choosing, for a free agent to decide differently. (For an overview of libertarian theories see [27]; for
an account which links this conception of free will to
retributive punishment see, e.g., [28].)
Our criminal justice system seems to presuppose that
offenders have Bfree will^ in some sense of the word.
However, it is disputed whether current legal doctrines
are more consistent with a compatibilist or a libertarian
conception of free will [29]. As brain science breathes
new life into the free will debate, theorists have increasingly speculated about whether growing acceptance of
determinism is capable of Bradically transforming the
criminal justice system^ [20:1784]. In an influential
article [20], Green and Cohen predict that this transformation will come about through a shift in public attitudes, rather than through legal arguments. They claim
that most lay people intuitively believe that retributive
punishment is only fair if offenders have libertarian free
will. They predict that greater public understanding of
neuroscience will undermine belief in libertarian free
will and that, as a result, retributive sentencing will lose
public support and we will have to seek alternative, nonretributive responses to criminal behaviour.
Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate lay people’s intuitions about free will and determinism e.g. [30, 31]. These studies have yielded important
insights into the factors that can affect lay peoples’ intuitions about this topic - for a discussion of the value of this
research see [32]. However, studies in this area should pay
more attention to clarifying certain key terms, such as
Bmoral responsibility^. Participants are typically presented
with a scenario involving someone in a deterministic
universe performing an immoral action. Participants are
then asked whether the wrongdoer is morally responsible.
Unfortunately, it is unclear how participants interpret the
term Bmoral responsibility^, and, specifically, whether
they understand it in the sense that is relevant to retributive
punishment. To be morally responsible in the retributive
sense is to be deserving of punishment in virtue of the
blameworthy nature of the action, rather than to promote
further beneficial consequences for society. Retributive
responsibility involves Bbasic^ desert, in that one deserves
blame/punishment just because Bone has performed the
[morally wrongful] action, given sensitivity to its moral
status, and not by virtue of consequentialist or

E. Shaw, R. Blakey

contractualist considerations^ [32:122]. This particular
type of responsibility is not only of utmost significance
to the institution of punishment [13, 14], but is actually the
sense of responsibility that is really at issue in the debate
about free will and determinism [32:123]. There are other
senses of responsibility, which are much more easily reconciled with determinism. For instance, individuals might
be regarded as responsible in a forward-looking, consequentialist, sense, if blaming/punishing them is likely to
bring about the good consequence of weakening their
disposition to commit wrongful acts in the future [33].

Part III: Motivated Reasoning about Responsibility
In studies that did not distinguish responsibility in the
retributive sense from forward-looking considerations
like social protection e.g. [30] participants’ responsibility judgements might have been motivated (consciously
or unconsciously) by the desire to punish the offender to
stop such crimes happening in future. In other words,
participants may have judged offenders Bresponsible^,
in order to justify punishing offenders to protect society.
If so, it would be unwarranted to draw the conclusion
from such studies that lay people are Bcompatibilists^ or
Bincompatibilists^, because (a proportion of) participants would not have interpreted responsibility in the
retributive sense - the sense that is at issue in the debate
between compatibilists and incompatibilists. There are
good reasons for suspecting that judgments about moral
responsibility may be influenced by the desire to punish,6 since existing research on motivated reasoning
strongly suggests that the use of responsibility-related
concepts such as Bfree will^ [12] and Bintention^ [34,
35] are driven by this desire.7 For example, in one study,
two groups of participants were presented with one of
two scenarios – a man performing a morally neutral
6
This article uses the phrase Bdesire to punish^ in a broad sense that is
intended to be neutral on the issues such as whether a) participants were
motivated by the thought that the offender ought to be punished and by
the perception that holding him responsible was a necessary step before
that could happen or b) whether participants’ desire to punish was more
like an affective Bgut reaction^ that motivated their use of
responsibility-related terms without any process of conscious reasoning. For a discussion of the different possibilities see [35].
7
Research by Joshua Knobe [34] in particular has been very widely
discussed and has proved highly replicable: Cova, F. et al. 2018.
Estimating the reproducibility of experimental philosophy. Review of
Philosophy and Psychology. Although there have been various explanations of Knobe’s findings, explanations in terms of motivation by the
desire to punish or blame have been especially influential.

Determinism, Moral Responsibility and Retribution

action (foraging for discarded aluminum cans and selling them to a recycling company) or a man performing a
wrongful action (burglary) [12]. Participants were then
asked to what extent they believed the man exercised
free will. In both scenarios the man was described as
being subject to exactly the same economic pressures –
he was unemployed and had two children to support.
Yet participants attributed significantly more free will to
the robber than to the forager.8 A persuasive explanation
for this result is that people desire to blame and punish
the robber (but not the forager), and so they are motivated to attribute free will only to the robber in order to
justify these desires.
So far, studies on motivated reasoning have focused
on the effect of the general desire to punish on lay
people’s use of responsibility-related concepts. These
studies have not investigated the effect of the specific
purposes of punishment (e.g. retribution, or consequentialist goals such as protecting society from crime). The
study reported here begins to explore this question by
investigating the extent to which consequentialist (as
opposed to retributive), motives affected lay people’s
use of the term Bmoral responsibility^.

Part IV: Punishment and Communication
Apart from social protection, another possible nonretributive motive for holding an offender responsible
is the desire to condemn his wrongful action (as opposed
to condemning the actor). Previous empirical research
has attempted to determine the strength of people’s
desire to communicate disapproval of wrongful actions
through (informal) punishment. One study revealed that
people still desire to punish wrongdoers even if the
wrongdoer is not aware he is being punished [14]. The
researchers interpreted this as casting doubt on the idea
that the desire to communicate censure is a major motivation behind lay people’s decisions about punishment.
However, this study did not rule out the possibility that
the desire to condemn the offender’s action had some
motivational force. The researchers seemed to assume
that the point of communicating condemnation is to
express censure to the offender. Although this is
8

Interestingly, members of the group who read about the robber were,
after reading this scenario, also significantly more likely to report belief
that free will exists in general, compared to members of the group who
read about the forager, suggesting that the desire to punish also promotes belief in free will in general.

103

typically one of the main purposes of condemnation,
participants might have been motivated to punish the
offender by the desire to express condemnation to relieve their own feelings, or to let the researcher know
that the participants condemned the wrongdoing, even
when they could not communicate condemnation to the
offender. Likewise, in previous studies on whether lay
people consider determinism and moral responsibility to
be compatible, participants may have been motivated to
hold the offender morally responsible in order to condemn the offender’s action (as opposed to the actor) –
either to relieve their own feelings, or to let the researcher know that they disapproved of the crime. The exploratory study reported in this article aimed to shed some
light on whether lay people’s judgements about responsibility for pre-determined offending are influenced by
the desire to condemn the crime.

Part V: Explicit Versus Implicit Retributivism
Greene and Cohen predict that public awareness of neuroscience will transform the criminal justice system by
leading to the rejection of retribution (a prediction that
researchers have begun to investigate empirically, e.g.
[40]). For this transformation to take place, it would not
be enough for the public to have theoretical doubts about
whether offenders are truly responsible for their actions.
These doubts must be translated into political support, in
practice, for non-retributive sentencing. In other words,
Bexplicit^ non-retributivism (i.e. saying that one rejects
retributivism, when asked about which general principles
should inform sentencing) needs to translate into
Bimplicit^ non-retributivism (i.e. only giving weight to
non-retributive considerations, when deciding which
sentences are appropriate in particular cases). For example, if someone explicitly claims to believe that the goal of
sentencing should be preventing recidivism, rather than
retribution, this seems to imply that they will give more
weight to factors such as the offender’s likelihood of
reoffending than to considerations which would matter
more to retributivists, such as whether the offender’s
reasons for committing the original offence indicated a
blameworthy state of mind. However, in reality, there
seems to be a discrepancy between what people say about
the goals of sentencing and how they actually behave
when faced with specific sentencing decisions. In fact,
some studies suggest that the majority of explicit nonretributivists are actually implicitly retributive [36].

E. Shaw, R. Blakey

104

Therefore, in addition to asking whether the offender was
responsible, we also asked some questions about what
sentence would be appropriate and about the relevance of
the offender’s blameworthiness versus his dangerousness
to the sentencing decision.

Part VI: Aims and Hypotheses
The research discussed above gives rise to the following
questions and hypotheses, which we investigated in this
study:
1 Will Participants Be less Motivated to Judge that an
Offender Is Responsible for Pre-Determined Behaviour when Participants Realize that they Can
Achieve Non-retributive Goals (E.G. Social Protection or Condemning Wrongful Actions) without
Holding the Offender Responsible?
We suspected that in previous studies that left the
term Bmoral responsibility^ undefined a proportion of
the participants who appeared to give compatibilist responses were not interpreting the term Bmoral
responsibility^ in the sense that is relevant to retributive
punishment. It seems plausible that when confronted
with a description of serious wrongdoing, participants’
responses are affected by a) the desire to condemn the
wrongful action (as distinct from condemning the
wrongdoer) and b) the desire that something should be
done to prevent such wrongdoing happening in future.
These two considerations are separate from the question
of whether the wrongdoer deserves retributive punishment. When participants are simply presented with two
stark alternatives – to state that the offender either is or is
not morally responsible – a proportion of participants
may have feared that denying that the offender is morally responsible might suggest that the participants condone the action and are not concerned about preventing
such actions in future. If we are correct, then a proportion of participants in previous studies who appeared to
consider moral responsibility to be compatible with
determinism, were in fact motivated by non-retributive
considerations. The following hypotheses were proposed: H1 When participants are invited to either a)
hold the offender morally responsible or b) to deny that
he is morally responsible while simultaneously
condemning the wrongful action, more participants will
be willing to deny that the offender is morally

responsible than when they are simply asked about the
offender’s responsibility status without being given the
opportunity to condemn the action. H2 When participants are invited to either a) hold the offender morally
responsible or b) to deny that he is morally responsible
while simultaneously proposing that measures are taken
to prevent such behaviour in future, more participants
will be willing to deny that the offender is morally
responsible than when they are simply asked about the
offender’s responsibility status without being given the
opportunity to propose preventive measures.
2 Do Participants Who Explicitly State that Responsibility and Retribution Are Incompatible with
Retributivism Also Implicitly Reject Retributive
Considerations when Recommending an Appropriate Sentence for a Hypothetical Offender whose
Behaviour Was Predetermined?
In view of the evidence on explicit versus implicit
retributivism discussed above, we formulated a further
hypothesis, H3: a significant proportion of participants
who deny that the offender is morally responsible will
nevertheless be influenced by retributive considerations
when recommending an appropriate sentence.

Part VII: Methodology
929 participants were recruited via Prolific Academic (a
crowdsourcing platform supported by Oxford University Innovation). The study was conducted online using
Qualtrics research software. The data was analysed
using SPSS statistical software.
The Scenario
The study began with the statement below:
BThe following scenario takes place in 2080. The
scenario involves scientific evidence being presented in a criminal court. Please imagine that
science in 2080 has advanced far beyond science
today and that scientists know far more about how
we make conscious decisions.^
We included this statement in order to make it easier for
participants to accept our stipulation that, for the purposes of the experiment, they should assume that human

Determinism, Moral Responsibility and Retribution

decision-making was subject to determinism. We feared
that participants would be more reluctant to accept this
stipulation if the scenario were set in the present, given
that there is still much that scientists do not know about
the human brain. To prevent the scenario from seeming
too remote from the real world, it was not set in the very
distant future. Earlier studies have been criticised for
involving unrealistic, science fiction scenarios, e.g.
events taking place on another planet. There is a risk
that people’s reactions to such scenarios might not correspond to the intuitions that they would have about the
real world [37]. The present study aimed to reduce this
risk, by setting the scenario in the relatively familiar
environment of a courtroom.
Next, participants read the following statement about
an offender’s wrongful action (burglary):
BMr Williams has been found guilty of breaking
into the house of his neighbour, Mr Samuels, and
stealing some money from inside the house.^
It was important, given the aims of the study, to describe
the scenario in terms of a named offender, a named
victim and a specific offence. The study aimed to examine the effect of the participants’ desire to punish the
offender on the participants’ judgments about responsibility. Earlier research suggests that this desire to punish
is more salient when the participants are asked to consider a concrete case of wrongdoing, rather than only
being asked about the responsibility-status of predetermined human beings in the abstract [38].
Participants then read the testimony of an expert
witness – a neuroscientist giving evidence at Mr.
Williams’s trial - who argued that Mr. Williams’s actions
were the result of neurobiological determinism. The
participants were asked, when answering the subsequent
questions, to assume that everything the expert said
accurately represented how human decision-making
worked. Here is the expert’s description of determinism:
BWhen we make a conscious choice to act in a
particular way, we make this particular choice (rather than any other choice) because of the way our
character has developed and because of the reasons
that we are motivated to act upon. There is strong
agreement within the scientific community that
brain processes determine the way our character
develops and determine which reasons we are motivated to act upon in a particular moment.

105

Every unconscious and conscious thought (including all the thoughts that make up our character
and our reasons for acting) is linked to particular
brain processes, so that every time a specific
brain-process occurs, the corresponding thoughtprocess must also occur.
There is also agreement in the scientific community that our genes and our environment determine
the way our brain, our character and our thought
processes develop. By 'environment', we mean all
of our life experiences and the circumstances of
our current situation.
It is also agreed that our environment and our genes
are completely caused by earlier events that eventually go back to events that occurred before we
were born. Therefore, factors beyond our control our genes and events that occurred in the distant
past - are the ultimate cause of every decision we
make in life. Given the presence of these factors, all
of our choices had to happen exactly as they did.^
This initial description of determinism made reference to
brain processes (rather than, for example, describing determinism in purely psychological terms, or simply in
terms of causation by Bprior events^). The role of the brain
was emphasized, because the study aimed to shed light on
whether Greene and Cohen were right to think that public
acceptance of determinism and rejection of retribution
would come about as a result of increased public awareness of brain science. However, placing emphasis on the
brain when describing determinism gives rise to the risk
that participants will assume that the brain brings about
behaviour in a way that is unresponsive to what is going
on in the person’s environment. There is also the risk that
participants will make the Bby-passing error^ and incorrectly assume that the brain influences our actions in a way
that necessarily bypasses conscious reasoning [31]. In
order to reduce such risks, we explicitly stated that brainprocesses were, in turn, affected by environmental (as well
as genetic) factors and stated that decision-making involves Bconscious choice[s]^ and Bthought-process[es]^.
In addition, in keeping with the courtroom scenario, we
described a lawyer cross-examining the expert witness in
order to seek clarification on matters that could potentially
confuse a layperson. Here is an example:
BLawyer: If Mr Williams’s genes and environment
caused his decisions, does that mean reasons
played no role in his decision-making?

Group 3 responsible versus
non-responsible + protect society

Group 4 responsible versus
non-responsible + protect society
and condemn action

Expert: Mr Williams was influenced by reasons.
Your ‘environment’ includes the reasons that you
come across for behaving one way rather than
another. For example, a parent or teacher might sit
down and explain to a child why it is important to
obey the law. That explanation is part of the child’s
environment. When the child grows up he might
read a newspaper article about the impact of crime
on its victims. That article is also part of his environment and will provide a reason to obey the law.
Lawyer: Did Mr Williams understand the reasons
why burgling his neighbour’s house was wrong?
For example, did Mr Williams understand that the
burglary would distress his neighbour?
Expert: Yes he did. But his genes and environment
guaranteed that, on the night of the crime, Mr
Williams would not be sufficiently motivated by
that reason against burgling his neighbour's house
(the distress it would cause his neighbour). Given
his genes and environment, it was impossible for
Mr Williams to be motivated by that reason on this
occasion. ^
We included a number of comprehension checks in the
study to check that participants had read and understood
the descriptions of the hypothetical crime and of determinism, e.g. BSo, according to the expert, is every
thought process linked to a brain process?^

After asking the questions about whether a hypothetical
offender was responsible for pre-determined behaviour,
we asked the participants about their level of agreement
(ranging from 1 = Bstrongly disagree^ to 6 Bstrongly
agree^) with a number of statements about the justification
for imposing coercive measures on the hypothetical offender. One of these statements contained the following

non-responsible + condemn action

After reading the scenario, participants were divided into
four groups. Members of all groups were presented with
two statements and asked which statement best reflected
their own opinion of Mr. Williams (on the assumption that
the expert witness’s evidence is accurate). The options
presented to each group are shown in Table 1:

retributive justification: the offender Bdeserves to be
punished because he made a free choice and is
blameworthy^. The other justifications referred to the
following non-retributive considerations: rehabilitation,
compensation, incapacitation, specific deterrence and general deterrence.
Implicit Retributivism
Next, participants were given two additional pieces of
information about the offender: information about whether his motive for offending was good or bad (reflecting
retributive concerns) and whether his risk of reoffending
was low or high (reflecting consequentialist concerns).
Participants were shown one of the following 4 combinations: i) good motive + high risk, ii) good motive + low
risk, iii)bad motive + high risk, iv) bad motive + low risk.
The Bgood motive^ was described in the following terms:
BMr Williams wanted the money from the burglary in
order to protect his son from a drug dealer. The drug
dealer was threatening to harm his son if he did not pay
the money^. The Bbad motive^ was described as: BMr
Williams wanted the money from the burglary in order to
pay a drug dealer^. The Bhigh risk^ scenario was described as follows: BA reliable and expert psychologist
conducts a rigorous assessment of the social, psychological and biological factors affecting Mr Williams. The
psychologist concludes that Mr Williams has a very high
(87%) likelihood of committing further crimes^. In the
Blow risk^ scenario, it was stated that B...The psychologist
concludes that Mr Williams has a very low (3%) likelihood of committing further crimes^. Participants were
then asked to recommend a prison sentence for the hypothetical offender between 0 and 24 months. Finally, participants were asked to rate how much the offender’s
motive and likelihood of reoffending had influenced their
sentencing decision using the following scale: 1 = very
unimportant, 2 = unimportant, 3 = slightly unimportant,
4 = slightly important, 5 = important, 6 = very important.

Part VIII: Results

107

common with experiments concerning free will. For example, Nahmias et al. (2007) excluded 22% of their
sample for failing comprehension checks. Sommers
(2010) notes that people routinely exclude 10–30% of
participants in these types of studies. However, in many
studies, there were no appreciable differences between
those who failed the comprehension checks and those
who passed.^ [39] Furthermore, the relatively high number of comprehension checks in the present study probably led to a larger proportion of participants being excluded from the sample than would otherwise be the case. The
comprehension checks were introduced in order to reduce
the risk that participants would be influenced by various
misconceptions that have been identified in the existing
literature, e.g. the assumption that determinism bypasses
conscious deliberation [45] and to reduce the risk that
those participants who may have an intuitive commitment
to indeterminism would (despite our instructions to the
contrary) revert to their default assumption that people
(including the hypothetical offender in the scenario) possess indeterministic free will [46].
Of the 602 remaining participants, the following proportions of the sample had or were studying the following
subjects at university: 5.81% law, 14.85% psychology,
3.12% neuroscience, 12.06% biology, 18.84% any other
science, 9.58% sociology, 4.09% criminology, 10.33%
any other social science, 9.26% philosophy, and 19.38%
any other of the arts or humanities. In respect to gender,
49.41% percent of the sample identified as female,
49.30% identified as male and .97% identified as other.
The following proportions of the sample had completed
the following highest levels of education: 1.08% less than
secondary/senior/high school, 20.02% secondary/senior/
high school, 26.70% education obtained between school
and university, 38.32% bachelor’s degree, 11.30%
master’s degree and 2.15% doctorate degree. While 49
nationalities were represented in the sample, by far the
most common nationalities were American (36.06%) and
British (35.41%). The mean age of the participants was
32.26 (SD = 11.00). The present study was larger than
many previous studies and the age-range of participants
was wider than many previous studies, in which participants were typically undergraduates.

When participants are given the option of achieving
the (non-retributive) goals of social protection and
condemning the action (as opposed to the actor) without
holding the offender responsible, the proportion of
compatibilist responsibility judgments decreases. Specifically, a significantly smaller proportion of participants held the offender responsible when given the
independent opportunity to condemn the offending behaviour (χ2 (1, N = 464) = 4.03, p = .045), protect society from further offending (χ2 (1, N = 464) = 5.76,
p = .016) or both (χ2 (1, N = 465) = 8.59, p = .003).
These results appear to confirm our first two hypotheses.
Public Support for Incompatibilism?
In addition to showing that the question wording affected responsibility judgements, it Table 1 suggests that the
majority of participants were Bincompatibilists^ about
responsibility and determinism, i.e. they did not consider responsibility to be compatible with determinism.
This was found across all 4 variations of the question
wording – even the first variation, which involved a
simple choice between responsibility and non-responsibility. Previous studies that presented participants with
this simple choice yielded conflicting results about public support for compatibilism versus incompatibilism
e.g. [30, 31]. We had not made a prediction about
whether the majority of participants would be
compatibilists or incompatibilists. We had only hypothesized that our alterations to the question wording would
affect these results.
The BFragility^ of Incompatibilist Responses
The question about whether retributive considerations
(which cited the offender’s Bfree choice^ and
Bblameworthiness^) provided good reasons for imposing coercive measures on the pre-determined offender
gave rise to the following interesting finding: A significant proportion (43.7%) of participants who had given

26.75

23.65

incompatibilist responses when asked about responsibility (i.e. judged that the offender was Bnot
responsible^ for neurobiologically determined behaviour), nevertheless, later in the survey, expressed some
level of agreement with the retributive idea that the same
offender Bdeserved to be punished because he had made
a free choice and was blameworthy^. Participants were
asked to rate their level of agreement with this statement
about deserved punishment on the following scale: 1 =
strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = slightly disagree,
4 = slightly agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree. Of those
participants who had denied that the offender was morally responsible, but who also expressed some agreement with the statement about deserved punishment, the
mean level of agreement was 4.53 (SD 0.66).
Explicit Versus Implicit Retributivism
Explicit judgments about responsibility had no significant effect on the extent to which participants were
implicitly influenced by the retributive consideration
(motive) as opposed to the consequentialist consideration (risk of reoffending). We had merely hypothesised
(H3) that there would be some disparity between explicit responsibility judgments and implicit retributivism
and so the finding of no significant relationship went
beyond what we had hypothesised.
Sentencing and the Correlation between Compatibilist
Retributivism and Sentence Severity
Participants who endorsed the idea that the offender was
responsible and deserved retributive punishment for
determined behaviour recommended a slightly longer
prison sentence than participants who considered the
offender non-responsible and who endorsed only nonretributive justifications for the sentence. Attitude Towards Retributivism had a significant (p = .048) effect,
with retributivists recommending a mean sentence of

Determinism, Moral Responsibility and Retribution

12.39 months and non-retributivists recommending a
mean sentence of 10.17 months.

Part IX: Discussion
This section will compare the aims and preliminary
findings of our exploratory study with some earlier
studies in this area and will discuss the ways in which
the questions we have begun to investigate advance
beyond the existing research. We will also consider
some of the limitations of our study and alternative
explanations for our findings, which raise possible directions for future research (discussed further in the next
section).
The Responsibility Question
Previous studies investigated lay people’s intuitions
about the compatibility of determinism and responsibility. In this article we have discussed the importance of
clarifying different senses of the term Bmoral
responsibility^ and of investigating lay people’s motives
for holding offenders morally responsible. Our preliminary findings raise the possibility that that a significant
proportion of participants either 1) may not interpret
Bmoral responsibility^ in the basic, retributive sense of
the term, which is at issue in the determinism debate, or
2) may be unconsciously motivated by non-retributive
considerations to judge that the offender is morally
responsible, in the basic, retributive sense. Failure to
distinguish between different senses of moral responsibility and to consider non-retributive motives for holding offenders responsible might have led certain previous researchers e.g. [30] to overestimate the number of
folk compatibilists. If our findings are confirmed by
future research, a wider implication would be that theorists’ arguments against retributivism are more likely to
affect public attitudes to punishment when nonretributive ways of achieving important punishment
goals are emphasised. One limitation of our exploratory
study was that, when asking the responsibility question,
the word length was not identical for each option. If
participants preferred the options that were described
using more words, this might partly explain our findings. Future follow-up studies could be designed to
address this issue.
Previous studies e.g. [40, 41] have drawn a distinction between retributive and certain non-retributive

109

reasons for punishment, but they did not distinguish
retribution from condemning a criminal action (as opposed to the actor) as we did in the present exploratory
study. Furthermore, these earlier studies focused on
retributive versus non-retributive punishment, but did
not investigate the specific questions raised in this article
concerning the use of the term Bmoral responsibility^.
One novel contribution of our study was the approach it
took to investigating the use of this particular term. The
specific question we investigated was: would participants be less likely to apply the term Bmorally
responsible^ to an offender whose conduct was
predetermined if participants were given the (nonretributive) options of denying that the offender is morally responsible while simultaneously a) condemning the
action (as opposed to the actor) and/or b) supporting
measures to protect society? Shariff et al. conducted a
series of ingenious studies that appear to suggest that
reading Bmechanistic^ explanations of human behaviour
reduces belief in free will and responsibility and thereby
reduces support for retributive punishment - which is a
very significant finding. However, they did not aim to
examine the question investigated in the present study
concerning whether participants’ use of the term Bmoral
responsibility^, in the context of a deterministic scenario,
would be affected by reading that it was possible to
achieve non-retributive goals without holding the offender responsible. Furthermore, the conception of
Bmechanism^ used by Shariff et al. (while worth investigating) was very different from the concept of determinism employed in the present study. For example,
consider the following extracts from their study [42]:
BThree assumptions can be made about free will.
The first assumption is that part of one’s brain is
concerned with making plans for future actions…
The second assumption is that one is not conscious of the Bcomputations^ done by this part of
the brain but only of the Bdecisions^ it makes…
The third assumption is that the decision to act on
one’s plan…is also subject to the same limitations
in that one has immediate recall of what is decided, but not of the computations that went into the
decision…One’s self can attempt to explain why it
made a certain choice. Sometimes we may reach
the correct conclusion. At other times, we will
either not know or, more likely, will confabulate,
because there is no conscious knowledge of the
‘reason’ for the choice. This implies that there

E. Shaw, R. Blakey

110

must be a mechanism for confabulation, meaning
that given a certain amount of evidence, which
may or may not be misleading, part of the brain
will jump to the simplest conclusion.^
B….Your decisions are strongly prepared by brain
activity. By the time you become aware of what
you want to do, your brain waves have often
already given you away…^
B…scientists could force the subjects to choose to
move their left hands. But despite their choice
being electronically directed, these patients continued to report that they were freely choosing
which hand to move!^
These passages emphasise the ideas that behaviour is
caused by unconscious, rather than conscious processes
and that people are often mistaken about the real reasons
for their own behaviour. As Sie and Wouters have
pointed out, determinism can be distinguished from
B…the thesis that consciousness does not influence our
behaviour….Such a lack of influence (if true) would
threaten compatibilist and incompatibilist positions
alike.^[43:121].9
Nadelhoffer et al. have developed the Bfree will
inventory^ (FWI) a sophisticated tool for measuring
beliefs about free will, determinism and dualism and
the relationship between these beliefs and attitudes toward responsibility and punishment. The FWI overcomes many of the problems with previous tools of this
kind. One virtue of the FWI is that it distinguishes
between retributive and non-retributive reasons for
9
Shariff et al. also used certain items from the FAD and FAD-Plus
tools for measuring participants’ belief in free will, but they did not
select any of the items designed to measure belief in determinism.
Paulhus, D. L., & Margesson, A. 1994. Free Will and Scientific
Determinism (FAD-4) scale. Unpublished instrument, University of
British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada and Paulhus, D. L., &
Carey, J. M. 2011. The FAD–Plus: Measuring lay beliefs regarding
free will and related constructs. Journal of personality assessment,
93(1), 96–104. For an illuminating discussion of the limitations of
these tools see [41]. One of Shariff et al’s four studies contained a
reference to determinism in a manipulation check: Bto what degree do
you believe that humans have free will in the sense that we can
consciously generate spontaneous choices and actions, not fully determined by prior events?^. However, this statement is very brief and
participants may not have fully understood/paid attention to the phrase
Bdetermined by prior events^ and may have focused on the word
Bconsciously^, given the focus of the main passage they were asked
to read. Furthermore, for this item to distinguish between
compatibilists and incompatibilists it would have to be made clearer
that the statement is asserting that free will requires indeterminism, as
opposed to asserting that we have free will and our actions happen not
to be determined.

punishment. However, it does not contain any items that
are framed in terms of retributive versus non-retributive
senses of Bmoral responsibility^. The FWI could, however, be used in future research in an adapted form, or
alongside other materials in order to get another perspective on the questions raised in the present article
concerning the interpretation of the term Bmoral
responsibility^. Possible alterations to the FWI might
include modifying the wording of the statements about
responsibility in order to make a clearer distinction between compatibilists and libertarians. Currently, the FWI
contains two items that mention Bresponsibility^. One
item states: BTo be responsible for our present decisions
and actions we must also be responsible for all of our
prior decisions and actions that led up to the present
moment^. The phrase Bled up to^ could be interpreted
as meaning Bpreceded in time^ as opposed to Bpredetermined^. Neither compatibilists nor libertarians
would endorse the idea that to be responsible for any of
one’s actions one must also have been responsible for all
of one’s preceding actions (e.g. even childhood actions).
The second item states: BPeople could be morally responsible even if scientists discovered all of the laws that
govern human behavior.^ This statement does not rule
out the possibility that a) the laws governing human
behaviour are indeterministic (e.g. merely probabilistic)
or b) even after all the laws that do apply to humans have
been discovered, it will turn out that some aspects of
human behaviour are not law-governed. Therefore both
compatibilists and libertarians might agree with this
item. This is not a criticism of the FWI – this particular
item was intended to measure intuitions about the compatibility between responsibility and a Blaw governed
universe^ (which seems to leave it open whether the
universe is governed by deterministic laws).10
Explicit Versus Implicit Retributivism
Our finding that explicit rejection of retributivism correlated with more lenient sentencing was in line with
previous research by Carlsmith, and Shariff et al. [3838;
42]. It was not in line with research by Scurich and
Appelbaum that genetic evidence had neither an aggravating nor a mitigating effect on sentencing (but that
might be due to the possibility that participants in
10
However, the questions we investigated concerned the compatibility
between responsibility and determinism. If we were to use the FWI in
future research to investigate the questions raised in this article, we
would need to alter the wording of the responsibility items.

Determinism, Moral Responsibility and Retribution

Scurich and Appelbaum’s study might not have
interpreted the genetic evidence as being deterministic)
[44]. Our study aimed to go beyond the existing research
by investigating whether, after reading about determinism, participants who explicitly rejected retributivism
would also be implicitly retributive, in that they would
be more influenced by evidence of the offender’s blameworthiness than by evidence of his dangerousness when
recommending a sentence. Carlsmith had not investigated the impact of reading about determinism on implicit
versus explicit retributivism. Shariff et al. investigated
the effect of reading about mechanistic explanations of
behavior on the length of sentence participants recommended, where it was stipulated that the sentence would
not help to prevent recidivism or deter other offenders.
Our study took a different approach – we compared the
influence of different combinations of evidence about
the offenders’ degree of blameworthiness versus his
dangerousness on participants’ sentencing recommendations and also enabled participants to rate the influence that they believed this information had on their
sentencing decision. One possible limitation of our
study was our reliance on a description of the offender’s
motive as a way of indicating his blameworthiness. It is
possible that participants might have considered his
motive to be relevant to both his dangerousness and
his blameworthiness and thus to be relevant from both
a consequentialist and a retributive perspective. We
attempted to reduce this problem, by stipulating that
despite having a bad motive, the offender had been
assessed as having a very low risk of reoffending and
that when he had a good motive, he had been assessed as
having a very high risk of reoffending. The problem is
that many factors relating to an offender that courts
consider at the sentencing stage typically have some
relevance from both a retributive and a consequentialist
perspective – the difference in the relative weight
accorded to the each factor by different penal theories
is usually a matter of degree.

Part X: Future Directions
The results lend some support to our main hypotheses
(H1 and H2) that when participants are presented with a
dichotomous choice between judging an offender responsible or non-responsible for pre-determined behaviour, a proportion of participants will be motivated by
non-retributive reasons to hold the offender responsible.

111

These hypotheses generated the prediction that participants will be less motivated to hold the offender responsible when they realize that they can achieve their nonretributive goals without holding the offender responsible. Our hypotheses provide a possible explanation for
our preliminary findings However, follow-up studies
could be designed to test alternative explanations, e.g.
the possibility (mentioned in the previous section) that
the variation in the question lengths might have partly
influenced the results, and the possibility that some
participants might have misinterpreted the question
wording or the description of determinism in some
way. We therefore intend to repeat the study with different ways of formulating the responsibility question and
the description of determinism, to see if the effect
persists.
We plan to discover whether the apparent public
support for incompatibilism can be replicated in a future
study and to investigate why our study generated this
finding, whereas certain previous studies did not. We
also aim to investigate whether participants are more
likely to judge that responsibility is incompatible with
determinism if the description of determinism mentions
the brain (as it did in the present study). Nahmias et al.
[45] found some evidence that incompatibilist responses
are higher if determinism is described in neurobiological
rather than psychological terms. They suggested that
participants are more likely to assume that the individual’s conscious reasoning processes are bypassed by
forces outside their control if the causes of the person’s
behaviour are described in neurobiological rather than
psychological terms. There is a risk that participants
might confuse this bypassing issue with the concept of
determinism. We attempted to avoid this confusion by
repeatedly emphasising in the study that the offender
was motivated by reasons and asking relevant comprehension questions. Follow-up studies could shed light
on whether our attempts to avoid the bypassing problem
were successful.
Another issue for future research is why some participants in the present study judged that the offender Bnot
responsible^ for determined behaviour, but, nevertheless agreed (to some extent) with the statement that the
same offender had Bfree will^ and was Bblameworthy^.
This might have been due to participants forgetting
about the details of the description of determinism by
the time the question about free will and blameworthiness was asked. Rose, Buckwalter and Nichols [46]
suggest that a proportion of readers may be capable of

E. Shaw, R. Blakey

112

reverting to their default assumption that people have
indeterministic free will even when the description of
determinism remains on the screen throughout. However, when participants need to recall the information about
determinism, after some time has elapsed, there may be a
greater risk that their initial indeterministic intuitions will
lead them to misrecollect or ignore this information [47].
This could be tested by measuring the time gap between
reading the description of determinism and answering
the questions about free will, responsibility and blameworthiness and seeing whether compatibilist responses
increase as the time gap increases. In future studies we
would also investigate the concepts of Bfree will^ and
Bblameworthiness^ using two separate questions.
Finally, the reported study focused on the term
Bmoral responsibility^, but a similar methodology could
be adapted for studies on the use of the terms Bintention^
and Bfree will^. Future studies on the use of these latter
terms could usefully investigate the following question:
Does the effect of the Bdesire to punish^ on the interpretation of the terms Bintention^ and Bfree will^ disappear when participants are offered ways of achieving
their punishment goals without altering their interpretation of these terms?

responsible, in the basic, retributive sense. If this is
confirmed by future research, a wider implication would
be that theorists’ arguments against retributivism are
more likely to affect public attitudes to punishment
when non-retributive ways of achieving important punishment goals are emphasised. Our preliminary findings
also suggested that explicit retributivism did not correlate with implicit retributivism (although it seems that
the explicit rejection of retributivism did correlate with
more lenient sentencing).11 If this is confirmed in future
research, it would imply that free will theorists who wish
to affect public attitudes toward punishment should,
when communicating their research to the public, give
detailed consideration to the implications for
sentencing.

Conclusion
In this article, we identified two issues that deserve
greater attention from those researching lay people’s
attitudes to moral responsibility and determinism. The
first issue concerns whether people interpret the term
Bmoral responsibility^ in a retributive way and whether
they are motivated to hold offenders responsible for predetermined behaviour by considerations other than
retributivism, e.g. the desires to condemn the action
(as opposed to the actor) and to protect society. The
second issue concerns whether explicitly rejecting moral
responsibility and retributivism, after reading about determinism, would have any impact on Bimplicit^
retributivism when recommending a sentence for a hypothetical offender. We reported the results of an exploratory study that investigated these questions. Our preliminary findings raise the possibility that a significant
proportion of participants either i) may not interpret
Bmoral responsibility^ in the basic, retributive sense of
the term, which is at issue in the determinism debate, or
ii) may be unconsciously motivated by non-retributive
considerations to judge that the offender is morally

Abstract People who judge that a wrongdoer’s behaviour is determined are disposed, in certain cases,
to judge that the wrongdoer cannot be responsible for
his behaviour. Some try to explain this phenomenon
by arguing that people are intuitive incompatibilists
about determinism and moral responsibility. However, Peter Strawson argues that we excuse determined
wrongdoers because judging that someone is determined puts us into a psychological state – ‘the objective stance’ – which prevents us from holding
them responsible, not because we think that determined wrongdoers cannot be responsible. Two studies were completed to test the claim that the objective
stance prevents us from judging wrongdoers responsible. Implicit association measures revealed that participants primed in the objective stance appraised a
wrongdoer more positively, but as no less blameworthy, than those neutrally primed. These findings raise
doubts about Strawson’s explanation of our tendency
to excuse determined wrongdoers.

Introduction
People Sometimes Excuse Determined Wrongdoers
People who judge that a wrongdoer’s behaviour is determined are disposed, in certain cases, to judge that the
wrongdoer cannot be morally responsible for his behaviour. For instance, Nichols and Knobe [1] found that,
when presented with a low affect vignette describing a
wrongdoer acting in a deterministic universe (specifically, a tax cheat), only 23% of participants judged that it
was possible for the wrongdoer to be fully morally
responsible for his behaviour. In other cases, however,
people make different judgements. For instance, when
Nichols and Knobe presented participants with a high
affect vignette of a wrongdoer acting in a deterministic
universe (specifically, a serial rapist), 64% judged that
was possible for the wrongdoer to be fully morally
responsible (this replicates a similar finding of Nahmias
et al. [2]).
Roskies and Nichols [3] found that responsibility
judgements varied depending on whether participants
were told that determinism was true in the actual world
or, instead, in some non-actual world. When told that
determinism was true in a non-actual world, participants
tended to judge that wrongdoers in that world cannot be
responsible. However, when told that determinism was

100

true in the actual world, participants tended to judge that
actual wrongdoers can be responsible for their
behaviour.
The Supposed Intuitiveness of Incompatibilism
The purpose of these studies was to determine whether
people are intuitive ‘compatibilists’ or ‘incompatibilists’
about determinism and moral responsibility.
Compatibilism is the view that causal determinism and
moral responsibility are compatible; in other words, that
it is possible for a person to be morally responsible in a
deterministic universe. Incompatibilism is the view that
determinism and responsibility are incompatible. (There
is a related, but distinct, debate about the compatibility
of free will with determinism. However, in this paper,
we are only concerned with the question of moral responsibility.) When we say that someone is ‘morally
responsible’, or ‘blameworthy’, we mean that it is appropriate to blame her for her behaviour. And, by ‘determinism’, we mean the view that everything that happens at a time (including all human behaviour) is an
inevitable consequence of everything that happens before that time, given the laws of nature.
It is worth emphasizing that the psychological
debate about the intuitiveness of incompatibilism is
orthogonal to the philosophical debate about the truth
of incompatibilism. The psychological question,
which we are interested in, concerns whether the folk
intuitively think that responsibility is compatible with
determinism. But even if it turned out (for instance)
that incompatibilism was intuitively true, it wouldn’t
follow that determinism and moral responsibility
were, in fact, incompatible. This is a separate
question.
In addition to the vignette-based studies described
above, Nichols and Knobe also directly asked participants, in a separate experiment, whether they
thought a wrongdoer in a deterministic universe
could be fully morally responsible for his behaviour
[1]. They found that most participants (86%) answered ‘no’. One might take this finding alone to
constitute strong evidence in favour of the hypothesis
that people are incompatibilists about responsibility
and determinism. However, even if people are
incompatibilists, it remains unclear what role (if
any) this philosophical belief plays in their judgements about the responsibility of specific wrongdoers. This question is pressing in light of the mixed

D. B. Cohen et al.

findings outlined above, which make it clear that we
are not always inclined to excuse determined wrongdoers. It thus remains an open possibility that we
tacitly take responsibility and determinism to be
compatible in spite of our conscious commitment to
incompatibilism. One might also question the significance of people’s reported judgements that responsibility and determinism are incompatible in light of
the well-known unreliability of our introspective capacities (see the body of evidence surveyed in [4]).
For instance, upon observing that one tends to excuse
determined wrongdoers in certain cases, one might
mistakenly infer that one thinks that determinism and
responsibility are incompatible.
Whether we are tacit compatibilists or
incompatibilists thus seems to depend on which of the
different cases elicits our ‘deep’ judgement about
whether determinism and responsibility are compatible.
So, for instance, Nichols and Knobe attempt to explain
away the apparently compatibilist views of participants
in their high affect condition (and in Nahmias et al’s
study) by arguing that this condition evokes a kind of
performance error; they argue that responsibility judgements made in this condition reflect instinctive emotional reactions that do not reflect participants’ deep views
on the compatibility question. (Roskies and Nichols
explore a range of hypotheses that similarly discount
the compatibilist judgements observed in their study
concerning actual-world determined wrongdoers.) On
the other hand, Nichols and Knobe argue that our disposition to excuse determined wrongdoers in the low
affect condition does reveal a deep belief that determinism and moral responsibility are incompatible. Their
idea is that our implicit incompatibilism causes us to
excuse determined wrongdoers in this condition by
figuring in the following sort of reasoning: ‘wrongdoer
X is determined; determinism and responsibility are
incompatible; so, X cannot be responsible.’ In contrast,
as we will see, Strawson’s account of the causal process
leading us to excuse determined wrongdoers (a) does
not involve reasoning, and (b) does not require the
implicit belief that determinism and responsibility are
incompatible.
Similarly, Murray and Nahmias [5] argue that participants who excuse determined wrongdoers in the low
affect condition are not tacit incompatibilists. Murry and
Nahmias offer evidence that participants in the low
affect condition excuse determined wrongdoers because
they confuse determinism with a ‘bypassing thesis’

Responsibility, Determinism, and the Objective Stance: Using IAT to Evaluate Strawson’s Account of our...

which says that “agents’ mental states are bypassed in
the causal chains that lead to their behaviour” ([5], p.
434). However, the disposition to excuse a ‘bypassed
agent’ is clearly no evidence that we are tacit
incompatibilists about determinism properly understood and responsibility. Problematically, Murray and
Nahmias sometimes present their evidence differently,
arguing that participants excuse determined wrongdoers
because they mistakenly believe that determinism entails the bypassing thesis. But if one thinks that determinism entails bypassing and that bypassing entails that
people aren’t responsible, then (because of the transitivity of entailment) one is logically committed to
incompatibilism, i.e. the view that determinism and
responsibility are incompatible. So, if people excuse
determined wrongdoers because they believe that determinism entails bypassing, then they are, after all, tacit
incompatibilists. (Even if someone’s incompatibilism
rests on a mistaken view about what determinism entails, it doesn’t follow that theirs isn’t a genuine
incompatibilism. Nor does it follow that they misunderstand the thesis of determinism. It is quite possible to
have a false belief about what a thesis entails without
misunderstanding the thesis.) So, crucially, Murray and
Nahmias need to show that people excuse determined
wrongdoers because they have a false belief about what
‘determinism’ means, not merely about what determinism entails. (See [6] for further critical analysis of Murray and Nahmias.)
Our aim in this paper is to challenge Nichols and
K n o b e ’s a rg u m e n t f o r t h e i n t u i t i v e n e s s o f
incompatibilism by exploring another alternative explanation of our judgements in the low affect condition. We
focus, in particular, on an explanation which draws on
Peter Strawson’s celebrated discussion of moral responsibility [7]. This explanation is interesting in its own
right, as Strawson’s account of responsibility remains
highly influential but has not, to our knowledge, previously been utilised in this context. However, in the
course of two studies, we were unable to vindicate an
assumption central to Strawson’s theory. This result is
significant both because it undermines Strawson’s alternative explanation of our apparently incompatibilist
judgements and also because it calls his own widely
accepted account of responsibility into question. Ultimately, despite the failure of Strawson’s account, by
highlighting the viability of alternative explanations,
we aim to challenge the reasoning in Nichols and
Knobe’s argument that we are intuitive incompatibilists.

101

Strawson’s Theory of Responsibility
Peter Strawson’s pioneering discussion of moral responsibility [7] includes hypotheses about the psychology of
responsibility judgements which suggest an alternative
explanation of the correlation between the judgement
that determinism is true and the judgement that a person
cannot be responsible for her behaviour. The main tenet
of Strawson’s theory is that judgements of moral responsibility are emotional responses – ‘reactive attitudes’ –
prompted by the wrongdoing of others. The paradigmatic reactive attitudes, on Strawson’s view, are resentment
and indignation. While the specific details of Strawson’s
theory won’t matter for our purposes, it is worth noting a
subtle tension in the view. While Strawson thinks of the
reactive attitudes as being fundamentally ‘non-cognitive’ (non-belief-like) responses to wrongdoing (see
[8], p. 16), he also takes them to possess implicit cognitive content in at least two ways: (a) the reactive attitudes are specifically ‘targeted’ towards the ill-will underlying wrongful behaviour, and (b) the reactive attitudes express an ‘expectation’, or ‘demand’, that a
wrongdoer should not have shown ill-will.
Given this implicit content, it follows that responsibility judgements may sometimes be inappropriate. For
instance, someone deserves to be excused, on
Strawson’s view, when her behaviour exhibited no illwill (for instance, when someone kills another in selfdefence or out of ignorance). In this way, Strawson
makes room for a conceptual distinction between
‘blame’ (our affective response to wrongdoing, on
Strawson’s view) and our judgements of ‘blameworthiness’ (our judgements about whether a person deserves
blame). However, as we will see, Strawson elides this
distinction when he claims that, by suppressing someone’s reactive ‘blaming’ response towards a wrongdoer,
we thereby attenuate their judgement that the wrongdoer
is morally responsible (i.e. blameworthy).
Strawson’s Two Stances
When we are disposed to experience reactive emotions
towards others (thereby holding them responsible, on
Strawson’s theory), Strawson says that we take the
‘participant stance’ towards them. This is our default
orientation towards other people. There are times, however, when our emotional responses towards others are
dampened. In these cases, we shift away from the default participant stance and instead take an ‘objective’

102

stance towards others. When we take the objective
stance, we don’t deem resentment and indignation to
be inappropriate, as when we excuse wrongdoing. Rather, the objective stance involves a wholesale withdrawal
from the emotional engagement that characterises normal human interaction.
By outlining the different considerations that can
prompt us to shift to the objective stance, Strawson
seeks to explain some familiar patterns in our responsibility judgements. Out of Strawson’s rich discussion, we
may tease out (at least) three distinct kinds of situation
where we are inclined to take the objective stance towards a wrongdoer.

Exemption
In some cases, we take the objective stance towards
wrongdoers because we think the expectations
expressed by the reactive attitudes are unreasonable.
For instance, we may moderate our reactive responses
towards the wrongdoing of children believing that children are, in Strawson’s words, “morally underdeveloped” ([7], p. 79). For similar reasons, it is often said
that we should exempt those with diminished capacities,
such as kleptomaniacs (who have limited self-control)
and the insane (whose capacities to tell right from wrong
are compromised).

Practical Withdrawal
In cases of what we might call ‘practical withdrawal’,
we choose to retreat to the objective stance because it
is not useful, given our contingent purposes, to experience the reactive emotions. For instance, a clinical psychologist may choose to dampen her reactive
responses towards her patients “as a refuge from the
strains of involvement” ([7], pp. 79–80). Doing so
may both protect the psychologist from emotional
trauma and also help her do her job. Similarly, a
Judge may adopt the objective stance in the courtroom because she is worried that resentment and
indignation will undermine her ability to consider
people impartially. (While it is, of course, central to
a Judge’s job to allocate responsibility for wrongdoing, a Judge may worry that her holding people
responsible – by experiencing the reactive attitudes
– will undermine her impartiality.)

D. B. Cohen et al.

Scientific Withdrawal
In a suggestive passage, Strawson says that we may take
the objective stance towards “a ‘normal’ human being;
to concentrate, that is, on understanding ‘how he
works’, with a view to determining our policy accordingly or to finding in that very understanding a relief
from the strains of involvement” ([7], p. 82). In this
passage, Strawson again suggests that holding a person
responsible is not strictly required, even when there is
no question about her capacities; that one’s reactive
responses towards a wrongdoer may be suppressed for
reasons that have nothing to do with the wrongdoer
herself. Strawson here also suggests that this emotional
dampening may sometimes be involuntary. Specifically,
when we observe people ‘scientifically’ (with a view to
understanding ‘how they work’) we may find ourselves
incapable of experiencing the reactive emotions. In light
of these remarks, we propose to attribute a hypothesis to
Strawson which he does not explicitly articulate, as
follows:
One may be caused to take the objective stance as
a result of judging that a wrongdoer’s behaviour is
causally determined.
In his iconic commentary on Strawson’s paper, Jonathan Bennett interprets Strawson in a similar fashion:
“When we contemplate someone’s action as the
upshot of deterministic causes, we adopt the objective attitude towards him; our frame of mind
encourages questions like ‘What do we have here?
How did this come about?’ which naturally goes
with the question ‘How can we lessen (or increase) the chance that this will happen again?’
That objectivity of attitude dispels reactive feelings, and their disappearance presents itself to us
as the judgment that the person is not morally
accountable. …By actively raising the question
…—i.e. by thinking objectively about the
action—we get into a frame of mind in which
we cannot have reactive feelings; and their absence makes us reluctant to describe or treat the
person as morally accountable. Rather than moral
accountability’s being logically inconsistent with
each answer to the question, reactive feelings are
psychologically immiscible with the frame of
mind in which the question is asked. The answer
does not matter: the objectivity of attitude that

Responsibility, Determinism, and the Objective Stance: Using IAT to Evaluate Strawson’s Account of our...

frames the question does the real work” ([9], p. 57;
emphasis in the original).
The hypothesis, which we (following Bennett) are
attributing to Strawson, is that a certain pattern of
thought makes it practically impossible for us to maintain the participant stance towards others. This thoughtpattern involves thinking about a person ‘scientifically’,
by thinking about the causes of her behaviour (whether
deterministic, genetic, or environmental). In this this
way, the suggestion goes, we sometimes find ourselves
‘forced’ into the objective stance. The key implication,
for our purposes, is that we will find it difficult, if not
impossible, to hold wrongdoers responsible when we
believe that their behaviour is causally determined.
Strawson’s hypothesis, if correct, undercuts Nichols
and Knobe’s inference that people are intuitive
incompatibilists about determinism and responsibility.
(Their inference assumes that the intuitiveness of
incompatibilism is the only available explanation for
our disposition to excuse determined wrongdoers in
the low affect condition.) On Strawson’s view, we excuse determined wrongdoers because deterministic
thinking puts us into a psychological state which precludes us from holding others responsible, not because
we think that determined wrongdoers can’t be
responsible.
Strawson’s Argument for Compatibilism
Our main interest concerns Strawson’s alternative explanation of our supposedly incompatibilist judgements.
We take this argument to be implicit in Strawson’s text
but acknowledge that our reading of Strawson may be
unfamiliar. What is more familiar is Strawson’s argument for the compatibility of responsibility and determinism. Simply, Strawson argues that determinism is
not a factor that makes the reactive attitudes inappropriate. That is, even if determinism were true, it would not
follow that everyone was ‘morally incapacitated’; for
instance, it would not follow that everyone lacked either
the capacity for self-control or the capacity to tell right
from wrong. We mention this argument, however, only
in order to distinguish and set it aside, as we are primarily interested in Strawson’s explanation of why we are
inclined to excuse determined wrongdoers.
However, if Strawson’s explanation was correct – if
believing in determinism prevented one from holding
others responsible – one might worry that it would then

103

be impossible for someone to be both a determinist and
a compatibilist about responsibility and determinism.
But even if this were the case, it would not reveal any
inconsistency in Strawson’s overall position.
Compatibilism could be true (as Strawson argues) even
if it was impossible for a determinist to believe in
compatibilism. But in any case, the implication does
not follow. Suppose one believes determinism to be true.
If one is also a compatibilist, one will think that people
can nevertheless be responsible for wrongdoing. But
what if Strawson is correct that believing in determinism
prevents one from holding others responsible? In that
case, one will both think that anyone could be responsible, given the truth of determinism, and yet find oneself unable to hold anyone responsible. While there may
be something ironic in this predicament, it shows that
Strawson’s hypothesis does not preclude a determinist
from being a compatibilist.
Testing Strawson’s Theory
Strawson’s explanation of why we are inclined to excuse
determined wrongdoers consists in two hypotheses, as
follows:
i. Believing that a wrongdoer’s behaviour is determined causes us to take the objective stance towards
her; and
ii. Taking the objective stance towards a wrongdoer
prevents us from holding her responsible.
As we have seen, Strawson’s argument for (ii) is as
follows:
1. Taking the objective stance towards a wrongdoer
causes our reactive attitudes towards her (specifically resentment and indignation) to be suppressed.
2. We hold a person responsible by holding the reactive attitudes towards her.
3. So, taking the objective stance towards a wrongdoer
prevents us from holding her responsible.
If one’s negative attitudes towards a person are suppressed, one’s positive attitudes will become more salient. Thus, premise (1) of this argument implies a
further hypothesis, as follows:
iii. Taking the objective stance towards a wrongdoer
causes us to feel more positively towards her.

104

Our aim, in this paper, was to test hypotheses (ii) and
(iii). We didn’t specifically test hypothesis (i).
In order to test these hypotheses, we used implicit
association measures to compare the attitudes of participants who were primed to adopt the objective stance
towards a wrongdoer with the attitudes of participants
who were primed to adopt the participant stance towards
a wrongdoer. Our specific research questions were as
follows:
(a) Will participants primed to take the objective
stance towards a wrongdoer judge the wrongdoer
more positively than those primed to take the participant stance?
(b) Will participants primed to take the objective
stance towards a wrongdoer judge the wrongdoer
to be less blameworthy than those primed to take
the participant stance?
Following Strawson, we predicted affirmative answers to both questions.
Why Implicit Association?
Previous studies take the putative intuitiveness of
incompatibilism or compatibilism to be revealed
reliably by our conscious judgements about responsibility. But our conscious judgements are
formed as a result of unconscious processes and
judgements which may not be introspectively accessible [10]. For this reason, we worry that the
extant methodology (which relies on self-reported
judgements about responsibility) is blind to certain
relevant data. For instance, people may, in some
cases, hold unconscious judgements about responsibility which are not reflected in their conscious
judgements.
At the same time, the strongest effect of taking the
objective stance will likely be on participants’ unconscious attitudes and judgements. Of course, the objective stance may have some effect on participants’ conscious, introspectively accessible, judgements – but any
such effect will likely be weaker and harder to detect.
Thus, to investigate Strawson’s hypotheses, we
employed Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Because
IATs measure unconscious precursors to conscious
judgement, this approach gives us access to attitudes
that may not be available via introspection. This is one
reason why conscious and implicit attitudes are

D. B. Cohen et al.

imperfectly correlated [11]. IAT data is also less prone
to socially desirable responding, and sometimes constitutes better evidence of a person’s values and commitments than her explicit judgements. For instance, in
socially sensitive domains, implicit attitudes are better
predictors of behaviour than are explicit attitudes [12].
In an IAT, participants are presented with a series of
stimulus words and two response options, which are
labelled disjunctively. The task is to rapidly categorise
each stimulus into the correct option. For instance, the
two options might be labelled (a) ‘fish/green’, and (b)
‘mammal/red’. Given ‘puppy’ as a stimulus, the correct
categorisation is (b), and given ‘grass’ as a stimulus, the
correct categorisation is (a). Thus, there is never any
ambiguity concerning the correct categorisation of a
given stimulus. Nevertheless, the speed and accuracy
of participants’ categorisations will be affected by any
unconscious associations between the relevant and irrelevant terms in the response options. For instance, a
participant who associated ‘puppy’ with ‘green’ would
be slower and less accurate, on average, in picking
‘mammal/red’ than a participant with no such association, or than one who associated ‘puppy’ with ‘red’. In
this way, IAT allows us to measure unconscious associations between concepts, which may in turn constitute
evidence of unconscious attitudes and judgements [13].

Study 1
Method
Primes
Participants were presented with either an objective
stance prime or a participant stance prime, as follows,
prior to reading a vignette describing a wrongdoer.
Objective Stance Prime “You are going to be presented
with a short vignette describing the details of a court
case; while reading this try to understand the potential
impact and possible causes of Mick Newman’s behaviour. Please try to respond to the questions about Mick
with a view to understanding the causes and effects of
his behaviour.”
Participant Stance Prime “You are going to be presented with a short vignette describing the details of a court
case; while reading this try to imagine that you are an

Responsibility, Determinism, and the Objective Stance: Using IAT to Evaluate Strawson’s Account of our...

old friend of Mick Newman. Please try to respond to the
questions about Mick from the point of view of an old
friend.”
Vignette of the Wrongdoer
All participants were presented with the following
vignette:
“Mick Newman appeared in the Magistrates court
last week, charged with three counts of assault
occasioning actual bodily harm towards his stepson William. It was found that the assaults occurred while William had been left in his care
during a period of two weeks when William’s
mother had an affair with another man. In an
attempt to discipline William for wetting the bed,
Mick had left William with severe bruises on his
arms and back. Mick had also withheld meals as
part of William’s punishment. In his defence,
Mick’s lawyers argued that Mick had no previous
experience with child-care. Mick’s only model of
parenting came from his own experience as a
seriously abused child who was eventually removed from the care of his natural parents at the
age of eight and put into the foster system.”
On Strawson’s view, the objective stance is
prompted by thinking of the causes of a wrongdoer’s behaviour (with a focus either on understanding, or on treating the behaviour). This vignette thus includes explanatory factors for participants to focus on if they take the objective stance
towards Mick Newman. The Vignette was also
accompanied by a set of photographs of a man
identified as Mick Newman. As facial recognition
prompts a ready emotional engagement with others,
we used photographs to re-identify Mick Newman
in our IATs in order to test whether participants’
emotional responses to Mick Newman would be
affected by the stance taken towards him. (In the
course of each IAT, we also employed a set of
photographs of an ‘innocent stranger’ – i.e. someone not identified as a wrongdoer – as a control.)
Participants
Participants were undergraduate psychology students
who were recruited online via Charles Sturt University’s
Research Experience System, which allows students to

105

participate in studies as an optional way to obtain course
credit. The present participants chose this study out of a
range of available studies.
An a priori sample size calculation (Power = .8, Effect size = .65, α = .05) revealed that the minimum
sample size was 39 participants in each group.
Participants - Prime 1 (Objective Stance)
A total of 53 participants (40 females and 12 males and 1
participant who did not disclose their gender) were primed
to take the objective stance. A manipulation check was
completed in order to determine whether participants had
evaluated the wrongdoer in terms of the causes and effects
of his behaviour. Only data from participants who indicated that they took this stance were included in the analysis.
Data from 7 participants were excluded on this basis,
leaving a total of 46 participants in this group (34 females
and 12 males, Mean age = 37.28, SD = 10.01).
Participants - Prime 2 (Participant Stance)
A total of 43 participants (32 females, 11 males) were
primed to take the participant stance. A manipulation
check was completed in order to determine whether participants had evaluated the wrongdoer from the perspective
of an old friend. Only data from participants who indicated
that they took this stance were included in the analysis.
Data from 2 participants were excluded on this basis,
leaving a total of 41 participants in this group (30 females
and 11 males, Mean age = 35.78, SD = 11.18).
Manipulation Checks
Our manipulation checks consisted of the following
three questions:
(a) “While reading the scenario, what perspective were
you asked to take?” (Participants who didn’t indicate the appropriate perspective were excluded.)
(b) “How successfully do you think you were able to
take that perspective?” (Participants responded on
a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = ‘not at all successfully’;
10 = ‘very successfully’). Participants who gave
scores below 4 were excluded.)
(c) “Did you have any problems completing the
task(s)?” (Participants who indicated that they forgot which perspective they were meant to take
were excluded.)

106

Measures and Procedure
The study was completed online using the Inquisit platform. Consent was implied by submission of the completed measures. All participants completed the implicit
measures before the explicit measures.
Implicit Measures
We developed two IATs for the present study.
For IAT1 – Positive/Negative – we selected a
series of words, expressing either positive or negative
evaluations (see Appendix 1 Table 3). We explored
whether participants were more likely to associate a
wrongdoer with ‘positive words’ if they took the
objective stance towards him, and whether they were
more likely to associate the wrongdoer with ‘negative
words’ if they took the participant stance towards
him. (Strawson predicts that the stance one takes
towards a person is a common cause for a related
range of either positive or negative evaluations.)
For IAT2 – Blame/Innocence – we selected a series
of words, all expressing judgements of innocence or
blameworthiness (see Appendix 2 Table 4). We investigated whether participants were more likely to associate
a wrongdoer with ‘innocent words’ if they took the
objective stance towards him, and whether they were
more likely to associate the wrongdoer with ‘blameworthy words’ if they took the participant stance towards
him. (Strawson predicts that the stance one takes towards a person is a common cause for a related range
of judgements broadly expressing the idea that someone
is blameworthy or innocent).
(When we judge that someone is ‘innocent’, we may
mean either that they didn’t do anything wrong, or that
they aren’t blameworthy for some wrong which they did
do. However, IAT2 clearly measured participants’ implicit judgements of Mick’s ‘innocence’ in the second of
these senses. Note that the word ‘innocent’ was not
included in the list of ‘innocent words’.)
Order of presentation of the implicit association measures was counterbalanced. Stimuli and procedure for
the IAT measures are depicted in Appendices 1 and 2
Tables 3 and 4.
Explicit Measures
In addition to measuring unconscious judgements of
responsibility (using IAT), we also measured conscious

D. B. Cohen et al.

judgements in order to determine whether conscious and
unconscious judgements of responsibility can diverge.
Participants were asked to indicate on a scale of 1 to 100
(1 = ‘not at all’; 100 = ‘extremely’) the degree to which
they felt the following with respect to Mick Newman:
warm, cold, angry, and resentful. Participants also indicated, on a scale of 1 to 100, how innocent, responsible,
and blameworthy they perceived Mick Newman to be
(1 = ‘not at all’; 100 = ‘completely’).

Results and Discussion
Implicit Positive/Negative Appraisals
No significant difference emerged in the degree to
which participants implicitly associated the wrongdoer
(Mick Newman) with positive emotions as a function of
prime type. Positive/Negative IAT: objective prime
(M = .04, SD = .42); participant prime (M = .03, SD =
.43), t(84) = −.05, p = .96, d = .011, mean difference
(MD) = −.005, 95% CI MD [−.177, −.187].

Implicit Attributions of Responsibility
No significant difference emerged in the degree to
which participants implicitly associated the wrongdoer
(Mick Newman) with blameworthiness as a function of
prime type. Blame/Innocence IAT: objective prime
(M = .05, SD = .52); participant prime (M = .07, SD =
.45), t(85) = −.18, p = .86, d = .039, mean difference
(MD) = −.019, 95% CI MD [−.190, −.229].

Explicit Positive/Negative Appraisals and Attributions
of Responsibility
There was only one significant difference between
the two groups in explicit appraisals of Mick Newman: the objective prime group indicated less anger
towards Mick Newman than the participant prime
group, t(85) = −2.19, p = .03, d = .40, mean differe n c e ( M D ) = 11 . 0 4 2 , 9 5 % C I M D [ − 1 . 0 0 5 ,
−21.079]. P values for explicit judgements of
warmth, coldness, resentment, innocence, blameworthiness and responsibility ranged from .08 to .99.
Means and standard deviations for all explicit measures are presented in Table 1.

Correlations between Implicit and Explicit Measures
No significant correlations were found between explicitly reported attitudes and implicit attitudes for either the
participant prime group or the objective prime group.
Questions Arising
According to Strawson, we are naturally disposed (within in the participant stance) to adopt negative reactive
attitudes towards wrongdoers. So, Strawson would predict that when we adopt the objective stance towards a
wrongdoer – thereby suppressing our reactive attitudes
– we will become more positively disposed towards
them. Given that the prime used in the present study
did not affect implicit feelings of warmth or responsibility judgements, we used a different prime to induce
the objective stance in Study 2.

Study 2
Method
Primes
A second study was conducted in which participants were
also primed to adopt either the participant or objective
stance towards a wrongdoer. However, the primes used
in Study 2 differed from those adopted in Study 1. For
Study 1, participants in the objective prime group were
required to view Mick Newman ‘scientifically’; that is, to
focus on the causes and effects of his behaviour. For Study
2, participants in the objective prime group were required
to adopt the role of psychologist in their judgment of Mick

107

Newman. Our aim was to test whether this role-related
objective stance prime was more effective than the ‘scientific’ objective stance prime employed in Study 1 in affecting participants’ attitudes towards Mick Newman.
This prime was selected in light of Strawson’s observation that professional roles, like that of a psychologist,
can require one to adopt the objective stance. We often
say, for instance, that a psychologist must be ‘professionally detached’ in order to help her clients. While this
doesn’t necessarily entail setting aside all emotional
engagement, it does require a psychologist to set aside
her reactive emotions. Given this, when imagining oneself as a psychologist who is engaged professionally
with a wrongdoer, one should be inclined to supress
one’s reactive attitudes towards the wrongdoer.
We also employed a different prime for the participant
stance group in Study 2. As participants were easily induced to take the participant stance as a result of being told
to think of Mick Newman as an old friend (only 2 participants indicated that they did not adopt this stance, compared to 7 in the objective prime group), we wanted to test
Strawson’s claim that the participant stance is our default
attitude towards others. By changing the participant stance
prime, we also averted a confound which may have
distorted our findings in Study 1. As people are inclined
to forgive friends more readily than strangers [14], this
could account for our finding (in Study 1) that those
primed to take the participant stance were no more inclined
to hold Mick responsible for his wrongdoing and no less
inclined to feel positively towards Mick than those primed
to take the objective stance. Thus, in Study 2, we used a
more neutral prime, instructing participants merely to think
of Mick Newman as someone they read about in the
newspaper.
Participants were presented with either an objective
stance prime or a participant stance prime, as follows,
prior to reading the vignette of the wrongdoer.
Objective Stance Prime “You are going to be presented
with a short vignette describing the details of a court
case; while reading this you are to imagine yourself as
the psychologist of Mick Newman. It is important that
you attempt to think about the case and Mick Newman,
the way a psychologist would.”
Participant Stance Prime “You are going to be presented with a short vignette describing the details of a
court case; while reading this you are to imagine reading
it in a newspaper. It is important that you try and

108

imagine yourself reading this as if you were reading it
from a newspaper.”

Results and Discussion
Implicit Positive/Negative Appraisals

Participants
An a priori sample size calculation (Power = .8, Effect
size = .65, α = .05) revealed that the minimum sample
size was 39 participants in each group.
Participants - Prime 1 (Objective Stance)
A total of 88 participants (63 females and 25 males) were
primed to take the objective stance. A manipulation check
was completed in order to determine whether participants
had adopted the stance of a psychologist when evaluating
the wrongdoer. Only data from participants who indicated
that they adopted this stance were included in the analysis.
Data from 13 participants were excluded on this basis,
leaving a total of 75 participants in this group (55 females
and 20 males, Mean age = 32.28, SD = 10.18).
Participants - Prime 2 (Participant Stance)

Positive/Negative IAT: Participants primed to take the
objective stance towards the wrongdoer implicitly appraised the wrongdoer significantly more positively
(M = .17, SD = .38) than those primed to take the participant stance (M = −.04, SD = .44), t(137) = −2.86,
p = .005, d = .45, mean difference (MD) = −.199, 95%
CI MD [−.061, −.338].
Implicit Attributions of Responsibility
There was no significant difference in the degree to
which participants implicitly associated the wrongdoer
with blameworthiness or innocence as a function of
prime type. Blame/Innocence IAT: objective prime
(M = .03, SD = .43); participant prime (M = .05, SD =
.45), t(137) = −.16, p = .87, d = .029, mean difference
(MD) = −.012, 95% CI MD [−.135, −.160].
Participant Stance Prime

A total of 73 participants (49 females and 24 males)
were primed to adopt the participant stance. A manipulation check was completed in order to determine
whether participants had adopted the stance of someone
reading about the case in a newspaper or magazine when
evaluating the wrongdoer. Only data from participants
who indicated that they adopted this stance were included in the analysis. Data from 9 participants were excluded on this basis, leaving a total of 64 participants in this
group (41 females and 23 males, Mean age = 32.78,
SD = 11.71).

The participant stance groups in both studies were equally
inclined both to feel negatively towards the wrongdoer
(Study 1: M = −.034, SD = .429; Study 2: M = .036, SD =
.442), t(103) = −.801, p = .425, d = .16, mean difference
(MD) = .069, 95% CI MD [−.244, .103], and to hold him
responsible (Study 1: M = −.067, SD = .446; Study 2:
M = .046, SD = .453), t(103) = −1.247, p = .215, d = .25,
mean difference (MD) = −.112, 95% CI MD [−.291, .066].
This suggests that the more neutral prime employed in
Study 2 was as effective as that used in Study 1.

Manipulation Checks

Explicit Positive/Negative Appraisals and Attributions
of Responsibility

The same manipulation checks adopted in Study 1 were
also used in Study 2. These will not therefore be repeated here.
Measures and Procedure
The vignette of the wrongdoer and implicit association
measures adopted in Study 1 were also used in Study 2.
Only the primes used in the two studies differed (as
described above). A description of the measures and
procedure will not therefore be repeated here.

There were no significant differences in explicitly reported feelings of warmth, coldness, anger, or resentment, or judgements of innocence, blameworthiness or
responsibility between the different primes (p values
ranged from .22 to .49). Means and standard deviations
are presented in Table 2.
These findings show that conscious and unconscious
attitudes towards a wrongdoer may diverge. Participants
primed to take the objective stance towards a wrongdoer
implicitly felt more positively towards a wrongdoer than
those primed to take the participant stance. But this shift

in attitude did not manifest in participants’ explicit attitudes. The use of implicit measures thus promises a
deeper insight into our attitudes and judgements than
is revealed by explicit measures alone.
Correlations between Implicit and Explicit Measures
For the objective prime condition, scores on the Blame/
Innocence IAT were significantly positively correlated
with explicitly reported warmth (r = .31, p = .008) and
negatively correlated with explicitly reported coldness
(r = −.25, p = .03). Thus, the more a person implicitly
evaluated Mick Newman as innocent the more warmth
and less coldness they explicitly reported feeling towards him. For the participant prime condition, scores
on the Blame/Innocence IAT were significantly negatively correlated with explicitly reported coldness (r =
−.25, p = .04). Thus, the more an individual implicitly
associated the wrongdoer with innocence, the less coldness they explicitly reported feeling towards him.
For both the objective prime and participant prime
groups, there were no significant associations between
scores on the Positive/Negative IAT and explicit measures.

General Discussion
Implications for Strawson
In light of our findings, let’s now consider the three hypotheses which we attributed to Strawson in Section 1.6.
Hypothesis 1: Believing that a wrongdoer’s behaviour is determined causes one to take the objective
stance towards her.

109

While we didn’t specifically aim to test Strawson’s
first hypothesis, nevertheless, the ineffectiveness of our
‘scientific’ prime (Study 1) in affecting participants’
emotional attitudes towards a wrongdoer is evidence
that scientific thinking doesn’t bring on the objective
stance. If one takes determinism to involve scientific
thinking about the world on a grand scale, then the
ineffectiveness of this prime is prima facie evidence
against Strawson’s first hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2: Taking the objective stance towards a
wrongdoer prevents us from holding her responsible.
In neither study were participants primed to take the
objective stance more likely to associate the wrongdoer
with innocence. We thus have evidence against
Strawson’s second hypothesis. (Some may reject our
attribution of Hypothesis 1 to Strawson. However, it is
uncontroversial that Strawson makes Hypothesis 2. So,
insofar as our findings undermine this hypothesis, our
challenge to Strawson stands free of our perhaps controversial reading of his text.)
One might find countervailing evidence in support of
Hypothesis 2 in a study by Small and Loewenstein [15],
where it was found that participants who cooperated in a
prisoner’s dilemma game were more inclined to blame and
punish an identified, compared to an anonymous, fellowparticipant who defected in the game. This effect was
mediated by participants’ sense of anger towards the defector. The authors conclude that identifiability affects the
inclination to blame and punish a wrongdoer by evoking
stronger negative emotions towards the wrongdoer. This,
in turn, suggests that suppressing one’s negative emotions
towards a wrongdoer will decrease the likelihood of one’s
blaming the wrongdoer. However, while this result may
indicate that our disposition to blame others requires underlying negative attitudes, it does not illuminate whether
our judgements of blameworthiness require similar underlying negative attitudes. Yet Hypothesis 2 concerns judgements of blameworthiness, not blame. (This study also
contrasts with our own insofar as participants reacted to
personal wrongdoing. We could have adopted this feature
in our study, perhaps by asking participants to imagine that
they themselves were victims of Mick Newman. But while
this may have magnified participants’ reactive emotions
towards Mick, this magnification would apply equally
across both priming conditions and so would be unlikely
to reveal further prime-dependent differences in attitude
towards him.)

110

D. B. Cohen et al.

Hypothesis 3: Taking the objective stance towards a
wrongdoer causes us to feel more positively towards her.
In keeping with our expectations, prime type did
have an effect on participants’ attitudes towards the
wrongdoer. In particular, in Study 2, participants primed
to take the objective stance implicitly evaluated the
wrongdoer more positively than those primed to take
the participant stance. This finding thus supports
Strawson’s third hypothesis.
In combination with the evidence against Hypothesis
2, this finding suggests that adopting the objective
stance may have certain practical benefits. Specifically,
by adopting this stance, it seems that we may avoid
unnecessary hostility towards wrongdoers without losing our moral perspective of them.
Strawson’s Theory of Responsibility Judgement
On Strawson’s view, to hold a wrongdoer responsible is
just to hold certain negative attitudes towards him. But
even though adopting the objective stance suppressed
participants’ negative emotional responses towards a
wrongdoer in Study 2, these participants were no less
inclined to hold the wrongdoer responsible. Thus, the
negative emotions repressed by taking the objective stance
don’t appear to have been necessary in order for participants to hold the wrongdoer responsible. Our findings thus
constitute indirect evidence against Strawson’s theory of
responsibility judgement.

But we think that this way of defining the two stances is
problematic. Strawson’s main strategy, after all, is to explain why we hold others responsible by appealing to the
stance we take towards them. Similarly, as we have seen,
according to Bennett’s interpretation of Strawson, we can
explain why we are not disposed to hold determined
wrongdoers responsible by postulating that seeing someone as determined causes us to take the objective stance
towards them. However, these become empty ‘dormative
virtue’ explanations, according to the proposed definition
of the two stances. It is not illuminating to say that we hold
others responsible when and because we are disposed to
hold others responsible. Nor is it illuminating to say that
we don’t hold determined wrongdoers responsible because
judging that someone is determined renders us undisposed
to hold them responsible.
In light of these considerations, we think that it is better
to understand the two stances as distinctive attitudes
governed by one’s contingent goal in relating to another
person. So, if one’s goal is to understand someone ‘objectively’ (perhaps as necessary given one’s professional
role), then one takes the objective stance towards her;
whereas if one’s goal is to participate in normal human
relations with someone, then one takes the participant
stance towards her. On this alternative approach, it remains
an open question whether one will continue holding a
wrongdoer responsible once one takes the objective stance
towards him. This understanding of the two stances also
justifies the kind of approach we took in priming participants to adopt each of the two stances.
Nichols and Knobe’s argument for the intuitiveness
of incompatibilism

How Might Strawson Respond to these Findings?
Some define the participant and objective stances in terms
of our propensity to hold others responsible. On this view,
one takes the participant stance towards someone only if
one is disposed to hold them responsible under appropriate
circumstances, and one takes the objective stance towards
someone only if one is not disposed, under any circumstances, to hold them responsible (see, for instance, [16]
pp. 323–4). Taking this approach, Strawson could reject
our claim to have successfully primed participants to take
the objective stance towards Mick, our wrongdoer. On this
view, the very fact that participants in the objective prime
condition were no less inclined to hold Mick responsible
for his wrongdoing in fact proves that they maintained the
participant stance towards him.

In concluding, let’s return to evaluate Nichols and
K n o b e ’s a rg u m e n t f o r t h e i n t u i t i v e n e s s o f
incompatibilism. We might reconstruct their argument
in the following way:
1. In certain cases, people who judge that a wrongdoer’s
behaviour is determined tend to judge that the wrongdoer cannot be responsible for her behaviour.
2. So, in these cases, people tacitly think that determinism rules out responsibility.
But this argument is unsound. First, the conclusion
isn’t entailed by the premise: it is possible for someone
to think that determined wrongdoers cannot
be responsible for their behaviour in certain cases, yet

Responsibility, Determinism, and the Objective Stance: Using IAT to Evaluate Strawson’s Account of our...

not to think that determinism rules out responsibility in
those cases. Nor does the conclusion obviously best
explain the premise. As we have seen, there are plausible cognitive (belief-based) and non-cognitive (non-belief-based) explanations of the correlation between the
judgement that a wrongdoer is determined and the
judgement that the wrongdoer cannot be responsible
for her behaviour. Neither of these other explanations
involves a believed entailment between the two judgements. Rather, on both alternative views, the link between the two judgements is mediated: either by a
further judgement (on the cognitive view) or by a state
of mind (on the non-cognitive view). On a cognitive
explanation of the correlation, people tend to judge that
determined wrongdoers are not responsible because
they believe that if a person’s behaviour is determined,
this causes some further fact which precludes responsibility. For instance, people might think that being determined causes one’s reasoning to bypass one’s behaviour
(a possible interpretation of the findings presented by
Murray & Nahmias [5]). Strawson, as we have seen,
offers a non-cognitive explanation of the correlation.
His suggestion is that people tend to excuse determined
wrongdoers because judging that someone’s behaviour
is determined causes one to enter a state of mind (the
objective stance) that prevents one from judging people
to be responsible.

Conclusion
While considered a classic paper in the field, the empirical
hypotheses in Strawson [7] have not previously been
identified or tested. Although we found only limited support for Strawson’s account of our responsibility judgements, further work is merited to determine whether the
objective stance suppresses either the reactive attitudes or
the disposition to hold people responsible for their actions.
Additional enquiry is also required to test Strawson’s claim
that belief in determinism is sufficient to induce the objective stance, and to explore other avenues for inducing the
objective stance. As existing research in this area may be
ignoring relevant data about unconscious judgements and
associations, it is worth further exploring techniques such
as IAT which are sensitive to these factors. We have argued
that the correlational data relied upon by Nichols and
Knobe is insufficient evidence for the intuitiveness of
incompatibilism. This may be an instance of a more widespread methodological issue in this area of research.

Abstract The brain disease model of addiction is widely endorsed by agencies concerned with treating behavioral disorders and combatting the stigma often associated with addiction. However, both its accuracy and its
effectiveness in reducing stigma have been challenged.
A proposed alternative, the “choice” model, recognizes
the residual rational behavior control capacities of
addicted individuals and their ability to make choices,
some of which may cause harm. Since harmful choices
are ordinarily perceived as blameworthy, the choice
model may inadvertently help justify stigma. This paper
seeks to fully naturalize the choice model by highlighting the determinants of voluntary action and thus increase its potential for destigmatizing addiction. In light
of a deterministic understanding of behavior, it is unreasonable to suppose that addicted individuals could have
made different choices in becoming addicted and in
subsequent situations. To the extent that stigma is motivated by the supposition that addicted individuals
could have chosen otherwise in actual situations, a deterministic understanding of addictive behavior promises to mitigate blame and stigma.

Introduction: Models of Addiction
The brain disease model of addiction is widely endorsed
in the drug prevention and treatment community as a
means to reduce stigma [1]. It is portrayed as a more
scientific and more compassionate understanding of
addiction than the so-called moral model since diseases
are not typically seen as blameworthy failures of character or will. The disease process, not the person, is
primarily to blame for addictive behavior because it
generates urges and impulses that overpower normal
capacities for self-control. However, skepticism is
growing about the cogency of the disease model and
its efficacy in combatting stigma and promoting recovery [2–6]. Disease model skeptics can agree with proponents that, as substance use (including use of alcohol
and nicotine) continues, the brain changes in ways that
help explain the syndromes typical of addiction: persistent drug-seeking and consumption that significantly
compromise an individual’s physical and psychological
welfare and hinder pursuit of non-drug-related goals.
However, they argue, addiction itself is more accurately
characterized as a person-level disorder of behavior,
behavior that, although often dysfunctional, is also
decision-laden and goal-directed. A choice model therefore best captures the nature of addiction: addicted individuals retain at least some impulse control and choicemaking capacities, capacities that can be leveraged in
treating the disorder itself [7–12].
The choice model recognizes the important voluntary
aspect of addictive behavior: that persons with drug
addiction consciously seek out and consume their

220

preferred substance(s), successfully negotiating barriers
to obtaining them. Although they may suffer impairments in the ability to plan or act on long-term goals,
they can imagine counterfactual scenarios (where and
how might I next obtain drugs?), deliberate, and eventually choose among them in order to maximize the
chances of satisfying cravings or avoiding withdrawal.
Given a motivational hierarchy that makes drug consumption the top priority, such behavior counts as rational since it takes into account the possible contingencies
involved when pursuing an intended objective. It is not
merely a matter of involuntary motor reflex or blind
compulsion. True, from the perspective of those not in
the grip of addiction, such behavior is patently irrational, given the damaging consequences of drug use and
the failure to pursue a normal suite of life-enhancing
goals. It’s a relatively easy choice, for the non-addicted,
to refrain from damaging substance use, but not once
addiction takes hold. Even from the addicted perspective, in sober moments the global irrationality of one’s
behavior may be appreciated: one’s continuing failures
to keep resolutions to not use drugs, to meet obligations,
to achieve life ambitions. But although the motivational
priorities of those struggling with addiction might be
radically disordered, enough impulse control and
choice-making capacities remain to enable the intelligent pursuit of drugs. Under the choice model, it is these
remaining capacities that can be recruited to recover
from addiction, a process of reconfiguring one’s motivational priorities so that the scope of voluntary behavior expands beyond, and leaves behind, the use of drugs.
For those worried about stigma, the hazard of
adopting the choice model, however well it might capture the nature of addiction, is that it might return us to
the moral model. Choices, after all, are normally understood as the free, uncoerced expressions of an individual’s character, motives, and values, and unless morally
questionable choices have salient antecedents in circumstances beyond an individual’s control, they are ordinarily deemed blameworthy. As an expression of moral
blame, the stigma attached to addiction seems logically
to follow from characterizing it as involving voluntary
choices, not, as the disease model characterizes it, an
involuntary disease process.
In what follows. I will press the issue of the
causal determinants of voluntary action with the
aim of mitigating blame and stigma, but without
eliminating or ignoring the moral dimension of addictive behavior. The choice model need not return

T. W. Clark

us to the moral model even though moral considerations still apply. In this endeavor I join others, such
as Hanna Pickard [13] (see below, “Rethinking
blame in addressing addiction”), who seek less punitive and more effective modes of treating addiction. Although causal determinism is arguably a
working assumption when adducing science-based
explanations of behavior, behavioral scientists and
clinicians rarely make it explicit; nor are its implications for mitigating stigma, as argued for below,
usually spelled out in any detail. Explicating determinism – sometimes misunderstood (perhaps even
by some clinicians) as a threat to agency and accountability – may therefore help to increase acceptance by the therapeutic community of a properly
nuanced choice model, and adoption of more compassionate and effective approaches to addiction.

Moral Harms and the Harm of Stigma
It is uncontroversial that the harms incurred by addictive behavior often have a moral dimension. The
deception, negligence, theft, and broken promises
sometimes involved in addiction are normative transgressions that may directly impact others. Such
harms help to explain the stigma attached to addiction and why the moral model still holds sway in
some quarters. Stigmatization – engaging in condemnation or disapproval, whether by act or omission – is
an expression of blame that can serve to maintain
social norms [9]. The stigma attached to addiction
should therefore come as no surprise. It arises from
our natural, emotion-laden response to norm violations, not out of the blue as a completely irrational
prejudice on the part of those who stigmatize. Of
course, no one deliberately chooses to become
addicted [14], and there are often obvious predisposing environmental factors, such as parental and peer
drug use, as well as genetic susceptibilities to addiction; when pointed out, these can reduce perceived
responsibility for having become addicted. Nevertheless, voluntary choices to use drugs commonly
known to be addictive may be seen as retroactively
blameworthy should an addiction ensue, and once
addicted, the choice to engage in harmful addictive
behavior is prototypically blameworthy as conceived
under the moral model, thus potentially deserving of
stigmatization.

Determinism and Destigmatization: Mitigating Blame for Addiction

The Harm of Stigma
Although stigma may sometimes play a role in
correcting bad behavior, the stigma attached to addiction
has its own harmful consequences [13, 15]. Acceptance
of stigma reinforces the perception that addicted persons
deserve social punishment – disdain, condemnation,
ostracism – not help. Clinicians who harbor prejudicial
attitudes may avoid engaging with addicted patients,
prolonging their distress, and keeping them and others
at risk of further harm [16]. As targets of stigma, persons
with addictions may feel shame, leading them to conceal
their condition and preventing them from seeking treatment. Even if stigma sometimes helps to discourage
drug consumption and the resulting harms, it fails as
an effective, humane response to addiction. Reducing
stigma and developing effective but non-punitive approaches to behavioral disorders are thus worthy public
health objectives.

221

making blameworthy choices, whether in the process of
becoming addicted or in the pursuit of drugs. In response to this dilemma, I suggest that an explicitly
deterministic understanding of voluntary behavior and
choice-making, were it championed by behavioral scientists, clinicians and their clients, would help to reduce
stigma by placing the addicted individual fully within
the causal context of a choice.
In what follows, and as it is usually defined in philoscientific (philosophical and scientific) literature, causal
determinism holds when, given current circumstances
and laws of nature, there is a single next possible state of
affairs [21]. Determinism may not be universally the
case due to inherent randomness or indeterminism in
the world, including in human persons. However, I will
argue that since indeterminism cannot add to or enhance
control or responsibility, we are justified for all practical
purposes in taking a deterministic view of human behavior, including the voluntary choices involved in addiction. I call this pragmatic determinism.

Limitations of the Disease Model in Reducing Stigma
Despite its current popularity, the disease model strategy
against stigma faces at least two difficulties. First, as
noted above, voluntary behavior and contingencyresponsive choices figure centrally in addiction, both
in its inception and further expression. Addicted persons
can therefore be understood as at least partially responsible for becoming addicted, and for continuing to make
choices that sometimes incur harm. Thus, stigma may be
perceived as fairly applied to those with addictions,
should they behave badly.
Second, attitudinal research suggests that the disease
model may not reduce stigma to the extent its proponents
might hope. Characterizing addiction as essentially an
involuntary, physical brain disorder may increase pessimism about possible recovery and highlights the risks of
deviant or harmful behavior due to deficits in self-control,
with the unintended consequence of encouraging social
distance [17–20]. Those who suffer from uncontrollable
compulsions due to a brain disease may be perceived as
less trustworthy and predictable, perhaps even dangerous
[19], so are more likely to be shunned or avoided.
The upshot is that those with addictions may end up
stigmatized either way: if you can’t control yourself
because addiction is a brain disease, you can’t be trusted
and perhaps constitute an indefinite burden of care. If
you can control yourself, at least to some extent, as the
choice model holds, then you can be stigmatized for

Determinism Vs. the Contra-Causal Assumption
If, as choice model theorists propose, addiction is essentially a disorder of one’s motivational architecture within which voluntary choices are made, then understanding the etiology of that architecture and the resulting
choices is a logical goal of addiction research. Taking
this charge to heart, we must examine assumptions that
work to block the full investigation of the determinants
of choice, in particular the idea that we have the capacity
to transcend causal determinism when making choices,
what I will call the contra-causal assumption. This has it
that, in most actual situations, individuals could have
chosen or acted otherwise even given the exact causes
and circumstances in play; we have, as philosophers
sometimes put it, the unconditional ability to do otherwise.1 Recent survey data and experimental findings
1
The unconditional ability to do otherwise contrasts with the conditional
ability, which holds that had, counterfactually, the set of conditions been
relevantly different, a different choice or action might have resulted had
the agent possessed the capacity to respond otherwise. The conditional
ability to do otherwise is thus compatible with determinism since the
imagined change in circumstances causes the imagined change in behavior. Contrary to the position taken here, compatibilists (who hold
that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism)
sometimes claim that the conditional ability is sufficient to justify credit
or blame for voluntary choices in the “basic desert” sense; see “Rethinking blame in addressing addiction” below and note 5.

222

suggest that belief in having this ability may be prevalent [22–25]. A deterministic view of human agency –
that the causes in actual situations, both inside and
outside the person, necessitate the resulting behavior
(any indeterminism aside) – obviously calls this assumption into question.
Physicalism
Proponents of the disease model routinely cite the physical basis of addiction: sufficiently frequent and heavy
substance use may result in changes to the brain that
then drive drug seeking and consumption. A choice
model theorist can happily join them in a neuromaterialist understanding of addiction, even if voluntary
behavior plays an important role. Explanatory models of
addiction as the gradual development of a disordered
motivational architecture, within which choices continue to be made, are fully consistent with, and indeed
depend on, the neural determinants of choices themselves. Examples, which are likely consilient, include
incentive salience mediated by D2 dopamine receptors
[26], operant conditioning [27], glucose-regulated ego
depletion [28], the “neural tug of war” between impulse
and self-control [11], and hyperbolic discounting [29].
Such mechanisms, in concert with environmental and
contextual factors (e.g., domestic violence, lack of rewarding non-drug alternatives), can explain why drug
seeking and consumption sometimes come to predominate over other goals. The increased motivational salience of drug-related cues, and the powerfully reinforcing effects of drugs, end up driving the behavioral
agenda. But as noted above, the pursuit of this agenda
involves the rational capacity to choose among courses
of action in light of anticipated consequences, the hallmark of voluntary action.
Whatever neuroscientific model, or combination of
models, eventually gains the most evidential support,
we have good reason to suppose that the choices made
by those with addictive disorders, at each and every
stage of addiction, are entirely a function of neurallyinstantiated decision-making processes. These encode
subjectively experienced drive states (e.g., craving, pain,
anxiety), and represent the current situation, anticipated
contingencies, and the likely consequences of action. To
introduce, absent compelling evidence, a non-physical
factor into causal accounts of addictive behavior would
therefore conflict with what looks to be a very plausible
constraint on naturalistic explanations.

T. W. Clark

“Soul Control” – The Contra-Causal Assumption
Nevertheless, the widely held, substance-dualist folk
view of human agents – that we have immaterial souls
or mental essences as well as bodies [30–33] – works to
support just such an introduction, thus weakening the
commitment to a fully causal view of addiction. A
purportedly non-physical aspect or component of the
person has the capacity to select among options from
an uncaused vantage point, exerting what could colloquially be called “soul control” [34]. Whatever physical
processes might operate in the brain and body to produce behavior, there’s a categorically immaterial, undetermined controller that makes the final determination in
deciding how to act. Operating outside the ambit of
causal laws and relations, it has the capacity to have
chosen otherwise in an actual situation, even given all
the physically-instantiated factors in play – the unconditional capacity to do otherwise [25, 34].
As suggested above, there’s no observational evidence or behavior-theoretic rationale for a nonphysical contributor to decision-making, something that
influences the playing out of brain and bodily processes
involved in choices to consume substances, or refrain
from substance use. Of course, we are far from a complete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved
in choice-making, but from an empirical perspective,
knowledge gaps provide no justification for positing
anything immaterial that contravenes or overrides physical law, whether at the chemical or neurological level.
In particular, there’s no evidence that the conscious
experience of deliberation and choosing, sometimes
characterized as a categorically mental phenomenon,
functions as a non-physical, uncaused controller of the
neural processes it is associated with and the resulting
behavior [34, 35]. If we side with science, we shouldn’t
suppose a different choice, predictable or not, would
have arisen in a situation, given the actual causes and
circumstances in play (unless indeterminism plays a
role, to be discussed below).
Person-Level Determinants
Decisions and choices are made by – determined by –
human agents, so the notion of causal determinism is
hardly foreign to commonsense thinking about voluntary behavior. Choices only become intelligible by ascribing them to some interacting combination of motives, character, and situation – a confluence of

Determinism and Destigmatization: Mitigating Blame for Addiction

223

determinants located in, around, and constituted by the
individual. Although there is no science-based reason to
suppose anything categorically non-physical contributes
to making choices, this needn’t prevent the explanation
of a choice from including the psychological and intentional levels [36] – the motives and reasons for action
that the individual and others might cite. Indeed, such
levels are indispensable when seeking to account for
addictive behavior in which action is often goaldirected and governed by the conscious anticipation of
short-term rewards, with scant attention given to longerterm costs.
Although the motivational syndromes characteristic
of addiction are physically instantiated at the sub-personal, neural level, the considerations that come into
play when acting on their urging (where to find drugs,
whether to enter treatment), are often most usefully
described in terms of person-level feelings, desires,
beliefs, and deliberations. The point here is that psychological and intentional explanations for choices made by
those with addictions do not contravene or by-pass
causation, but simply invoke causation at the personal
and psychological, not sub-personal, level. Addicted
individuals make their choices for various reasons
which they can articulate if asked, for instance to avoid
opioid withdrawal or to satisfy cue-triggered cravings
for cocaine; such reasons count as causes of voluntary
action even though brain-based, neuro-behavioral explanations also apply [37, 38]. There is nothing, therefore, in citing person-level psychological and reasonsbased explanations of addictive behavior that is inconsistent with physicalism, or that lends support to the
contra-causal assumption, the idea that a person might
have done otherwise in an actual situation. Indeed, the
reasons in play help explain why she acted as she did,
and not otherwise.

and might have chosen otherwise, even though she did
not. Realists (as opposed to skeptics) about libertarian
conceptions of free will lean strongly on indeterminism
as an essential prerequisite for making choices for which
individuals can be held morally responsible, and thus
blamed for (conscious, intentional, uncoerced) wrongful
behavior [39–43]. The self that chooses, according to
libertarians about free will, originates the choice in some
crucial respect that owes nothing to determining factors,
not even its own characteristics. Such a self thus becomes a first cause, an ultimately responsible originator.
The difficulty here is that, if indeterminism plays a
pivotal role in originating a choice, it is hard to see how
this makes a choice more (and not less) attributable to
the chooser. Instead, it becomes a motivational mystery.
As noted above, for a choice to be an agent’s it has to
result from causes (determinants) having to do with her
settled physiology, psychology, and/or reasons. There
must be agential determinism: persons have to be more
or less stable clusters of persisting characteristics which
we then cite as the determinants of their actions; we
rightly don’t assign agenthood as a function of indeterminism. Indeed, the contra-causal assumption is precisely an assumption about determinative agency: it asserts
that addicted persons might have done otherwise in
actual situations in a way that they as agents are responsible for, in a way that’s up to them because they, not
chance, determined the choice.
Since indeterminism prevents there being a clear
causal connection between an agent’s character, motivations, and choices (or at least cannot add to such a
connection), it cannot make the agent more responsible
for a choice than if it resulted from completely deterministic processes involving her physiology, feelings,
beliefs, and desires. Were it to play much of a role in
behavior, indeterminism would leave us at an explanatory and practical loss when it comes to addiction, or
any disorder for that matter.2
Of course, we can’t always predict how an intervention aimed at inducing recovery from addiction will play
out, but this isn’t evidence for something within the
person unconstrained by causal regularities. For all practical purposes, therefore, we can be determinists in good

Indeterminism
Those seeking to defend the contra-causal assumption
might cite the possible existence of indeterminism in
nature to explain why a person could have done otherwise in an actual situation: if indeterminism holds at
some level of explanation, then the current causes –
physical, psychological, and reasons-based – may not
necessitate a single, unique choice or action. Therefore,
the thinking goes, were we to replay the actual situation,
all circumstances held constant, a different outcome

main text: it is difficult to establish indeterminism as endowing agents

conscience concerning addictive behavior: we should
pursue its causal explanations on the very plausible
assumption they exist, even if they are sometimes complex, multi-factorial, probabilistic, or currently beyond
our grasp. Human agency doesn’t outrun its physical
instantiation or its historical and situational context,
even if some indeterminism holds, and even if the causal
influences in play are not straightforwardly algorithmic
or mechanistic. A pragmatic determinism, crucially including the agential determinism of choice and control,
therefore recommends itself as both a useful and likely
true perspective on addictive behavior. However, concerns about the implications of such a view are not
uncommon and need to be addressed, the burden of
the next section.

Preserving Accountability
Some might worry that rejecting the contra-causal assumption in favor of causal determinism renders an
agent completely unaccountable: if those struggling
with addiction couldn’t have chosen otherwise – ever
– as their addiction developed, then it might be supposed they can’t be held responsible and all is excused.
As the French proverb would have it: “Tout
comprendre, c’est tout pardonner” (to understand all is
to forgive all). This saying gets at an important psychological response to accepting the ubiquity of causation
in behavior, what I call the mitigation response
(discussed below). But it overlooks the fact that, although they have causal histories that explain who they
are and what they do, agents themselves are causers that
first need controlling, not pardoning or forgiveness,
when their choices cause harm, as sometimes happens
in addiction.
Proximate Responsibility
There is an obvious practical necessity in holding agents
responsible for choices as a way of “guiding goodness”
[45] even if past choices were fully determined. Making
rewards and sanctions contingent on behavior recruits
an agent’s capacities of memory, anticipation, and deliberation, diminished though these might be in the case
of addiction. Being held responsible or accountable –
what we can think of as the “contingency management”
of behavior [46] in the broadest possible sense – is
therefore an important tool to help individuals behave

T. W. Clark

otherwise in future situations, e.g., to avoid cues that
trigger cravings, refuse a proffered drink or smoke, or
finally seek out treatment. So although we can’t, as the
moral model might suggest, hold the addicted individual
ultimately responsible for her character and choices,
which are traceable to circumstances she didn’t choose,
we can hold her proximately responsible, as the (fully
caused) person whose behavior we are trying to improve
by a policy of accountability.
Excuses
It is critical to see that causal determinism is neither a
universal excuse nor grounds for automatic forgiveness
for normative transgressions [12].3 To excuse is to withhold sanctions because they aren’t justifiable, but sanctions (and rewards, of course) can be justified as forwardlooking influences, a way to cause the addicted person to
make better choices. To forgive is for a victim’s desire to
condemn and retaliate against a harm-doer to dissipate,
and is usually contingent upon credible evidence of regret
and the determination to reform. The agent status of those
with addictions – that they are justifiably seen as reasonsresponsive and accountable to some behavior-guiding
extent – legitimizes the (natural) demands for apologies
and restitution coming from those they harm. All told,
addicted persons can justifiably be held (proximately)
responsible as a means of influencing their choices, and
they should not be seen as beyond redemption, even
though they couldn’t have chosen otherwise in past situations (indeterminism aside). The question then becomes:
when addressing addiction, what sorts of responsibility
practices and interventions are justifiable under a pragmatic determinism?

Determinism and Desert
Critics of the choice model, and sometimes proponents,
worry that attributions of responsibility for voluntary
behavior will be used to justify punitive treatment of
addicted persons, as sometimes happens under the moral
model [11, 48, 49]. After all, unless excusing conditions
hold, don’t basically sane individuals deserve punishment, social or otherwise, for actions that violate moral
and legal norms and that inflict harm? If so, those with
3
Stephen Morse calls the idea that causation is a universal excuse the
“fundamental psycho-legal error,” see Moore [47].

Determinism and Destigmatization: Mitigating Blame for Addiction

225

addictions, having some capacity for choice, are to some
extent culpable and thus might merit punitive responses
to such behavior, including stigmatization.
Under the contra-causal assumption, addicted individuals exercising “soul control” could have made choices
that led to their not becoming addicted, even given their
exact genetic and environmental circumstances, however
difficult those might have been [50, pp.1074-6]. But they
chose not to, which places blame squarely on them for
their predicament.4 True, conditions might have been
conducive to making a bad choice – e.g., a situation
involving peer pressure to try cocaine – but, having the
capacity to transcend causation, they could have resisted
and chosen otherwise in the exact situation the offer was
in fact accepted. By discounting or downplaying the
actual causal story behind character, motivation, and
choices, such a view of agency makes the person an
ultimate originator of action, thus ultimately responsible.
Applied to those with addictions, it suggests that they
might deeply deserve stigmatization – social punishment
– for having ended up addicted. This of course is the
moral model of addiction in full force, and research
suggests that belief in contra-causality can indeed influence judgments of blame and desert [51, 52].

seeing her as an ultimate originator. Anyone in her
situation, given more or less the same set of biological
and psychological characteristics, would have done
more or less the same, any indeterminism aside. And
indeterminism, I’ve argued, can’t increase control or
responsibility. Disbelief in contra-causal agency can
thus keep our natural reactivity in check, making room
for more productive attitudes and policies as we seek to
prevent and treat addiction. As Frank and Nagel [48] put
it, “…as we learn more about the nature of addiction and
its complex causal trajectory, we may mitigate the extent
to which we morally engage with the addict in the same
way we do with non-addicted persons.” It is difficult to
justify the claim that those with addiction deserve stigmatization and harsh treatment, such as withholding
treatment or harm reduction measures, for having had
the misfortune to be exposed to the bio-psycho-social
circumstances that produced their character and disorder. By undercutting the contra-causal assumption, a
deterministic understanding of addiction helps to prevent the choice model from regressing to the moral
model, in which blame and stigma are seen as legitimate
and perhaps essential responses. Moreover, it points to
what actually caused addiction in the first place and thus
what might work to prevent and overcome it.

The Mitigation Response

The Legitimate Role of Reactivity

Giving up the contra-causal assumption, as recommended here, means that the person can no longer be seen as
standing outside the causal flux of genetics, environment, character, beliefs, desires, and situation, and therefore as having willfully originated harmful choices from
some uncaused vantage point. Accepting that she indeed
could not have chosen or done otherwise in actual
situations, at least in a way that would make her more
responsible than were her decisions fully caused, can
trigger what we might call the mitigation response: it
helps to undercut the assignment of strong, ultimate
responsibility and the associated agent-focused blame.
Understanding the deterministic provenance of the person and her choices distributes causal responsibility for
behavior to all those non-agent factors that played a role
in her formation; such understanding can thus help
defuse punitive responses to behavior premised on

An important caveat is in order, however. It isn’t as if
our morally relevant reactions (e.g., anger, distrust, resentment) to addictive behavior will be completely deactivated by the mitigation response, nor should they.
After all, such reactions are the emotional points of our
moral compass. Rather, we can understand them as
natural responses to normative violations, but ones that
we need not, and indeed should not, indulge in full
measure in many, perhaps most instances, given the
harms that often result from such indulgence (exceptions of course are immediate threats to life and limb).
Anger and disgust remain valid indicators of encountering problematic behavior, but we should not suppose
that addicted individuals deserve what, on the contracausal assumption, we might have thought was their just
comeuppance: stigma and harsh treatment.
The same psychological dynamic can help addicted
individuals themselves. Should they come to accept that
they are not ultimately responsible for their character,
choices, and current situation, this can help defuse corrosive self-blame and recrimination. In many cases they

With the obvious exceptions of those whose addictions resulted from
medical practice such as opioid treatment for pain, see Kolodny et al.
[53]. Not even those under the sway of the contra-causal assumption
would hold such individuals responsible for their addiction.

226

can, and should, make moral judgments about their
choices, judgments which can help motivate efforts to
break free of addiction and make amends and restitution
to those they may have harmed. But seeing how one’s
behavior was indeed fully a function of internal and
external conditions prevents taking on the deep, irrevocable shame and self-blame premised on the contracausal assumption: that one could have done otherwise
in an actual situation, but culpably chose not to. This can
further reduce stigma by reinforcing the perception that
addiction can be overcome if the right conditions are in
place (whether in or outside treatment), and that those
with addictions, since they are not bereft of agency, can
eventually be reintegrated into communities of trust.

A Realistic Prescription?
Although the challenge to the contra-causal assumption
is logically and empirically well-grounded, and offers
many practical benefits, it runs counter to entrenched
conceptions of human agency, so may be difficult to
promote as a means to mitigate stigma. We are taught
early on not to “pass the buck,” to take “personal responsibility,” so causal explanations of character,
choices and behavior may be seen as threats to autonomy and accountability as these are often conceived: as
based in our supposed capacity to originate choices from
an undetermined vantage point. Without there being
some wiggle room in the causal chain such that we
can ultimately credit or blame agents for their actions,
how is anything really their doing and not just the dead
hand of the past playing itself out?
Agential Determinism and Efficacy
The answer is simply that the agent survives in our
causal analysis as the most proximate determinant of
behavior, without which behavior becomes unintelligible. Agents needn’t be ultimate originators, ultimately
self-made, or exceptions to causal regularities, to be
legitimate targets of accountability or to take responsibility, as Bruce Waller puts it [54], for their behavior;
indeed, our accountability practices wouldn’t work if
behavior were contra-causal to any significant degree. If
someone attempts to pass the moral buck by citing the
causes of their addiction, we point out that causation per
se is not an excuse [12, 47] and that they too are causes
of behavior that must be kept within morally acceptable

T. W. Clark

bounds. But, as I’ve suggested, if we give up the contracausal assumption, the accountability practices themselves will be better kept within those bounds (thus
excluding stigmatization as an acceptable practice) and
be more effective [55].
Another objection is that a deterministic view of ourselves, even if true, might engender passivity: if we aren’t
ultimate originators, then aren’t we just simply along for
the causal ride? Perhaps, as argued by Saul Smilansky
[56], we should (paternalistically) hide the truth of pragmatic determinism, given the possible demotivating effect of discovering we are not self-created first causes.
But we needn’t be first causes to be effective causers in
our own right. Efforts to change arise out of motivational
dynamics that we aren’t in a position to set aside: when
we’re sufficiently hungry, we’ll generally look for something to eat. The life- and welfare-threatening aspects of
addiction and the attractions of competing positive incentives are often enough, eventually, to spur behavior
change, including entering treatment; and treatment itself
is, or should be, predicated on the rationale that behavior
change results from exposure to changed circumstances,
not an uninfluenced personal will.
A science-based, fully naturalized, deterministic
choice model of addiction must accept that better
choices and better exercise of self-control are always a
function of sufficient incentives and conditions. If those
struggling with addiction believe that they should be
able to muster the will to do better independently of
circumstances, this sets them up for self-blame should
they fail to improve, and may promote incuriosity about
how treatment can help. On the other hand, knowing
that one’s behavior is indeed fully a function of conditions, internal and external, can motivate efforts to create
the conditions conducive to recovery, including use of
appropriate medications [57].
Naturalizing Choice
Yet another objection might run as follows: you can’t
reasonably continue to call your model of addiction a
“choice” model, since real choices require that we could
have chosen otherwise in an actual situation as it played
out (the unconditional ability to do otherwise). To insist,
as this objection does, on contra-causality as a necessary
feature of choice (as has biologist Jerry Coyne [58])
would require us to find another expression for the
actual causal processes involved when we decide between competing alternatives. This is unreasonable

Determinism and Destigmatization: Mitigating Blame for Addiction

since the contra-causal assumption lacks empirical justification and “making choices” is a perfectly good
description of deliberating and deciding between alternatives, even if pragmatic determinism holds.
The incoherence of the contra-causal assumption, and
thus the viability of pragmatic determinism, becomes
clear by posing this question: if those with addiction, at
any point in its development or current manifestation,
could have done otherwise, why didn’t they? If they have
some residual capacity to resist cravings, what explains
their continuing failures to exercise this capacity? These
reasonable requests for explanation put pressure on the
idea that there is something or someone outside of causal
relations that could have intervened in the choice process
as it actually transpired. Exercising one’s remaining capacity for impulse control is a fully caused bit of behavior. A craving would only have been resisted if sufficient
countervailing incentives had been present, and the failure to resist – to exert sufficient impulse control – is
explained by their absence. We can see that a so-called
“irresistible impulse” would not have been resisted no
matter what incentives had been present, but that a “resistible impulse” is resisted only if sufficient
countervailing factors are in play. Coming fully to grips
with the determinants of character, motivation, choice,
and action will help identify such factors, contributing to
the prevention and control of addiction.

Rethinking Blame in Addressing Addiction
What, practically speaking, might follow were we to
take a fully causal, deterministic view of addictive behavior? I can do no better than join Hanna Pickard [13]
in her recommendation to assign “responsibility without
blame” to those with substance use or other behavioral
disorders (as do Kennett et al., [50 p. 1079ff]). While
acknowledging the remaining capacity for choice, and
thus the residual responsibility we can fairly attribute to
those with addiction, she nevertheless asks clinicians
(and the rest of us) not to indulge in “affective blame,”
defined as “a set of hostile feelings typically accompanied by equally hostile thoughts and actions.” This is
enabled by shifting the focus from moral evaluation to
forward-looking responsibility:
In the clinic, the purpose of employing the concept
of responsibility is … not fundamentally a form of
backwards looking moral evaluation, whereby a

227

person is judged and potentially condemned for
their past behaviour. Rather, the purpose of
employing the concept of responsibility is fundamentally forwards-looking, serving to identify
where there exists capacity for change thanks to
the presence of choice and control, and, through
clinical practices of holding responsible and to
account, to motivate and encourage people to break
the cycle… The clinic thus offers a corrective to the
tendency to understand our concept of responsibility as linked with affective blame, by offering a
clear and established practice of attributing responsibility for problematic behaviour and holding to
account without affective blame, but instead with
positive regard, maintaining attitudes such as concern, respect, and compassion throughout. [13]
Pickard recommends assigning responsibility without
(affective) blame primarily because it promotes patient
autonomy in service to recovery, but it also finds support in the considerations, discussed above, that mitigate
the emotions driving stigma. By focusing on the supposed capacity of the agent to have done otherwise in
actual situations, the contra-causal assumption provides
fertile ground for reactive blame, while ignoring causal
explanations. Dropping this assumption allows an appreciation of the actual determinants of addictive behavior, thus keeping reactivity in check while motivating
the forward-looking concept of responsibility.
Questioning “Basic Desert”
As Pickard recognizes, therapeutic approaches may
sometimes involve interventions that are unavoidably
felt as punitive (e.g., withholding privileges in response
to positive drug screens), but under her model these are
justified not in terms of deserved punishment but what
works best in behavior change. This rationale holds
even if we accept that there are sometimes morally
problematic dimensions of addictive behavior that must
be addressed [59]. We need not revert to the moral
model of addiction and its emphasis on blame and
punishment to keep our moral compass intact. Should
we decide some sort of emotion-laden response is in
order (“You should not have done that!”), we recognize
it as instrumental and forward-looking, not invoking
judgments based in the contra-causal assumption.
Others have recommended rethinking our conception
of blame in light of a causal understanding of behavior.

228

Gregg Caruso [60] and Derk Pereboom [61] argue that
individuals are not morally responsible in the “basic
desert” sense required to justify retributive attitudes
and responses, those which need not appeal to any
ameliorative consequence of placing blame. Pereboom
suggests that blame compatible with determinism
should be restricted to forward-looking functions, including self-protection from and reconciliation with the
wrong-doer and fostering their moral improvement.
Likewise, Erin Kelly [62] questions the retributive,
backwards-looking component of blame without denying its social and moral functions.5
Pointing out the causal antecedents of choices as a
means to mitigate reactive responses to moral harms is, of
course, nothing new (e.g., the French proverb quoted
above), and many have sided with Pickard in
recommending a more compassionate, less blamefocused approach to addictive disorders, among them
Burgess [15], Levy [28], Wakefield [59], and Flanagan
[67]. With blame and recrimination de-emphasized, those
suffering from addiction and other behavioral disorders
are more likely to seek out treatment, find supportive
programs, and thus stay the course in recovery. Understanding the actual causal etiology of the choices involved in addictive behavior is essential for the design
of effective interventions, so taking a pragmatically determinist view of addiction seems clinically warranted.

Resistance to Challenging Contra-Causality
Still, it is an open question whether the challenge to the
contra-causal assumption can be successfully recruited in
support of a compassionate choice model of addiction,
one that preserves (limited) agency but that helps mitigate
blame and stigma. This assumption may be too deeply
rooted in our folk, pre-scientific model of human agency
to be dislodged by pointing out that addiction, and human
behavior more generally, are fully caused phenomena.
5

I should note that compatibilists about free will and moral responsibility (see note 1), sometimes argue that under determinism we can still
justify retributive, backwards-looking desert, blame and punishment,
for instance as based in our natural reactive attitudes (see, for example,
Hirstein, Sifferd, and Fagan [63, pp. 210–214]) or as a means of
upholding a particular conception of human dignity (as does Stephen
Morse [64, p. 443]). They hold that a merely conditional sense of could
have done otherwise (note 1) is sufficient for assigning robust, affective
blame, and, contrary to the position taken here, they may dismiss what I
call the mitigation response as a “moral hallucination,” as does Michael
Moore [65, p. 132]). An adjudication of this disagreement is beyond
the scope of this paper, but see Clark [66].

T. W. Clark

Moreover, our natural penchant for placing affective,
punitive blame finds a convenient target in the purportedly ultimately responsible self that could have done
otherwise in an actual situation, but chose not to; such a
propensity could motivate resistance to deterministic understandings of behavioral disorders. Nevertheless,
reconceptualizing human agency in light of science –
naturalizing ourselves as fully caused agents who nevertheless deliberate, decide and act within a moral framework – may reinforce the judgment that the stigma attached to addiction is, in the main, neither deserved nor
efficacious. Making the public case for pragmatic determinism will present its own set of challenges, but is worth
pursuing as we seek more compassionate and effective
approaches to prevent and treat behavioral disorders.

Abstract: Recently, the industrial wireless sensor network (WSN) has gained attention as a
complement to wired networks due to its flexibility and lower installation cost. We present a
novel Reverse Packet Elimination (RPE) algorithm implementation at the IPv6 over the TSCH mode
of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH) stack that increases reliability without significantly increasing energy
consumption. RPE increases the reliability while conserving energy by transmitting a cancellation
packet from the sink towards the sender to reduce unnecessary packets. The evaluation utilized
mainly the 6TiSCH Simulator, with additional analytical assessments. We present several evaluation
scenarios and compare WSN with and without RPE. In a WSN where each link had a packet reception
rate of 70%, RPE increased the reliability with 11.8%. Furthermore, the average latency decreased
with 39.1%. The average energy consumption increased with 19.8% when utilizing RPE. However,
the network lifetime, i.e., the time before the first node experiences battery depletion increases slightly,
which is a significant improvement compared to alternative replication mechanisms.

1. Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging with an expectation of billions of connected devices to the
Internet. These devices utilize low-power wireless communication technologies enabling long battery
life and reliable end-to-end transmissions [1]. Capitalizing on this development, industries shift
towards the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) through concepts such as Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSN). Utilizing WSN decreases installation cost as compared to infrastructures for wired sensor
networks [2]. According to [3], the cost of installing cables across an industrial plant can run from USD
100s/ft to USD 1000s/ft.
In 2016 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 low-rate wireless
standard [4] was amended with a new Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) media access control
targeting industrial applications. The IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH) working
group [5] was started by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with an intent to enable IP traffic for
IIoT utilizing TSCH. In addition, 6TiSCH follows IETF Deterministic Network (DetNet) working
group architecture [6], aiming to standardize layer three traffic in terms of networks requiring
deterministic capabilities. Wireless networks have a higher probability of packet loss compared
to wired due to interference and channel disturbance. Hence, 6TiSCH recommends packet replication
in its architecture in order to increase the reliability [5]. However, in WSN packet replication causes
higher energy consumption [7] and, thus, reduced network lifetime. Industrial networks face tough
lifetime requirements that WSN struggles to meet with packet replication.

This paper proposes and investigates a novel technique utilizing a Reverse Packet Elimination
(RPE) algorithm. Packet replication is used to increase the reliability of the network. In addition,
RPE limits the negative effect of reduced network lifetime as the replicated packets are cancelled when
the original packet successfully reached its destination. This is achieved as the RPE enables the sink
to send a packet down the alternative path to eliminate the replicated packet from being transmitted
upstream. The energy consumption is reduced as a RPE packet is smaller than an upstream packet,
and hence utilizing less resources to traverse the path. In addition, this paper examines the effects of
introducing an adjustable replication delay, where the transmission of the replicated packet is delayed.
The motivation for this is to avoid transmitting the replication packet if the original packet has arrived
at its destination (the sink).
2. Background
Assume a scenario where an Industrial WSN (IWSN) establishes communication in a feedback
loop that compensates for a control variable in a system. The system defines the update time that the
control loop must fulfill in order to keep the system stable. Hence, a WSN must ensure that the control
variable is delivered within a minimum latency according to these requirements.
Replicating packets is a technique to ensure higher reliability. This means that each packet is
duplicated and sent along two disjoint paths. At the destination, only the first packet is kept, and the
copied packets are discarded as they arrive. Packet replication creates redundant data traffic, in order
to avoid a single point of failure. In short, this increases reliability with the drawback of increased
traffic and energy consumption as more packets traverse the network.
2.1. DetNet
DetNet working group [8], intend to provide an architecture for networks requiring guaranteed
bandwidth, extremely low loss, and an upper bound on maximum end-to-end latency at layer 3
paths across multiple layer 2 networks. The DetNet working group collaborates with the IEEE
802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking task group [9] which is improving on layer 2 operations to ensure
deterministic capabilities. In essence, DetNet and TSN define a common architecture for both Layer 2
and Layer 3 to ensure applications requiring determinism can work across both layers.
2.2. TSCH
Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) media access divides time into timeslots and assigns
them in order to avoid contention. In addition, channel hopping combats link failures caused by
external interference and multi-path fading. Together, this enables TSCH to achieve high reliability.
Furthermore, TSCH opens for low-power operation as a device may sleep if the schedule of slots does
not indicate otherwise. The length of a timeslot is typically 10 ms and timeslots are grouped into
repeating slotframes commonly consisting of 101 timeslots [10]. A single element in the TSCH schedule
is known as a cell. A cell in the slotframe is identified by a timeslot- and channel-offset [11]. It allows
for one transmission opportunity with an optional acknowledgment. The allocation of cells in the
slotframe is typically referred to as the schedule. Figure 1 shows a slotframe which is three timeslots
long where four cells have been scheduled. Cells can be organized in what the 6TiSCH architecture
denote as tracks [5] (which can also be part of a DetNet flow). These are in principle reserved resources
between two entities, e.g., a node and a sink. In essence, cells are reserved for a specific track, and
only traffic associated with this track may utilize the cells. Multiple cells bundled together increase
the probability of successful transmission within a slotframe. Tracks are shaped as a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG), and support multi-path forwarding and route around failures [5]. An illustration of a
track is provided in Figure 1.

2.3. 6TiSCH
6TiSCH working group [5] combines standards developed from both IETF and IEEE,
i.e., the industry-enabling TSCH MAC, with an Internet-enabling IPv6-based upper layer. This include
amongst other the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [12] and UDP.
Altogether this constitutes the 6TiSCH stack which aims for end-to-end connectivity with deterministic
capabilities, low power operation and robustness [3]. It is envisioned to enable the Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT), and includes applications such as industrial process monitoring and control.
A comprehensive description and tutorial on 6TiSCH can be found in [13].
2.4. RAW
The recently formed Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) working group [14] at IETF extends
the work at DetNet into new use-cases for wireless applications in aeronautics, robotics, industry,
gaming, etc. While DetNet mainly focus on wired connections, RAW addresses wireless-specific
topics for a move towards deterministic properties over technologies such as 5G and 6TiSCH. RAW is
applied at the forwarding-plane at layer 3, i.e., the end-to-end routing decision is still taken at the
controller-plane by, e.g., a centralized DetNet Path Computation Element (PCE). Yet the per-packet
forwarding decision is handled by RAW with an aim to ensure the end-to-end path has high reliability
and availability., e.g., if an intermediary node fails or a link is degraded, RAW offer mechanisms
such as packet retransmission, replication, elimination, and overhearing (PAREO) to mitigate the
failure [15].
3. Related Work
Our work relates to the effort of increasing the robustness of WSN conducted by The Leapfrog
Collaboration (LFC) [16,17]. This work was recently extended in [18] which proposes PAREO where
packet retransmission, replication, and overhearing is evaluated in combination. However, to the
best of our knowledge, no related work exists in terms of a reverse mechanism or replication delay.
Although, in [19] the authors visit the idea of a reverse packet mechanism in Ethernet, with the
reversing of packet elimination to free bandwidth upstream. However, the proposal is not further
discussed or investigated.
Packet replication and elimination techniques in WSN increases energy consumption significantly.
Such a rise in energy consumption is expected as the number of packets traversing the network at
minimum doubles. This is shown in [7], where the authors implement disjoint paths and transmit a
replicated packet at each path. In short, the source duplicates the packet and the sink drops the last
arriving packet. The authors show that packet replication decreased packets lost with almost 90%,
however, the energy consumption in their scenario increased with 86.3%.
Leapfrog Collaboration (LFC) utilizes the same principle as [7] by dropping the last arriving
packet. However, LFC implements replication and dropping at each hop. By taking advantage of
promiscuous overhearing, LFC utilizes a Leapfrog Beacon which enables all nodes to make the same
cell available for receiving (RX). Opening the same cell allows all nodes except the node transmitting
to listen for data, and LFC uses the overhearing function to double the probability that the packet will
traverse over the DODAG network. As a result, delay decreases significantly as the packet propagates
the favorable path. If no nodes are within sensing range, normal retransmission schemes are used.

LFC achieves minimum end-to-end reliability of 99.1% for all simulations, with the lowest packet
delivery ratio (PDR) link quality at 70% [17]. However, with a drawback as the energy consumption
increases. LFC reduces the average delay by 41% compared to schemes with four retransmission
attempts [17].
4. Reverse Packet Elimination
This paper proposes a novel Reverse Packet Elimination (RPE) algorithm that aims at increasing
reliability while limiting the negative effect of reduced network lifetime. Similar to [7] two disjoint
paths are created from the source to the sink. The motivation for using packet replication is to
increase the reliability of the WSN. It is assumed, as in [7], that the scheduler establishes the paths or
tracks based on routing and connectivity information obtained through the control plane links [20].
The disjoint paths or tracks may be computed by a centralized PCE running, e.g., the Traffic Aware
Scheduling Algorithm (TASA) as proposed by [21]. The source node replicates its data packet, that is
one candidate packet for each path. However, the node transmits initially only one of the packets and
detains the second. The following description discusses the motivation and criterion for delaying the
second packets. Forwarding two packets increases the traffic load and thus the energy usage in the
network. Furthermore, as the packets have the same size, they have the same drop probability over
lossy links (links with high Bit Error Rate (BER)). In addition, adding traffic increases the funneling
effect. The first packet that arrives at the sink, triggers the sink to send a small RPE-cancelling packet
down the alternative path from the path of the packet.
The RPE-cancelling packet searches for the copy that is propagating upstream and cancels it, i.e.,
stop further forwarding of the packet in order to conserve energy. The basic structure of the RPE
algorithm is packet replication and enabling the sink to cancel the second packet. However, a second
feature is introduced, this is a delay of transmitting the second packet. Depending on the requirements
for delay and robustness, the second copy can be withheld by an adjustable time delay τ. This is
depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Illustration of how the replicated is withheld by τ.

An example network illustrating RPE is shown at the right hand side of Figure 3. The source node
is node number 7 and the sink is node number 0. From the source to the sink two disjoint paths are
shown, as Path A and Path B. The source node holds initially two copies of the packet (the original
and the replicated packet). Our proposed RPE method is described in six steps:

1. A PCE schedules 6TiSCH tracks in daisy chains with two disjoint paths, Path A and Path B.
Path A is by design scheduled to send the first packet. As shown in Figure 3, blue cells make up a track
from source to sink (0).
2. The source node replicates the data packet and sends it along Path A. Next, the sender schedules
the copied packet to be transmitted along path B, which is disjoint from A. Both paths have explicit
routes towards the sink as seen in Figure 4a. The copied packet along Path B is delayed dependent on
the upper bound latency of the application. The motivation for delaying this packet will be discussed
further in the following text.

3. The two packets propagate along the two disjoint paths towards the sink. As depicted in
Figure 4b, the packet arriving last is discarded if both packets arrive at the sink before the sink could
send an RPE-cancelling packet.
4. If they do not arrive simultaneously, the sink sends an RPE-cancelling packet down the
alternative path from path of the arriving packet as shown in Figure 5a. For example, if the Path A
packet arrives first, the RPE-cancelling packet is sent down Path B and vice versa.
5. The RPE-cancelling packet traverses towards the source. In each visiting node, the packet
triggers a search in the node’s queues for a copy of the packet that arrived at the sink. As illustrated in
Figure 5b. If a packet is located with an identical sequence number, this packet is dropped.

6. If an RPE-cancelling packet arrives at the source (looping back) before the replicated packet is
sent, the source revokes the transmission of the copied packet.
4.1. Packet Size
In our investigations, we utilize a max packet size of 127 bytes for data packets and the
RPE-cancelling packets are set to 23 bytes. 23 bytes is the minimum packet size of an 802.15.4 frame
carrying the necessary headers and two bytes containing the RPE-cancelling payload.

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

Link quality is defined by its BER and the BER differs for each link according to its propagation
characteristics. Assuming the BER of each bit is independent, if there is a bit error in a packet, the packet
is dropped. PER in Equation (1) denotes the packet error rate for a packet with n bits.
PER = 1 − (1 − Pb )nbits

(1)

Writing packet reception rate (PRR) as PRR = 1 − PER, the following relation is found between the
PRR of two packets with different sizes (short and long packets, namely PRRs and PRRl ), with both
packets experience the same BER.
Ls
L

PRRs = 1 − PRRl l

(2)

where Ls and Ll are the numbers of bits in the short packet and long packet respectively. Equation (2)
shows that the packet size matters in terms of PRR. Since the cancelling packet is significantly smaller
than the larger upstream packet it has some advantages; it has higher PRR. Furthermore, the smaller
RPE-cancelling packets require less transmission time as they contain fewer bits than a large data
packet. This causes reduced energy consumption. Finally, due to higher PRR, the time the radio is
active is lower, energy consumption decreases due to fewer retransmission attempts. From Equation (2)
we find that if a 127 bytes data packet experiences a PRR = 70%, then a 23 bytes RPE-cancelling packet
experiences a PRR = 93.7% under the same BER condition.
To put this into perspective, assume the topology in Figure 4 where the source sends replicated
packets along Path A and Path B. After a while, the link quality between 1 and 3 deteriorates from
70% to 20% for the 127 bytes packet. Assume that a 127 bytes packet then has a PRR = 20%,
a 23 bytes RPE-cancelling packet have PRR = 74.7% at the same link. This means that theoretically,
a RPE-cancelling packet can traverse from 1 to 3 and stop the large packet from utilizing all its
retransmission attempts. In essence, this decreases resource utilization at nodes when a change in
link quality occurs. As mentioned earlier, smaller packets consume less energy than larger packets.
The main contributor to energy consumption in WSN is transmitting and receiving packets [22].
Based on this understanding the energy consumption of transmitting and receiving a packet is
proportional to the packet size. Thus, transmitting short RPE-cancelling packets requires less energy
than longer data packets.
4.2. Selecting Delays
This section discusses delaying the replicated data packet. Clearly, this depends on the
requirements imposed on the network by the system. For example, a WSN in a control loop must
supply the controller with data within a time frame in order to keep the process stable. Assume the
maximum permitted delay imposed on the network is Tcrit , where we have reduced the number to
safeguard the system. The maximum delay Tcrit is a design criterion for the delay between the source
and the sink, Tonepath . If the delay from source to sink meets the design criteria (Tcrit ), but with limited
margin, the advantage of RPE is as described above. However, if there is a margin, for example,
that the delay between source and sink permits that the replicated packet is delayed a time, τ, before it
is transmitted then the second advantage of RPE comes to play. RPE provides energy savings and
preserves the robustness when the replicated packet can be delayed a time τ before it is transmitted.
This means that if the first packet is lost, the replicated packet meets the deadline as it reaches the
sink. In order to reduce the traffic, RPE enables the sink to cancel unnecessary transmission of the
replication packets by sending RPE-cancelling packets. As pointed out earlier, this reduces the energy
consumption in the WSN. In addition, it reduces the funneling effect caused by added data traffic
imposed on the nodes close to the sink (the topic is presented in the following text). Next, we discuss
the time delay, τ.
Selected replication delays τ are as follows: 1, 8, 816, 1624. As mentioned earlier τ is always
given in slots, and it is the delay from the time the first copy was sent. Our assessment of delaying

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

7 of 17

the replication packet is based on three scenarios. Firstly, we assess the situation where both packets
are transmitted without waiting for the cancelling packet. Secondly, we assess the situation where the
delay is larger than the round-trip time from the source to the sink. This means that the replication
packet is delayed so much that the first packet reaches the sink and the cancelling packet reaches back
to the source. In our example, this equals eight slots. However, if the first packet experiences delay
caused by retransmission, the second packet is transmitted. Delaying the replication packet further
takes retransmission into account. Thirdly, we assess the situation where the replication packet is
delayed to the extent that both the path A packet and the RPE-cancelling packet have exhausted all
their retransmission attempts.
When τ = 1 slot, the source always sends two copies. This delay has the lowest latency (for both
packets) since both packets have the shortest scheduled delay. Moreover, both packets traverse Path
A and Path B towards the sink with a time difference of a slot as illustrated in Figure 6. As can be
seen in the figure, the RPE-cancelling packet, from the sink towards the source, must wait for one slot.
The reason is that according to the scheduler, the sink must first listen for incoming packets in the
2 → 0-cell (Path B). If the replicated packet did not arrive, the next cell, marked as 0 → 2, is allocated
to the RPE-cancelling packet. Clearly, switching these two cells is an option, saving one transmission
from node 2, at the expense of increasing the delay along path B by one slot.

Figure 6. Scheduling a delay of τ = 1.

The next delay is τ = 8, Figure 7 depicts the scheduler. τ = 8 slots are selected based on the number
of hops between source and sink, since there are 4 hops to sink and 4 hops in return to the source.
As can be seen, the Path B packet will not be sent if the Path A packet arrives successfully according
to the scheduler, and the reverse path back to the source do likewise. When τ = 8 slots, the Path A
packet has enough time to reach the sink and trigger a message to stop the source from transmitting
the replicated packet.

Figure 7. Scheduling a delay of τ = 8.

If τ > 101, the replicated packet is scheduled with a delay of at least one slotframe later. A delay
of τ = 1624 slots is the maximum latency of the packet looping back to the source in this topology.
The delay equals 16 slotframes. In essence, the Path A packet is given the time to utilize all transmission
attempts before the Path B packet is transmitted. A transmission fails if a packet was lost or its

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

8 of 17

acknowledgement (ACK) fails during transmission. Hence, nodes have several attempts to ensure
successful transmission. However, if a transmission fails in the current configuration, a node has
to wait until the next slotframe iteration before trying again. Finally, τ = 824 slots was selected to
investigate the difference between the short and the long delays. With τ = 824 slots, the delay is cut
from 16 slotframes to eight slotframes. The delays are topology specific except τ = 1 slot.
4.3. Path Considerations
RPE assumes a routing protocol capable of providing upward routes for data and replicated data,
as well as downward routes for RPE-cancelling packets. The RPL routing protocol which is part of
the 6TiSCH suite offers both these capabilities. Since the downward RPE-cancelling packet always
originates at the sink node, both storing and non-storing RPL mode may be utilized with RPE.
The RPL preferred parent selection needs to be adapted such that the source node can employ
both Path A and Path B to forward traffic. Such a mechanism is implemented in [18]. Selection of
different parents, namely Preferred Parent and Alternative Parent, is in itself a field to be studied,
and is not treated further here. An example of work in this direction can be found [23].
RPE requires routing and accompanying schedules to yield disjoint paths through the network.
Investigation into this assumption, such as, e.g., the requirement on network density, is deferred to
future work. As described above, for our evaluation we assume a centralized PCE as envisioned in, e.g.,
6TiSCH to provide this capability. This centralized strategy seems to be an intuitive solution for these
cases since it has an end-to-end awareness such that disjoint paths can be guaranteed. The 6TiSCH
hop-by-hop scheduling model [5] may also be feasible since it has the same end-to-end property.
5. Simulation Setup
This section investigates our proposed Reverse Packet Elimination method. It was implemented
in the 6TiSCH simulator [24]. The network topology selected was influenced by Leapfrog
Collaboration [16,17], and the configuration contains 8 nodes. As seen in Figure 4, node 0 is the
sink and node 7 is the source. The network is configured to utilize the full implementation of 6TiSCH
available in the simulator. The parameters utilized in the simulation are listed in Table 1.

5.1. Scenarios
Several different configurations were simulated to assess the effects of the Reverse Packet
Elimination technique. These configurations are listed here:

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

9 of 17

5.1.1. Single Path
Is a scenario where traffic is only sent from the source to sink through Path A. At Path B, no data
traffic occurs, only normal 6TiSCH generated traffic traverses along the path. This scenario defines
normal 6TiSCH operation without packet replication or packet elimination. In the following text and
in the figures, the Single Path scenario is referred to as SP.
5.1.2. Dual Path
Dual Path scenario depends on the existence of two disjoint paths between the source and the
sink, which means that the two paths do not share any relaying nodes. One path is utilized by the
original packet, while a replicated packet is sent up the second path. In addition, there is no RPE-packet
generated at the sink. Dual Path is a simple implementation of the Packet Replication, Elimination,
and Ordering Functions (PREOF) as described in DetNet Architecture [6]. The following text refers to
this scenario as DP.
5.1.3. RPE
RPE refers to the implementation of our novel Reverse Packet Elimination proposal. This scenario
is listed with corresponding sending delay, τ, in the text and the figures. The delay is given in number
of TSCH slots. In all RPE scenarios, the traffic is sent at Path A with the replicated copies being sent at
Path B (if required).
5.1.4. RPE Overprovisioning
In this scenario the PCE schedules an extra transmitting (TX) and RX slot for each upstream
hop. Otherwise, this refers to RPE operation with τ = 8 slots. In the figures, RPE Overprovisioning is
referred to as OP.
6. Performance Results
Our hypothesis is that RPE increases the WSN’s reliability without substantial decreased network
lifetime. Presumably, RPE can only support system where its critical time delay compared to the WSN
round trip time (from source to sink) meets the requirements presented here. This section assesses the
performance of RPE in light of these challenges. As seen in Figure 8, nodes are named according to
their path and hop count, such as A2 or B1.

Figure 8. Nodes with corresponding path and hop count.

6.1. Reliability
The RPE method is investigated for a WSN with links that experience packet drops. Following
the same investigations as LFC [16], we assess links with PRR 70% increasing in increments of 10%
until a 100% PRR. RPE, with τ = 8 slots, is compared with the Single Path scenario. It was found that
all the scenarios involving packet replication showed a negligible difference in reliability as from the
sinks point of view the delay τ does not affect the PRR. Hence, in Figure 9 SP is only compared to RPE
τ = 8 for simplicity.

Figure 9 shows that RPE increases reliability compared to Single Path. Single Path was found to
have a reliability of 88.24% when the link quality was 70%. At the same link quality, RPE increases
the reliability to 98.65%. Moreover, the reliability of WSN with links with link quality of 80% shows
significant improvements as Single Path had a packet reception ratio of 97.7% compared to RPE with
a success rate of 99.95%. Lastly, at 90% link quality, the gap in reliability shrinks to a difference of
0.09% as RPE delivers a 100.0% delivery ratio. However, there is packet loss involved, and over time
statistically, a packet will be dropped.
6.2. Distribution of RPE-Cancelling Packets

Packets stopped %

Clearly, our RPE method creates additional traffic in the network compared to a single path.
In order to investigate the negative effects of increased traffic, we investigated where the packets are
eliminated. Figures 10 and 11 presents the findings. They show where, along the paths, the RPE
packets are eliminated. Figure 10 shows how different PRR values change the elimination location.
The reduced link quality causes the elimination to spread across all nodes.

along Path B, but over 30 runs the average value recorded was less than 0.1%. Although, at node B3 an
average of 4 packets were eliminated accounting for 0.24% of the drops. Summarizing, τ = 816 and
τ = 1624 shows 99.76% and 100% packet elimination occur at the sink. Delay effects are discussed in
more detail in the following text.

This section presents the simulation results with regards to latency in data sent from the source
to the sink. To provide a baseline, Table 2 shows how the maximum latency increase with longer
replication delays and minimum theoretical increase when overprovisioning.

The latencies of the 99th percentile are presented in Table 4. Single Path has a higher 99th
percentile for all link qualities compared to RPE with τ = 1 and τ = 8. At PRR = 90% the difference is
1.89 s between RPE with τ = 1 and Single Path. Increasing τ from one slot to eight slots increases 99th
percentile latency with 40 ms. This is interesting as the difference in sending the replicated packet is
increased from 10 ms to eight times as high at 80 ms, but 99th percentile latency is only increased with
40 ms. Decreasing the link quality increases the 99th percentile latencies for all scenarios. What is more,
the difference between τ = 1 and τ = 8 is fairly similar for each value of PRR (70%, 80%, and 90%).

6.4. Node Lifetime

Lifetime in years

The network lifetime is an important parameter; it has, however, several definitions [25]. Here we
adopt the definition that the network lifetime equals the time until the energy of the first node depletes.
In our simulations, we have utilized a battery size of 2821.5 mAh.
Figure 12 presents the average node lifetimes in years for all simulations. Due to the extra TX/RX
cell when Overprovisioning (OP), Path A has a significantly lower battery lifetime compared to Path
B. Comparing Path A of OP with alternative RPE shows that OP has the lowest lifetime. It shows
an imbalance as Path A is over-utilized and Path B not utilized. Dual Path (DP) also has worse
performance at each node, compared to all simulations using RPE.

Lifetime in days

All simulations show a correlation between lifetime and where the upstream copy was eliminated.
τ = 816, τ = 1624 and OP has the highest number of packets eliminated at the source. Hence, the source
has the highest lifetime, as it does not send the replicated packet as often as for the other scenarios.
It is very interesting to note the decreased load on node A1 when τ = 1. This is due to the frequency
of alternating drops at sink, A1 and B1. On the other hand, it causes the source to have the lowest
battery life of all RPE scenarios. The reason for the lowest battery life at the source is as mentioned in
the selection of delays, that the source always sends both copies.
We found that for all simulations the first node to run out of power is A1, except in τ = 1 and
1
τ = 8 were in approximately 30
simulations B1 had the shortest lifetime. Figure 13 presents the lowest
node lifetimes. As seen previously in Figure 11, no elimination was registered when using τ = 816
or τ = 1624, causing traffic to behave as DP and SP. This is reflected in the lowest lifetime as for both
scenarios it is within 7 days of SP and DP. The effects of OP are clear with A1 running out of battery
338 days before any other version due to the over-utilization at Path A. As mentioned in Section 4.1,
packet size matters, and the effects of utilizing RPE is clear on the node lifetimes.

6.5. Funneling Effect

Lifetime in days

The funneling effect occurs as the nodes closer to the sink have a higher load than nodes further
away, due to the concentration of traffic on fewer nodes. This is shown in Figure 14 where the average
lifetime at A1 and B1 for all versions using packet replication are listed. The short delay, τ = 1, return the
evenest distribution between A1 and B1 since packet elimination occurs at a higher frequency at these
nodes as seen in Figure 14. In addition, τ = 8 decreases the funneling effect as well, but not as much
as τ = 1. On the other hand, increasing replication delay τ decreases the load on Path B. Moreover,
overprovisioning has the lowest latency, resulting in the highest load on Path A, and lowest load on
Path B. As previously mentioned, this is due to the over-utilization on Path A. The funneling effect can
be seen for all nodes in Figure 14 where lifetime increases with distance from the sink.

6.6. Average Energy Consumption
Energy consumption is critical in industrial WSN. As stated in the introduction, our hypothesis is
that RPE reduces energy consumption. The energy consumption is found from the current consumption,
since the voltage is constant. Different WSN designs produce different average current consumption
as topology influences energy consumption. The average accumulated current consumption is shown
in Figure 15. The effects of packet replication are clear, as shown in Figure 15, Single Path utilizes
159 mAh less than second-place τ = 1624. This illustrates the energy cost of replication in general.
The effects of overprovisioning are seen with the highest accumulated current consumption
at 1225 mAh. This increase is due to the extra cells, which causes more idle listening than the
other scenarios.
Another key point is that the RPE scenarios have a lower average current consumption compared
to Dual Path. A decrease in average current consumption is important as this topology does not
represent a complete network. In fact, real network data traverse from other paths as well. Hence,
decreased current consumption decreases due to reduced load on certain nodes due to funneling effects.

7. Discussions
Our analysis follows the methods used by LFC, and as LFC we investigate only a section of a
WSN. A complete WSN with several paths puts requirements on the network design as two paths must
be available for critical traffic flows. Our RPE method imposes only the requirement that the two paths
are disjoint. Paths may hold a different number of nodes; this difference will alter the performance

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

14 of 17

in terms of finding the optimal delay of the replication packet. Clearly, the method depends on the
requirements imposed on the WSN in terms of delay tolerances and the performance of the WSN.
Our results show optimal delay equals the time delay from the source to the sink and back along the
second path. In our network, this was a delay of eight slots. The reason is that in an environment with
no packet losses, the tracks allow a packet to loopback and stop the source from sending the replicated
packet. Based on the results with 80% link quality, τ = 8 achieves the best traits of all replication
delays. Comparing our RPE with scenarios Dual Path and Single Path with PRR = 80%, the lowest
node lifetime increased with 1.74%. Next, the average latency is reduced with 39.1% and reliability
increases from 97.7% to 99.95%, when comparing our RPE with Single Path. A natural disadvantage
with the RPE proposal is the increase in average current consumption compared to using a Single
Path. This is due to extra tracks and packets traversing disjoint paths. However, packet replication is
recommended by DetNet architecture and RPE decreases the average current consumption compared
to Dual Path, increases with 18% compared to Single Path. Finally, if low average latency is critical,
it is recommended to utilize Overprovisioning. Overprovisioning has a 71.2% lower average latency
than τ = 8. However, this comes with an 18.34% reduction in the lowest node lifetime.
8. Conclusions
A novel method, Reverse Packet Elimination (RPE), for packet replication is proposed and
analyzed in 6TiSCH. RPE delays the replicated packet from being transmitted and implements a
method for cancelling the transmission of the replication packet if the original packet reached its
destination. RPE enables WSN with higher reliability, lower average latency and increased node
lifetime compared to traditional WSN. Clearly, as with any packet replication method the traffic
increases and thus the average energy consumption in the network increases. However, the method of
cancelling the replication packet proves effective as it reduces unnecessary transmissions. Related work
Leapfrog Collaboration (LFC) finds a 99.1% worst case reliability, with the disadvantage of increasing
energy consumption. Our method has similar reliability as LFC, as we got worst-case reliability of
97.7%. Another key point, RPE decreases the funneling effect, thus reducing the energy consumption
of nodes closer to the sink and increasing the WSN lifetime. In fact, the lowest node lifetime increased
by 1.74% compared to not utilizing any packet replication. However, a drawback of RPE versus LFC
is a slight increase in average latency due to the delayed replication packet. This implies that RPE is
not optimized for WSN with the most extreme latency requirements. LFC reports a 41% reduction in
average latency compared to standard retransmission schemes, while we found that RPE has a 39.1%
reduction with equal retransmission attempts. Moreover, LFC is by design dependent on high node
density. RPE requires only two disjoint paths to the sink. This makes RPE less dependable on topology
and presumably suitable for other WSNs.
9. Future Work
The proposed RPE method uses dedicated RPE-cancelling packets for signaling the successful
arrival of the packet. Alternative signaling to reduce overhead may be explored such as piggybacking
the cancelling-information on other traffic. Clearly, the solution depends on the latency requirements
and whether there is any communication from the receiver to the source. Furthermore, the efficiency
of cancellations may be improved since the current solution mandates one signal per replicated packet.
Lastly, as proposed in RAW [15], the necessity to utilize a mechanism such as RPE could be evaluated
continuously by the forwarding plane.
Identifying and selecting paths to use with RPE clearly has impact on its performance. This subject
was outside of our current scope yet requires investigation before a full implementation can be made.
It should also include utilizing RPE over two paths with differing characteristics such as link quality
and hop count.
The evaluation of RPE needs to be broadened to include more realistic propagation models
and different traffic patterns, as well as varied topologies. These could include larger networks to

Sensors 2020, 20, 2890

15 of 17

observe scalability, and topologies from [18] for comparison with PAREO mechanisms. Experiments in
real-world scenarios and testbeds would also be valuable.
Our implementation is limited to two disjoint paths, but extra paths could be implemented if the
network has a denser topology. This would increase reliability further with a drawback of increased
energy consumption.
In the current design, the traffic is always scheduled at Path A. However, implementing load
balancing decreases energy consumption by distributing the load at both paths.

Abstract: Cooperative driving is an essential component of intelligent transport systems (ITSs). It
promises greater safety, reduced accidents, efficient traffic flow, and fuel consumption reduction.
Vehicle platooning is a representative service model for ITS. The principal sub-systems of platooning
systems for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)
systems and platoon management systems. Based on vehicle state information received through
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, the CACC system allows platoon vehicles to maintain a
narrower safety distance. In addition, the platoon management system using V2V communications
allows vehicles to perform platoon maneuvers reliably and accurately. In this paper, we propose a
CACC system with a variable time headway and a decentralized platoon join-in-middle maneuver
protocol with a trajectory planning system considering the V2V communication delay for CAVs. The
platoon join-in-middle maneuver is a challenging research subject as the research must consider the
requirement of a more precise management protocol and lateral control for platoon safety and string
stability. These CACC systems and protocols are implemented on a simulator for a connected and
automated vehicle system, PreScan, and we validated our approach using a realistic control system
and V2V communication system provided by PreScan.

1. Introduction
In the research field of autonomous vehicles, cooperative driving technology using
communication between vehicles has attracted considerable attention. Through the adaptation and development of cooperative driving technologies in the perception, decisionmaking, and control layers of autonomous vehicles, intelligent transport systems (ITSs)
improve vehicle safety, traffic efficiency, and fuel efficiency, which is called Cooperative-ITS
(C-ITS). The typical system of C-ITS is platooning, which allows several grouped vehicles
to maintain a narrow distance between them and drive at the same speed. The narrow gap
between the platooned vehicles leads to a decrease in air resistance, which reduces the fuel
consumption of the platoon vehicles. In addition, the consensus-based platoon maneuver
between platoon vehicles improves traffic flow and safety [1,2]. In general, most research
in platooning systems focuses on string stability through the control system and platoon
management through the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication system.
The core of the control system for platoons is the adaptive cruise control (ACC) system.
The ACC system calculates the distance and speed from the preceding vehicle (PV) using
on-board sensors, such as radar sensors, and automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to
maintain a safe distance from the PV. Recently, the cooperative ACC (CACC) system has
become an important research topic as it enables the sharing of kinematic information

between vehicles through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The kinematic information of PV allows the vehicle to perceive the change in the motion of PV more accurately
and rapidly, thereby allowing the host vehicle (HV) to maintain a narrow distance with
safety guarantees [3,4].
The platoon management system is key to properly supporting platoon maneuvers
of platoon vehicles. The system enables the performance of platoon maneuvers such
as generation, merging, splitting, joining, and leaving of the platoon through dedicated
protocols and platoon information (platoon ID, platoon size, platoon member, platoon
speed, etc.) management. Based on the exchange of vehicle state information and maneuver
protocol messages through V2X communication, the platoon management system supports
a platooning system safely and efficiently [5].
The platooning system is designed in accordance with the V2X communication topology [6–8]. Typically, in a centralized communication topology, the leader vehicle that
creates a platoon and leads the vehicles in the platoon determines all actions, and the
member vehicles communicate directly with the leader to receive the platoon information
and decisions. Here, the leader vehicle gathers information from the member vehicles
periodically, determines the appropriate behavior of the member vehicles, and relays the
decisions. However, owing to the characteristics of wireless communication, the low packet
delivery rate (PDR) caused by the long communication distance from the leader results
in high retransmission delays and reduces string stability. In addition, because the leader
vehicle determines all actions, computation overheads of the leader vehicle and limited
execution of the simultaneous maneuver occur, which can lead to a high communication
delay that can affect the platoon maneuver [9]. Therefore, we designed a platooning system
based on a decentralized communication topology where each member vehicle communicates directly with the PV and the following vehicle (FV). It enables member vehicles to
have rapid perception and decision based on low communication delays and low packet
error rate and to drive while maintaining a narrow intra-platoon distance.
Many studies have been conducted on platooning systems using decentralized communication topology [10–12]. However, most studies do not consider communication
delays or packet losses. Although the decentralized approach resolves the high communication delay problem caused by long communication distances from the leader, network
delays can still occur depending on channel congestion and the surrounding environment.
Therefore, V2X communication delays and packet loss must be considered for safe platooning [13,14]. Hu et al. determined the actual communication delay through field tests and
modeled the minimum safe distance according to the communication delay in acceleration,
cruising, and deceleration states [15].
Many studies have investigated the platoon join maneuver, which occurs at the tail
or head of a platoon. However, the maneuver is uncomplicated because it only considers
longitudinal control [5,16–18]. Research on advanced platoon management protocols using
lateral control is required to ensure efficient traffic flow. In the cases of highway on-ramp
or lane reduction due to an obstacle, a platoon management protocol is required to support
joining in the middle of the platoon [19]. Hidalgo et al. proposed a cooperative platoon
merging maneuver based on the CACC system and trajectory planning [20].
In this study, we estimate the communication delay utilizing the cumulative communication delay strategy and apply the delay to a variable time headway for the CACC system,
time-out interval, and trajectory planning for the platoon maneuver protocol. In particular,
we implemented a join-in-middle maneuver protocol among many platoon maneuvers.
The proposed protocol includes (1) a direct and reliable consensus between maneuvering
vehicles using a decentralized communication topology, (2) precise trajectory planning
using cumulative communication delay, and (3) lane changing through lateral control.
The developed platooning system for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs),
including the CACC system and maneuver protocol, was validated on the autonomous
driving simulator PreScan [21]. The simulation results show that the HV joins reliably

in the middle of the platoon, maintaining string stability through a sophisticated control
system and communication system supported by PreScan.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The background of the decentralized platoon join-in-middle maneuver protocol with a variable time headway is presented
in Section 2. The details of the proposed platooning system are presented in Section 3.
Section 4 describes the simulation environment and evaluation results of the platoon joinin-middle maneuvering. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.
2. Background: Motivation and Related Work
In our study, we used a decentralized communication topology to design a platooning
system for CAVs as shown in Figure 1. The platoon member vehicle uses the vehicle state
information received from the PV for the CACC system. The free agent also periodically
communicates with nearby vehicles before participating in the platoon. After deciding to
participate in the platoon, the free agent selects PV and FV based on its current position
and performs a join-in-middle maneuver by exchanging protocol messages with those
vehicles. In this section, along with a brief background, we explain the distinct features of
our approach.

Figure 1. Decentralized platooning system of connected and automated vehicles.

2.1. Decentralized Platooning System
The flow topology of information over V2X communication has a significant impact on
the design of platooning systems for CAVs. The source of information used in the control
and platoon management systems varies depending on the topology, which affects the
inter-vehicle distance, reaction time, management complexity, and maneuverability. Two
approaches typically exist: the centralized approach, where the leader takes the platoon
management and decision, and the decentralized approach, where each platoon member
vehicle manages platoon information and determines its behavior.
There are many existing centralized platoon systems [22–24]. However, owing to
the characteristics of wireless communication, the PDR decreases as the distance between
the leader and member vehicle increases, which causes significant communication delays
owing to packet retransmission. In such a situation where communication between the
leader and the member vehicle is unstable, platooning according to the information from the
leader is not possible, and the safety and efficiency of the platoon are significantly reduced.
To address this problem, a decentralized platoon maintenance approach is being
investigated. Won et al. [17] suggested a method to address the degradation of leader–
member communication performance in long platoons by designating a member vehicle
that has a lower communication PDR with the leader as a virtual leader. However, platoon
management is still conducted on vehicles that act as leaders, and frequent selection

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

of leaders in poor communication conditions can further exacerbate channel conditions.
Fida et al. proposed an improved multiple management protocol that supports multiple
maneuvers simultaneously through a decentralized approach [10]. The protocol handles
multiple join and leave maneuvers that occur simultaneously through V2I communication
with the maneuvering vehicle and road side unit (RSU). However, because all information
is transmitted to the RSU and all maneuvers are performed through the RSU, the processing
time of the maneuver can be extended. In addition, the surrounding dynamic environment
of the maneuvering vehicle may not be reflected in real time. Therefore, we have designed
a decentralized platooning system that allows each vehicle to independently manage
the platoon information based on bidirectional communication with the PV and FV and
performs platoon maneuvers reliably by exchanging protocol messages between maneuverrelated vehicles.
2.2. Variable Time Headway for CACC System
The spacing strategy, one of the key parameters of the CACC system, determines the
distance from the PV and enables the controller to calculate the target speed. The spacing
strategy should be reasonably designed because it directly affects the safety and efficiency
of the platooning system. The spacing strategies are divided into two types: the constant
spacing strategy, which maintains the inter-vehicle distance constantly, and the variable
spacing (VS) strategy, which modifies the inter-vehicle distance by considering the driving
environment [25].
The VS strategy, which is primarily used in CACC systems, determines the intraplatoon distance based on the time headway. Because the intra-platoon distance changes
depending on the vehicle speed, stable platooning is possible. The VS strategy that sets
the time headway to a certain value is called the constant-time headway (CTH) strategy,
which is used in many platooning system studies [26,27]. However, to design a more
realistic platooning system, complex variables such as traffic flow, network delay, and CAV
processing time must be considered, which is called the variable time headway (VTH)
strategy. Wang and Rajamani proposed an improved VTH strategy considering traffic
density [28]. Yanakiev and Kanellakopoulos proposed a VTH strategy considering the
relative speed between the HV and PV [29].
In CACC systems utilizing the speed and acceleration values of PV received via
V2V communication, communication delay can also have a significant impact on the
decision of the time headway [30]. If a communication channel is congested and a high
communication delay occurs, the HV should have a variable time headway depending on
the condition of the channel because it cannot be informed in time. Therefore, we applied a
variable time headway that considers the estimated communication delay with the PV in
the CACC system.
2.3. Platoon Join-in-Middle Maneuver Protocol
The characteristic of a platooning system for CAVs is that the exchange of maneuver
protocol messages allows CAVs to perform platoon maneuvers, such as join, leave, merge,
and split, efficiently and safely. In particular, the maneuver protocol for joining the platoon
in another lane supports the safe lane-changing operation of the joining vehicle (JV). In this
case, the JV can attempt to change the lane after moving to the head or tail of the platoon
such that it does not affect the platoon member vehicles. However, if it is difficult to reach
to the head or tail of the platoon owing to the traffic flow of the current lane, the JV should
attempt to join in the middle of the platoon.
The join-in-middle protocol is more challenging than other maneuvers because it
requires the creation of a gap and lane changing based on precise time calculation and
consensus between the JV and FV. Table 1 summarizes the recent studies on the join-inmiddle maneuver protocol. Liu et al. proposed a join-in-middle maneuver protocol using
merge, split, and lane change actions gradually [31]. However, a centralized topology can
cause a time delay in opening the gap and changing lane, and various interferences can

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

5 of 15

occur during the delay. Segata et al. designed a protocol for a join-in-middle maneuver
considering various interferences [32]. However, because the leader vehicle manages the
maneuver, it cannot support multiple maneuvers simultaneously. For example, while
one vehicle joins the platoon, the other vehicle cannot perform a join or leave maneuver.
Renzler et al. proposed an efficient maneuver protocol in a dynamic environment using
a decentralized topology [13]. However, safe trajectory planning for lane changing is
as important as the design of the protocol in the CAV platoon join-in-middle maneuver
management system. Therefore, in this paper, we design the join-in-middle maneuver
protocol for the CAV, which includes the efficient opening gap strategy of FV, safe lanechanging trajectory planning of JV, considering the dynamic surrounding environment and
communication delay.

3. Decentralized Platoon Join-in-Middle Protocol with Variable Time Headway
3.1. Architecture of a Platooning System for Connected and Automated Vehicle
The structure of the CAV comprises three layers: perception, decision-making, and
control layers [33]. In the perception layer, sensors (Radar, Lidar, GPS, Camera, etc.)
perceive the surrounding environment and perform positioning and map construction.
The information is passed on to the decision-making layer and used for global planning,
behavioral planning, and local planning. When a trajectory is created through behavioral
planning and local planning, the CAV is driven along the path through the controller.
Figure 2 shows the architecture of a platooning system for CAVs. We assume that
the behavioral planning system determines the join-in-middle maneuver and selects FV
and PV, which are the destination of the protocol message, based on the current position.
The scope of our study is the exchange of join-in-middle control protocol messages over
V2V communication, variable time headway calculation and trajectory generation in local
planning, and control including the CACC system.
3.2. Estimation of Communication Delay
CAVs broadcast state information periodically through V2V communication. This
information is contained in the basic safety message (BSM) format, which complies with
the SAE J2735 standard [34]. In our plating system, the BSM is used to calculate the
communication delays. The platoon member vehicle receives a BSM from its PV, records a
communication delay on the platoon table with the state information of the PV, and utilizes
the information to calculate the variable time headway and target speed for the CACC.
Non-platooned vehicles record the V2V communication delay and location information
of all surrounding CAVs in the neighbor table, as in our previous study, and utilize the
neighbor table to select the target vehicle and create the trajectory required to perform
the platoon join-in-middle maneuver [33]. The communication delay was calculated as a
weighted average.
updated_tw,i ← (1 − α) × tw,i + α × tr,i ,
(1)

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

where i is the CAV identification, tw,i is the weighted average communication delay with
CAV i, tr,i is the latest end-to-end delay with CAV i. Deviations devw,i are also calculated to
deal with the variability of the communication delay.
updated_devw,i ← (1 − β) × devw,i + β × |tr,i − tw,i |,

(2)

In this study, we further considered time-out events to cope with the failure of protocol
behavior owing to packet loss and high communication delay that can occur in V2V
communication. To set the time-out interval, we modified the time-out interval formula
used in computer networks [35].
ttime out = 2 × maxtw,i + 8 × devw,argmaxtw,i ,
i

(3)

3.3. Variable Time Headway for CACC System
The platooned vehicle recognizes kinematic information such as location, speed,
acceleration, and deceleration of the vehicle ahead through V2V communication in real
time, calculates the safe distance based on it, and transmits it to the CACC controller. The
perception time is determined by the communication delay with the PV and has a changing
value depending on the channel status. In our system, an estimated communication delay
with the PV was used in the calculation of the time headway for safety distance, which
improved the stability of the system.
theadway = tde f ault + tw,PV + devw,PV ,

(4)

where theadway is the time headway considering the communication delay, and tde f ault is
the default time headway of the CACC system. However, if the estimated communication
delay in the platoon table is not updated during two consecutive periods owing to packet
loss, the system determines that there is a problem with V2V communication and uses the
time headway of the ACC system, which utilizes the radar sensor instead of the CACC
time headway.
3.4. Decentralized Platoon Join-in-Middle Protocol
After the perception of the platoon driving in the next lane and the determination of
the join-in-middle maneuver in the behavioral planning, the HV selects PV and FV based
on their current position and performs a join-in-middle maneuver by exchanging protocol
messages with them. Figures 3 and 4 show the final state machine of the join-in-middle

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

maneuver protocol. Figure 3 shows the state machine of the member vehicle, and Figure 4
shows the state machine of the JV.

Figure 3. State machine of platoon member vehicle.

Figure 4. State machine of joining vehicle.

Two states exist for the member vehicle: CACC and open gap. The member vehicle
calculates the communication delay based on the BSM received from the PV, updates the
platoon table, and drives while maintaining a safe distance. When the member vehicle
receives a join request message from the JV, the member vehicle provides platoon information and vehicle state information to the JV through a join response message if the joining
is allowed. The member vehicle allows the JV to join if the member vehicle is driving at a
constant speed without any other maneuvering in progress. When an open gap request
message is received in response to a join response message, the FV starts decelerating to
create a gap and transitions to an open gap state. If a duplicate open-gap request message
is received in the open-gap state, the FV extends the time to maintain the gap. When a
lane-changing-done message is received from the JV, the FV transitions to the CACC state

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

8 of 15

after updating the platoon table. Both PV and FV finish the join-in-middle maneuver by
sending an acknowledgment (ACK) message for the lane-changing-done message from JV.
Three states for joining vehicles exist: the platoon join start, lane changing, and CACC.
When the JV determines the platoon join-in-middle maneuver, it selects PV and FV and
transmits a join request message to them. When the JV receives a response message from
the PV and FV, it sends an open-gap request message and plans a trajectory for the join-inmiddle based on the PV and FV state information and platoon information. After receiving
an ACK message from the FV in the lane-changing state, JV performs lane changing along
the expected trajectory. When the JV joins the platoon via lane changing, it becomes a
CACC state and transmits a lane-changing-done message to the PV and FV, confirming that
it has joined the platoon. With the receipt of ACK messages for the lane- changing-done
messages, JV finishes the join-in-middle maneuver and becomes a member vehicle.
We designed the join-in-middle maneuver to be stable through a time-out event and
ACK message exchange dealing with high communication delay or packet loss during
protocol progress.
3.5. Local Planning for Platoon Join-in-Middle Protocol
We design the join-in-middle trajectory in three phases: preparation, opening gap,
and lane-changing phases. Figure 5 shows the expected trajectory for the join-in-middle
maneuver generated by the local planning.

Figure 5. Construction of the expected trajectory.

First, in the preparation phase, JV calculates the time of each of the three phases and
determines the position, speed, and steering value based on the time required to generate
the trajectory. The preparation phase begins the moment the JV receives a join response
message from the FV. This is because the deceleration, acceleration, and speed information
contained in the join response message of the FV are required to calculate the delay of
the opening gap phase. It also provides flexibility in dealing with the modification of the
trajectory owing to the retransmission of the message. Therefore, the preparation delay is
defined as the sum of the communication delay, delay variance, and processing delay of JV
and FV.
t prepare = tw,FV + devw,FV + t processing,JV + t processing,FV ,
(5)
where tw,FV is the communication delay with the FV on the neighbor table and devw,FV is
the deviation of the communication delay with FV, t processing,JV is the processing time at
which JV generates the entire trajectory, and t processing,FV is the time at which FV calculates
the size of the gap and determines the deceleration based on the platoon information.
During this phase, it is assumed that all vehicles are driven at the same speed.
Second, in the opening gap phase, the FV decelerates to open the gap such that the
JV can enter the platoon. The strategy for calculating the delay in the opening gap phase
is as follows: The JV maintains the longitudinal speed at the platoon speed and changes
lanes. The opening gap phase of the FV comprises time t1 , at which the deceleration to
open the gap of the FV is finished, and time t2 , at which the FV reaches the platoon speed
through acceleration. At the end of the acceleration, the FV must maintain an intra-platoon

Sensors 2021, 21, 7126

distance with the JV. The opening gap delay of JV is time t1 at which the FV has reached
the minimum speed, and the JV starts the lane changing at t1 . Consequently, the trajectory
is designed to enable the JV to safely complete the join-in-middle maneuver in the shortest
time without disturbing while the gap is open.
Figure 6 shows the speed changes of the JV and FV in the opening gap phase for the
calculation of the opening gap delay.

3.6. Controller
In our platooning system, CAV uses PID control for longitude control. The ACC
system of the platoon member vehicle sets the speed of the PV received via V2V communication as the target speed and controls the speed using the PID error, which is the difference
between the current and target speeds. In addition, standstill distance and variable time
headway are provided as inputs to the ACC system; thus, if the inter-vehicle distance
recognized through the radar is reduced below the safety distance, CAV decelerates to
maintain a safe distance considering the relative speed of the PV. If the inter-vehicle distance is longer than the safety distance, the ACC system narrows the distance by setting a
higher target speed. All maneuvers are controlled with the appropriate margin such that
the speed fluctuations of the vehicle are not large.
Pure pursuit control was used as a lateral control method for lane changing. The pure
pursuit algorithm calculates the steering angle using a look-a-head point to follow the
expected trajectory, and the steering angle is passed to the vehicle dynamics model.
4. Evaluation
4.1. Experimental Setup
We used Simcenter PreScan to validate the proposed platooning system. PreScan
provides a variety of sensor systems, including V2V communication, vehicle dynamics, and
control functions, to simulate CAV systems. In particular, it provides sophisticated vehicle
dynamics and control functions compared to traffic simulators and network simulators;
thus, the influence of platoon maneuvers on string stability can be evaluated more realistically. The 2D simple dynamics model was used as the driving model of the CAV, and the
ACC module was modified to implement our CACC system. However, the communication
system of a PreScan is not as sophisticated as a network simulator. Therefore, we assume
that the V2V communication delay has a normal distribution because limitations exist in
the implementation of realistic V2V channel characteristics and V2V network protocols.
The PDR is modeled with a Bernoulli distribution; however, the probability of loss is
assumed to be very low because we consider a decentralized topology where each CAV
communicates with the PV and FV.
In the simulation scenario, each CAV is equipped with two RADAR sensors and V2V
communication devices that comply with the IEEE 802.11p/WAVE standard [36]. There
are eight CAVs in the scenario, and they have a homogeneous type of vehicles. The leader
vehicle drives along a set straight path and a uniform speed profile, and the rest of the
vehicle drives through the implemented control system. The simulation starts with a
platoon composed of seven vehicles in the first lane and a JV in the second lane, which
drives right next to the second vehicle of the platoon.
Figure 7 shows the function blocks used in the simulation and the data flow. The
parameters used in the simulation scenario are presented in Table 2.

x-position as veh3 at the start. When veh2 transmits a join request message to veh1 and
veh3 in 0.5 s, the join-in-middle maneuver starts. After receiving a join response message
in 0.64 s, veh2 enters the preparation phase. In the preparation phase, veh2 generates a
join-in-middle maneuver trajectory and transmits an open gap message to veh3. After
receiving an open gap message in 0.81 s, veh3 changes the CACC system setting and starts
decelerating in 0.91 s. veh3 decelerates for 2.4 s to open the gap and accelerates for 2.6 s to
restore the existing platoon speed. As veh3 decelerates and accelerates, the speed of veh4–8
changes sequentially to maintain a safe distance. When the opening gap phase ends in
3.14 s, veh2 starts changing lanes to join in the platoon. After finishing the join-in-middle
maneuver in 6.04 s, all vehicles drive at a similar speed.

Figure 8. Position of vehicles.

Figure 9. Inter vehicle distance of vehicles.

Figure 9 shows the inter-vehicle distance based on the x-position of each vehicle.
Platoon member vehicles were initially driven with an inter-vehicle distance of 18 m. The
inter-vehicle distance of vehicles after veh3 is slightly reduced when the join maneuver
starts and veh3 starts decelerating in 0.91 s, and veh3–8 try to restore the existing safety
distance through CACC system. The result shows that the vehicle farther away from veh2
is less affected by the join-in-middle maneuver. veh4, which was directly affected by the
deceleration of veh3, has an error of up to 5% compared to the reference intra-platoon
distance; however, it does not affect the string stability as the distance is restored after 10 s.
Although the distance between veh2 and veh3 has small fluctuation owing to lane-changing
of veh2, it also does not significantly affect the safety and string stability of the platoon as a
deviation of the distance is maintained within small range. Finally, the platoon recovers its
string stability within 20 s after finishing the join-in-middle maneuver.

Figure 10. Speed of vehicles.

Figure 10 shows the change in speed of each vehicle. veh3 decelerates to 12.3 m/s
to open the gap, and the variance is propagated to the following vehicles. After reaching
its lowest speed, it immediately attempts to accelerate; however, it is delayed for 0.2 s
owing to the influence of the control system. After reaching the platoon speed of 20 m/s,
veh3 attempts to maintain the safety distance through PID control. Owing to the change in
speed of veh3, the speed of the FVs of veh3 has small fluctuation to keep safety distance;
however, it is due to limitation of PID control, and the deviation of the speed is very small,
so it does not affect string stability.
Through simulation, we verified that our platoon join-in-middle maneuver does not
significantly affect the string stability and operates safely in a short time. This results
from direct communication with adjacent vehicles, reliable protocol procedures, and an
elaborate trajectory design that considers communication delays.
5. Conclusions
This paper presents a decentralized platooning system for CAVs and the platoon joinin-middle maneuver protocol. The platooning system of CAVs used V2V communication
to determine the target speed and safety distance and to perform platoon maneuvers. V2V
communication delays and packet losses can affect the string stability of platoons. In this
study, we calculated the variable time headway of the CACC system and generated a
join-in-middle trajectory by considering the communication delay and packet loss. The
variable time headway helps maintain a safe intra-platoon distance by reflecting the
congestion of the V2V communication channel. Our join-in-middle protocol considers
communication delays, retransmissions, and the opening gap delay in the FV to generate
a join-in-middle trajectory; thus, the maneuver is performed quickly without affecting
the string stability. The simulator PreScan was used to validate our platooning system,
including V2V communication, longitude control, and lateral control, and the results
showed a time of 5.5 s to finish the join-in-maneuver and a time of 25 s to restore string
stability with a low-speed variance.
Several studies need to be conducted to improve our system for application to various
real environments. First, research into heterogeneous vehicle platooning systems, such as
those involving safe distance strategies considering various types of vehicle dynamics, is
required. Second, V2V communication is affected by the environment, such as the congestion of vehicles and obstacles. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the V2V communication

Abstract

Quantum theory is indeterministic, but not completely so. When a system is
in a pure state there are properties it possesses with certainty, known as actual
properties. The actual properties of a quantum system (in a pure state) fully
determine the probability of finding the system to have any other property. We
will call this principle, wherein the deterministic elements of a theory completely characterise the probabilistic elements, intermediate determinism. In
dimensions of at least three, intermediate determinism in quantum theory is
guaranteed by the structure of its lattice of properties. This observation follows
from Gleason’s theorem, which is why it fails to hold in dimension two. In
this work we extend the idea of intermediate determinism from properties to
measurements. Under this extension intermediate determinism follows from
the structure of quantum effects for separable Hilbert spaces of any dimension,
including dimension two. Then, we find necessary and sufficient conditions
for a general probabilistic theory to obey intermediate determinism. We show
that, although related, both the no-restriction hypothesis and a Gleason-type
theorem are neither necessary nor sufficient for intermediate determinism.

It is well-known that in quantum theory properties of physical systems cannot be predicted with
certainty. On the contrary, even with perfect knowledge of the state of the system one may only

deduce its propensity to actualise1 a given property. Although quantum theory contains this
intrinsic uncertainty it is not completely devoid of deterministic measurement events. Given an
eigenstate of an observable A with eigenvalue a, a system in this eigenstate will be deterministically found to have the property A = a upon the measurement of A. We say that this property
is an actual property of the system in this state.
Gisin [1] defines an intermediate level between complete determinism and complete randomness wherein the actual properties of the system fully determine its propensity to take other
properties. In other words, the (pure) state of the system is entirely determined by its actual
properties. In this work, we will capture this idea in the principle of intermediate determinism,
which says that the deterministic elements of a theory should encode a full description of the
probabilistic elements.
Gisin proposes two axioms as a means to derive quantum and classical physics. The first
is equivalent to intermediate determinism for the properties of a system. The second says that
every property should be an actual property of some state. It remains an open question whether
there exist theories satisfying Gisin’s axioms in addition to those described by quantum and
classical physics2 .
However, even upon a negative resolution to this question the approach would not allow for
a derivation of quantum theory in its entirety; the proposed axioms rule out two-level quantum
systems. This exclusion follows from the absence of Gleason’s theorem for two dimensional
complex Hilbert spaces. Unlike in higher dimensions, when considering only the structure of
the properties of two-level quantum systems there are many more possible states than those
described by density operators. As a result, none of the possible states have a unique set of
actual properties and thus, all are prohibited by Gisin’s axioms.
Two-level systems do, on the other hand, admit a Gleason-type theorem when one considers
generalised observables given by positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs) [2–4]. Additionally, Gleason-type theorems have been proven for general probabilistic theories (GPTs)
[5]: a broad class of theories derived from operational assumptions and used in a wide variety
of contexts, e.g. see [6–20]. In this work we investigate intermediate determinism in this setting where Gleason-type results are more readily available. We aim to better understand the
potential features of GPTs that are not present in quantum theory. Furthermore, we wish to
introduce a way in which intermediate determinism can be used as an axiom for quantum theory without ruling out two-level quantum systems and can be combined with the operational
reasoning of GPTs.
Although inspired by properties, intermediate determinism can equally be applied to measurements. The analogous statement is that every pure state of the system is uniquely identified
by its actual effects. Effects are elements of a physical theory that represent equivalence classes
of measurement outcomes, wherein two outcomes are equivalent if they are predicted to occur
with the same probability as each other for any state of the system. In other words, the outcomes
in an equivalence class are operationally indistinguishable. The actual effects of a system in
a given state are those whose outcomes occur with certainty.

We follow the usage of propensity in [1] to mean the probability of a non-necessary (and non-predetermined) event.
Accordingly, the propensity of a system to actualise a property would be the propensity of an outcome of an ideal
measurement indicating that the system has that property immediately after the measurement.
2 And also those that are sufficiently small, in that their property lattices contain three or fewer atoms, see section 2
or [1].

First, we consider intermediate determinism for effects in quantum theory. As with properties, quantum theory as a whole obeys intermediate determinism for effects. However, unlike
with quantum properties, this fact now follows from the structure of quantum effects for all
separable Hilbert spaces, including in dimension two, thanks to the Gleason-type theorem for
POVMs. Therefore, analogous axioms for effects as those proposed by Gisin for properties
would no longer rule out two-level quantum systems.
Second, we consider intermediate determinism for effects in GPTs. We say that the principle
is satisfied when each of the extremal points of the state spaces in the GPT has a unique set
of actual effects. Unlike quantum theory, not all GPTs have this property. As our main result,
theorem 1, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a GPT to obey intermediate
determinism for effects. Although related, satisfaction of the no-restriction hypothesis [21, 22]
and the existence of a Gleason-type theorem [5] are both found to be neither necessary nor
sufficient for intermediate determinism.
In section 2 we summarise the relevant parts of the [1] which inspired the present work.
Section 3 treats the case of quantum properties again but removes the dependency on the lattice structure. This allows us to define the principle of intermediate determinism for properties in such a way that it can be consistently generalised to quantum effects (which do not
form a lattice) and, thus, we recover the standard description of pure states. In section 4,
we introduce the relevant parts of the GPT framework. In section 5 we define intermediate
determinism for GPT effects and present our main result, theorem 1, in which we identify
the exact class of GPTs that obey this principle. We proceed by giving some examples of
GPT systems that could and could not be part of a GPT that obeys intermediate determinism
in section 6. In this section we also give a corollary to our main result establishing exactly
which GPTs obeying the no-restriction hypothesis also satisfy intermediate determinism. In
section 7 we find which GPTs obey the stronger requirement that the intermediate determinism follow from the effect space structure. Finally, section 8 then briefly lays out how the
concepts in this work allow intermediate determinism to be a possible axiom for deriving
quantum theory in combination with the GPT framework without ruling out two-level quantum
systems.

2. Propensity functions
In this section we will summarise the intermediate level between determinism and randomness introduced by Gisin [1]. Gisin begins with the premise, established and motivated by Piron
[23, 24] and Aerts [25, 26], that the properties of a system must form a complete orthomodular lattice. A complete lattice is a∨partially ordered set (L, ⩽) such that any subset
∧ K⊆L
has a least upper bound denoted k∈K k, and a greatest lower bound denoted k∈K k. We
denote the greatest lower bound of a lattice of properties L by 0, representing a property the
system will never be found to possess. The partial order is interpreted as l ⩽ k if property
l implies property k, i.e. if property l is actual so is property k. A lattice L is orthomodular if it has a complement operation, denoted by ·c , such that (a) (lc )c = l; (b) l ⩽ lc only if
l = 0; (c) l ⩽ k only if lc ⩾ kc ; and, (d) if l ⩽ k then there exists j ∈ L such that j ⩽ lc and
j ∨ l = k. The complement lc is interpreted as the property of not having the property l. If
l ⩽ kc we say that l and k are orthogonal which is interpreted as the properties being disjoint
but jointly measurable or testable and thus, never both being actual properties of a system in
some state.

A state specifies the propensity of the system to actualise any given property from the lattice
of properties L. Thus, for each state there is a generalised probability measure on the lattice
of properties as defined below.
Definition 1. A generalised probability measure on a lattice of properties L, is a map v : L →
[0, 1] such that

(a) for any sequence(lj )j ofpairwise orthogonal elements of L,
∨
∑
v  lj  =
v(lj ) ,
j

(2.1)

j

and,
∨
(b) v(I) = 1, where I ∈ L denotes the greatest element of L, I = l∈L l.
Note that generalised probability measures on a property lattice are more general than the
measures on property lattices considered in [1]. Measures also satisfy the following condition
in addition to those from definition 1:
(⋆) for any subset K ⊂ L such that v(k) = 1 for all k ∈ K, v(

∧

k∈K k)

= 1.

Gisin notes that this condition has been criticised and since it will not be relevant for the results
of the present paper we exclude it from definition 1 of a generalised probability measure on a
property lattice.
∧
For any measure v, [1] defines the least actual property of v as lv = {l ∈ L|v(l) = 1}. Note
that lv is guaranteed to itself be an actual property of v by condition (⋆). It follows that l ∈ L
is an actual property of v if and only if lv ⩽ l. With this framework in place one can define
Gisin’s intermediate level of determinism as the requirement that a pure state be a measure v
uniquely defined by its actual properties or, equivalently, its least actual property lv . Hence,
any pure state can be represented by a lattice propensity function.
Definition 2. A lattice propensity function on a property lattice L is a measure v on L with a

unique least actual property, lv , i.e. if w is a measure, we have lw = lv if and only if w = v.
Gisin [1] uses the definition of a pure state as a lattice propensity function along with an axiom
requiring that every (non-zero) property be actual for some state to narrow down the possible
lattices of properties. The aim is to find that property lattices must also be atomic (and have
at least four atoms) and satisfy the covering law. Such properties lattices are known to always
be part of classical or quantum physics due to a result of Piron [1, 23, 27]. Gisin’s axiom
is shown to imply the lattice must be atomic and furthermore, all identified examples (with at
least four orthogonal atoms) satisfy the covering law. However, it remains to be shown whether
the covering law holds in general3 .
Although it is a possibility that only classical and quantum theories satisfy Gisin’s axiom,
we already know that this approach cannot derive quantum theory in its entirety since it rules
out two-level or qubit systems.
The property lattice of a system in classical physics is given by the power set, P(Γ), of
its phase space, Γ. The partial order is given by inclusion and the complement is defined in
the standard way, Xc = Γ/X, for X ∈ P(Γ). A lattice propensity function on this lattice assigns
3

In an earlier work [27] the result of Piron was successfully used to single out classical and quantum theories by
employing similar but stronger axioms.

V J Wright

probability one to a point, x ∈ Γ, of phase space and all the subsets containing that point. This
assignment of probabilities coincides with the pure state described by the point x. It is clear
that Gisin’s axioms are satisfied.
On the other hand, quantum property lattices are given by the orthogonal projections4 P(H)
onto closed subspaces of a given (complex) separable Hilbert space, H. When H has dimension
at least three Gleason’s theorem ensures the existence of lattice propensity functions. Namely,
each lattice propensity function is given by the Born rule for some pure state, i.e. the functions
v(Π) = ⟨ψ, Πψ⟩ for some unit vector ψ ∈ H for all Π ∈ P(H). However, Gleason’s theorem
does not hold in dimension two, and it follows that there exist no propensity functions on the
lattice P(C2 ).
Explicitly, given any projection Π ∈ P(C2 ) then there are infinitely many generalised
probability measures5 v such that lv = Π. Firstly, if Π is rank-one, two possibilities are,
v1 (Π ′ ) = Tr(Π ′ Π) and v2 (Π ′ ) = 2(δΠ,Π ′ −1) − δI−Π,Π ′ /2 for any rank-one projection Π ′ ,
where δ denotes the Kronecker-delta function. Alternatively, if Π is rank-two we have Π = I,
the identity operator on C2 . Then v(Π ′ ) = Tr(Π ′ ρ) for any rank-two density operator ρ, gives
lv = I. And finally6 , if Π = 0 then for any v such that v(Π) = v(Π ′ ) = 1 for rank-one projections Π ̸= Π ′ , we have in lv = Π.
With no lattice propensity functions, it is impossible for the lattice P(C2 ) to satisfy the
requirement that every property is an actual property for some lattice propensity function/state.
Therefore, the two axioms rule out two-level quantum systems.
In contrast to Gleason’s original theorem, a Gleason-type theorem does hold in dimension
two [2, 3]. This Gleason-type theorem concerns generalised probability measures on the set
of quantum effects, E(H). Note that the definition 1 of a generalised probability measure does
not rely upon every feature of a complete orthomodular lattice. We may therefore define a
generalised probability measure on a more general structure such that definition 1 is recovered
for complete orthomodular lattices, whilst the existing definition on quantum effects is also
recovered. The generalised probability measure will also coincide with those considered in
Gleason-type theorems for GPTs [5, 29]. The general structure and definition of a generalised
probability measure is described in detail in appendix A. For simplicity in the main text we
will only state the resulting maps on the structures we study.
3. Quantum theory
3.1. Projections

In this section, we will consider the case of the quantum property lattice again. In contrast with
the treatment of the previous section we will not use the lattice structure of the projections
P(H) so that we can generalise the definitions later to non-lattice structures. Based on the
ideas of [1] but using our lattice-free approach we will then define propensity functions and
intermediate determinism for properties.

4 In the example from the introduction, for an observable A given by a self-adjoint operator Â with an eigenvalue a,
the property A = a is given by the orthogonal projection on to the eigenspace {ψ|Âψ = aψ} of Â with eigenvalue a.
This property is actual for all states in the eigenspace.
5 Some of these generalised probability measures are the deterministic ontic states that allow for Kochen-Specker
noncontextual ontological models of a qubit to be constructed [28].
6 This final set of measures is ruled out by condition (2) on a measure in [1]. This difference leads to the same
conclusion that there are no lattice propensity functions on P(C2 ).

The projections P(H) form a lattice with the ordering Π ⩾ Π ′ if and only if Π − Π ′ ∈
P(H). The sets of maps given by definitions 1 and 19 of a generalised probability measure7
coincide on P(H) to give:
Definition 3. A generalised probability measure v on P(H) is a map v : P(H) → [0, 1] such

∑
∑
that v( j Πj ) = j v(Πj ) for all sequences of mutually orthogonal projections (Πj )j ⊂ P(H)
and v(IH ) = 1.

Propensity functions are intended to represent states that are uniquely identified by their actual
properties amongst all possible states, i.e. generalised probability measures. Since P(H) forms
a complete lattice the set of actual properties of a state can be identified by its greatest lower
bound. In the case of P(H) this greatest lower bound is also an actual property, referred to
as the least actual property. However, since we are attempting to remove the dependence of
our definitions on the lattice structure we will utilise the following less elegant but more direct
concept of an actual set in place of the least actual property. We define the actual set of a generalised probability measure v on a property lattice L as the subset Av = {Π ∈ L|v(Π) = 1} ⊂ L.
We may now give an alternative definition of a propensity function on L, based on generalised probability measures instead of measures. This definition is equivalent to definition 2 for
the lattice P(H), and still captures the idea that these states are uniquely identified by their
actual properties.
Definition 4. A propensity function on a property lattice L is a generalised probability measure
v on L such that we have: Av = Av ′ for a generalised probability measure v ′ = v on L implies
v ′ = v.

Note that in a general lattice the greatest lower bound of the set of actual properties of a
generalised probability measure is not necessarily an actual property itself. For this reason,
the additional condition (⋆) is imposed on measures. However, since in definition 4 the least
actual property is replaced by the actual set, the condition (⋆) is no longer necessary. For Hilbert spaces of dimension at least three the equivalence of definitions 2 and 4 of a propensity
function on the lattice of quantum properties can be seen by the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let H be a separable Hilbert space with dimension at least three. Every propensity

function v : P(H) → [0, 1] admits an expression
v(Π) = ⟨ψ, Πψ⟩ ,

(3.1)

for all Π ∈ P(H) and some unit vector ψ ∈ H.
Proof. By Gleason’s theorem, v(Π) = Tr(Πρ) for some density operator ρ. In this case denote

Av by Aρ . Now, we find Π ∈ Aρ if and only if Π = Πsupp(ρ) + Π ′ , for the projection Π ′ on to
some subspace of ker(ρ), where Πsupp (ρ) is the orthogonal projection on to the support of ρ,
as follows. ∑
Let ρ = j λj Pj be a spectral decomposition of ρ where Pj are rank-one projections
on
∑
to a subspace spanned by a unit vector ψ j and let Π ∈ Aρ . Since 0 ⩽ λj ⩽ 1, j λj = 1 and
0 ⩽ Tr(ΠPj ) ⩽ 1, we find ⟨ψj , Πψj ⟩ = Tr(ΠPj ) = 1, for all j. The vectors ψ j span the support
of ρ, therefore, we have Πϕ = ϕ, for all ϕ ∈ supp(ρ). The converse is clear.
Notice that Aρ is only a function of the support of ρ, hence any two density operators with
the same support have the same actual set. Given a density operator ρ with ran(ρ) ⩾ 2 there

7

The definition of a measure from [1] also gives the same set of maps as the extra condition (⋆) is automatically
satisfied on this lattice.
6

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

are infinitely many distinct density operators with the same support and therefore the same
actual set. On the other hand, given a rank-one projection P it is clear that P ∈ Aρ if and only
if ρ = P, making Aρ unique to ρ.
Thus Aρ = Aρ ′ implies ρ = ρ ′ if and only if ρ = P for some rank-one projection P, in which
case v(Π) = Tr(ΠP) = ⟨ψ, Πψ⟩, for all Π ∈ P(H), where ψ is a unit vector such that Pψ = ψ.
In dimension two the absence of propensity functions, and hence equivalence of definitions 2
and 4, follows from similar reasoning to that given in section 2.
We now make explicit the definition of intermediate determinism for properties. Given a
theory in which each system has a property lattice L, the states of the theory are given by some
subset S of the generalised probability measures on L (see definition 1). A theory satisfies
intermediate determinism for properties if and only if each of the pure states in S has a unique
actual set when compared with all other states in S.
Definition 5. A theory in which each system has a lattice of properties L and set of states S
satisfies intermediate determinism for properties if and only if for each pure state s ∈ S, we
have: As = As ′ for s ′ ∈ S implies s ′ = s.

Quantum theory, including two-level systems, satisfies intermediate determinism for properties. However, the stronger requirement that the pure states in S have unique actual sets
compared to all other generalised probability measures only holds for quantum systems in
dimension at least three.
Definition 6. Intermediate determinism is guaranteed by a property lattice L if every pure

state of the system is a propensity function on L.
Due to the fact that the pure states of a qubit are not propensity functions, we say that the
property lattice of a qubit does not guarantee intermediate determinism. By this statement we
mean that for each pure state, ψ, of the system there exist other generalised probability measures with the same actual set as ψ. If there were to be a state of the system with such a generalised probability measure (although this is not predicted by quantum theory) then quantum
theory would violate intermediate determinism. In higher dimensions, for pure states no such
additional generalised probability measures exist and, thus, the intermediate determinism is
guaranteed.
3.2. Effects

We now generalise the principle of intermediate determinism from quantum properties to
quantum effects. Consider a quantum system with Hilbert space H. Mathematically, the set of
quantum effects E(H) comprises the self-adjoint operators E on H satisfying 0H ⩽ E ⩽ IH ,
where 0H and IH are the zero and identity operators on H, respectively, and A ⩽ B means
⟨ψ, Aψ⟩ ⩽ ⟨ψ, Bψ⟩ for all ψ ∈ H. Under this order quantum effects form a partially ordered
set but not a lattice since there do not exist unique greatest lower and least upper bounds for
all pairs of effects8 . Thus, effects are generally not interpreted as properties (see section 8).
Observables of a quantum system are most generally represented by POVMs. A POVM
assigns a quantum effect to any subset of the set of values Ω of the observable. Precisely, it
is a map E : Σ → E(H), where Σ is a σ-algebra of subsets of Ω, that is additive E(X ∪ Y) =
E(X) + E(Y) for disjoint subsets X and Y and satisfies E(Ω) = IH .
8

For more detail on this point see, e.g. [30–32].

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

In this way every possible outcome of measuring any observable of the system has an associated quantum effect. Assuming that measurement outcomes with the same effect occur with
the same probability in any state motivates that states should map effects to probabilities via
generalised probability measures, defined as follows [2].
Definition 7. A generalised probability measure v on E(H) is a map v : E(H) → [0, 1] such

∑
∑
∑
that v( j Ej ) = j v(Ej ) for every sequence of effects (Ej )j ⊂ E(H) satisfying j Ej ∈ E(H)
and v(IH ) = 1.

We now say that an actual effect of the system in a given state v is an effect E such that v(E) = 1.
In other words, any of the measurement outcomes, X ∈ Σ, of measuring an observable, E,
that are associated with the effect E (i.e. E(X) = E) occur with certainty when the system
is in state v. We call the set of actual effects, Av = {E ∈ E(H)|v(E) = 1}, of a generalised
probability measure on E(H) its actual set.
Intermediate determinism for effects (also see definition 13) then means that the pure states
of a system are uniquely determined by their actual set. Intermediate determinism for effects is
guaranteed by the quantum effect space (also see definition 18) if each pure state is a propensity
function on E(H).
Definition 8. A propensity function on E(H) is a generalised probability measure v on E(H)

such that for all measures v′ on E(H), Av ′ = Av only if v ′ = v.

Below, we show that the propensity functions on the set of quantum effects E(H) for any
given separable Hilbert space H are exactly the standard set of pure states in quantum theory,
i.e. the rays of H combined with the Born rule. Thus, intermediate determinism for effects
is guaranteed by quantum effect spaces, as with properties (lemma 1). However, for effects
the result also holds in dimension two. This extension is due to the Gleason-type theorem of
Busch [2] and Caves et al [3] holding in dimension two.
Lemma 2. Let H be a separable Hilbert space. Every propensity function v : E(H) → [0, 1]
admits an expression

v(E) = ⟨ψ, Eψ⟩ ,

(3.2)

for all E ∈ E(H) and some unit vector ψ ∈ H.
Proof. By Busch’s theorem, v(E) = Tr(Eρ) for some density operator ρ. Now we find E ∈ Aρ

if and only if E = Πsupp(ρ) + E ′ , for some effect E′ such that supp(E ′ ) ⊆ ker(ρ), as follows.
∑
Let E ∈ Aρ . Since ρ is compact, we may write its spectral decomposition as ρ = j λj Pj
where P∑
j are rank-one projections on to a subspace spanned by a unit vector ψ j . Since 0 ⩽
λj ⩽ 1, j λj = 1 and 0 ⩽ Tr(EPj ) ⩽ 1, we find ⟨ψj , Eψj ⟩ = Tr(EPj ) = 1, for all j. As ψ j is a
unit vector for all j we find Eψj = ψj . The vectors ψ j span the support of ρ, therefore, we have
Eϕ = ϕ, for all ϕ ∈ supp(ρ). The converse is clear.
As with the projection case, notice that Aρ is only a function of the support of ρ, hence any
two density operators with the same support have the same actual set. Given a density operator
ρ with ran(ρ) ⩾ 2 there are infinitely many distinct density operators with the same support
and therefore the same actual set. On the other hand, given a rank-one projection P it is clear
that P ∈ Aρ if and only if ρ = P, making Aρ unique to ρ.
Thus Aρ = Aρ ′ implies ρ = ρ ′ if and only if ρ = P for some rank-one projection P, in
which case v(Π) = Tr(ΠP) = ⟨ψ, Πψ⟩, for all E ∈ E(H), where ψ is a unit vector such
that Pψ = ψ.

4. GPTs framework
GPTs provide a family of operationally motivated physical theories with which to compare
the quantum and classical theories that we believe describe nature. Such theories have been
studied since the 1960s, with important early works including those of Mackey [33], Ludwig
[34, 35] and Kraus [36]. We will briefly summarise the GPT framework, in the formulation
of [5], without the operational motivation. For more details on the modern formulation and
motivation see [6, 7, 9, 37, 38].
A GPT describes a set of GPT systems (as quantum theory describes quantum systems). A
GPT system has a state space S is given by a convex, compact set of vectors of the form
 
x1
 .. 
 
ω =  .  ∈ Rd+1 .
(4.1)
 xd 
1
As in quantum theory, each possible outcome of a measurement in a GPT is associated to an
effect. The set of all effects in a GPT system is known as its effect space which will generally
be denoted by E. The effect space E also corresponds to a convex subset of Rd+1 . Given a state
space S every effect e ∈ E must satisfy 0 ⩽ e · ω ⩽ 1 for all ω ∈ S, since this number defines
the probability of observing outcome e after performing a suitable measurement on a system
in state ω ∈ S. The effect space necessarily contains the zero and unit vectors,
 
 
0
0
 .. 
 .. 
 
 
0 = .
and
u = .,
(4.2)
 0
 0
0
1
as well as the vector (u − e) for every e ∈ E , which arises automatically as a valid effect. The
effect space also spans the full (d + 1) dimensions of the vector space.
Observables (or meters [39]) are
∑ given by maps E : ΩE → E from a countable outcome
set ΩE = {1, 2, . . .} ⊆ N such that x∈ΩE E(x) = u. An observable is often identified with its
(ordered) image, a tuple [[e1 , e2 , . . .]] of effects that sum to the unit effect u, such that each
effect in the tuple represents a different possible outcome when measuring the observable.
In addition to the effect space, a GPT should specify the set of observables. Any valid set of
observables contains all the couples [[e, u − e]], along with the observables that are thereby
simulable [39, 40] by means of taking classical mixtures of measurement procedures and
post-processings of outcomes. The results in this paper are valid for all choices of sets of
observables.
The no-restriction hypothesis states that given a state space S the effect space should comprise all possible effects, i.e. E should be equal to the set
{
}
E (S) = e ∈ Rd+1 |0 ⩽ e · ω ⩽ 1, for all ω ∈ S .
(4.3)
Analogously, given an effect space E the no-state-restriction hypothesis says that the state
space should contain all mathematically reasonable states, i.e. should be given by the set
{
}
W(E) = ω ∈ Rd+1 |ω · e ⩽ 1for all e ∈ E and ω · u = 1 .
(4.4)
We will not assume either no-restriction hypothesis, however, we will find the maps in
equations (4.3) and (4.4) very useful. For example, we will require the following result
from [5].

Figure 1. The bit state space SB and effect spaces EB , ENB and EaB of the classical bit,

NU bit and aNU bit, respectively.
Lemma 3. For any GPT with state space S, we have W (E (S)) = S.

We now give some simple examples of GPT systems: the classical-bit GPT, the noisy unrestricted (NU) bit and the almost noisy unrestricted (aNU) bit from [5], depicted in figure 1. All three
systems have state space, SB given by the line segment from (−1, 1)T to (1, 1)T . The classicalbit has effect space, EB = E(SB ), given by the square with vertices 0, u and e± = (±1/2, 1/2)T .
In the NU bit effect space the extremal points e± are replaced by scaled down versions pe± and
their complements u − pe± for some√
0 < p < 1. The aNU bit has effect space, EaB , given by the
intersection of two discs of radius 1/ 2 centred at (±1/2, 1/2)T . These examples demonstrate
how the dual statement to lemma 3 (E(W(E)) = E) does not hold in general, since
E(W(ENB )) = E(W(EaB )) = EB ,

(4.5)

but neither ENB nor EaB are equal to EB .
The NU bit is an example of a NU GPT system, whereby the positive cone of the effect space
is equal to the positive cone9 of the unrestricted effect space, i.e. E + = E(S)+ . Equivalently,
for every e ∈ E(S) there exists 0 < p ⩽ 1 such that pe ∈ E. The aNU bit does not satisfy this
property but instead is an almost NU GPT system whereby the closure of the positive cone of
the effect space is equal to the positive cone of the unrestricted effect space, i.e. E + = E(S)+ .
The class of aNU GPTs (including NU and unrestricted GPTs) is exactly the class of GPTs
satisfying the no-state-restriction hypothesis [5].
In this work will also require a few fundamental concepts from convex analysis. For a more
detailed introduction see, e.g. [41, 42].
Definition 9. A closed half-space of Rd is a set of vectors x ∈ Rd satisfying h · x ⩽ m for some

0 ̸= h ∈ Rd and m ∈ R.

A supporting hyperplane of a convex set, S, is the boundary of a closed half-space containing
the set which also intersects the closure, S, of the set.

For more details on the significance of cones in GPTs see [20].
10

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

Definition 10. A supporting hyperplane H of a convex set S in Rd is a set of points x ∈

Rd satisfying h · x = m for some 0 ̸= h ∈ Rd and m ∈ R such that h · s ⩽ m for all s ∈ S
and H ∩ S ̸= ∅.
This intersection of the set with a supporting hyperplane constitutes an exposed face. An
exposed face could be a point, a line segment or any other convex set. We define the dimension
of a convex set via its affine hull.
Definition 11. The affine hull of a subset S ⊆ Rd is the set of points x = λ1 s1 + . . . + λn sn for

real coefficients λj such that λ1 + . . . + λn = 1 and s1 , . . . , sn ∈ S.

Now, we define the dimension of a convex set as the dimension of its affine hull. When an
exposed face has dimension zero, i.e. is a point, we call this point an exposed
∑ point. Every
exposed point x is extremal (i.e. x cannot be written as a convex combination j pj xj of other
points from the set where 0 < pj < 1 for all j) but not every extremal point is exposed. The
exposed points are, however, a dense subset of the extremal points.
Finally, the relative interior, relint(S), of a convex set S is the interior of the set S when S
is viewed as a subset of its affine hull.
Definition 12. The relative interior, relint(S), of a convex set S is the set of x ∈ S such that for

all y ∈ S there exists λ > 1 such that λx + (1 − λ)y ∈ S.

5. GPTs satisfying intermediate determinism
In sections 3.1 and 3.2 we investigated how the intermediate determinism of quantum theory
followed from the structure of properties (in dimensions greater than two) and effects. GPTs,
on the other hand, may not even satisfy the principle of intermediate determinism, much less
the stronger requirement that intermediate determinism be guaranteed by the effect space. For
example, in the aNU bit system in section 4, the actual set of every state is simply the unit
effect, thus none of the states have a unique actual set. In this section we show our main result,
theorem 1, which states necessary and sufficient conditions for a GPT to satisfy intermediate
determinism. In section 7 we identify the subset of these GPTs in which intermediate determinism is a consequence of the effect space structure.
Given a GPT system with state space S and effect space E, the actual set Aω of a state
ω ∈ S is given by Aω = {e ∈ E|e · ω = 1}. A GPT satisfies intermediate determinism if each
of its pure states (extremal points of its state spaces) can be uniquely identified by their sets of
actual sets.
Definition 13. A GPT satisfies intermediate determinism if and if only for each system with
state space S we have: for all pure states ω ∈ S, Aω ′ = Aω implies ω ′ = ω for all ω ′ ∈ S.

We often consider GPT systems independently of their broader theory, in which case we will
say the system satisfies intermediate determinism if each of its pure states can be uniquely
identified by its actual effects. We will also sometimes need to consider the subset of the
unrestricted effect space, E(S), that gives probability one for a given state ω ∈ S, in which
case we will use the notation
AEω(S) = {e ∈ E(S)|e · ω = 1} .

(5.1)

To identify GPTs satisfying intermediate determinism, the exposed faces of GPT effect and
state spaces will be important. In particular, we require the following two definitions.
11

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

Definition 14. An actual face of a GPT effect space E is an exposed face F ⊂ E containing

the unit effect u that is maximal, in the sense that there does not exist an exposed face F ′ of E
such that F ⊊ F ′ .

For example, in figure 1 the line connecting e− and u is an actual face of EB whereas the point
u is not. However, u is an actual face of EaB since it is not contained in a larger exposed face.
Definition 15. A minimal exposed face of a convex set is an exposed face M such that M ∩ N
either equals M or the empty set, for all exposed faces N of the convex set.

See figure 3 for examples. We can now state the characterisation of GPTs satisfying intermediate determinism.
Theorem 1. A GPT satisfies intermediate determinism if and only if for each of its systems we

have
(a) for any pair of distinct actual faces F and F′ of E(S), we have F ∩ E ⊈ F ′ ∩ E, and
(b) every extremal point of S is exposed.
where S and E are the state and effects spaces of the system, respectively.
The proof of this result will centre around the bijection between the minimal exposed faces
of S and the actual faces of E(S). To establish this relationship we give the following series
of lemmata, with proofs in appendix B. Firstly, we find that for every exposed face of a state
space S there is a point of E(S) which only appears in the actual sets of points in that face.
Lemma 4. For every exposed face G of S there exists an element f of E(S) such that G =
{ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1}.

Conversely, we also find that every exposed face of an effect space E that contains the unit
effect is the actual set of some point ω ∈ W(E).
Lemma 5. For every exposed face F of E containing the unit effect there exists a vector ω ∈

W(E) such that F = {e ∈ E|e · ω = 1}.

Note that setting E = E(S) for any GPT state space S in the lemma above gives that for every
exposed face F of E(S) containing the unit effect there exists a vector ω ∈ W(E(S)) = S (by
lemma 3) such that F = {e ∈ E|e · ω = 1}.
Now, we find that the actual set (in E(S)) of every point in a given minimal exposed face
of S is an actual face of E(S).
Lemma 6. Given a minimal exposed face M of S there exists an actual face F of E(S) such

that
(a) F = {e ∈ E(S)|e · ω = 1for all ω ∈ M}, and
E(S)
(b) F = Aω for all ω ∈ M.
Next, we show that every actual face of E(S) is an actual set for some minimal exposed face
of S. Thus, there is a bijection between the actual faces of E(S) and minimal exposed faces
of S.
Lemma 7. Given an actual face F of E(S) there exists a minimal exposed face M of S such
that e · ω = 1 for all e ∈ F and ω ∈ S if and only if ω ∈ M.
12

V J Wright

Finally, we require one more lemma about state spaces in which every extremal point is
exposed.
Lemma 8. If all the extremal points of a convex set are exposed then every minimal exposed

face of the set is a point.
We can now prove theorem 1.
Proof. First, consider a GPT in which the state space S and effect space E of each system
satisfy conditions (a) and (b). Let ω X be an extremal and hence exposed point of S. Then, by
E(S)
lemma 6 the actual set of ω X in E(S) is an actual face F, i.e. AωX = F. The actual set of ω X
E
in E is then AωX = F ∩ E. Consider a point ω ∈ S such that

AEω = AEωX .

(5.2)

∑N
Let ω = j pj ω j for some N ∈ N be a decomposition of ω as a convex combination of
extremal points of S. We then find that
AEω =

N
∩

AEωj ,

(5.3)

j

since e · ω = 1 if and only if e · ω j = 1 for all j. Since the extremal states ω j are also exposed
we find that their actual sets in E(S) are given by actual faces, F j , of E(S), respectively. Then
equations (5.2) and (5.3) give
F ∩ E = AEωX = AEω =

N
∩

AEωj

j

=

N
∩

Fj ∩ E .

(5.4)

j

Thus, we have F ∩ E ⊆ Fj ∩ E for all 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N and by condition (a) this implies Fj = F. It then
follows from lemmata 8 and 7 that ω j = ω X for all 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N. Thus, we find ω = ω X and the
GPT satisfies intermediate determinism.
Second, consider a system of a GPT satisfying intermediate determinism with state space S
and effect space E. Let ω X be an extremal point of S. To begin, we will show that ω X must be
a member of a minimal exposed face of S. Suppose, to the contrary, that ω X is not contained
in some minimal exposed face M of S. Explicitly, let M ′ be the intersection of all the exposed
faces of S containing ω X and suppose M ′ strictly contains some minimal exposed face M ̸∋ ω X .
Let F be the subset of E(S) giving probability one for all states in M ′ , i.e. F ′ = {e ∈ E(S)|e ·
E(S)
/ F ′ such that f · ω X =
ω = 1for all ω ∈ M ′ }. We will show F ′ = AωX . Assume there exists f ∈
′′
′′
′
′
1. Then, M = {ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1} satisfies M ∩ M ̸= M contradicting the definition of M ′ .
Now, by lemma 6 the states of the minimal exposed face M ⊊ M ′ all share an actual set
consisting of an actual face F of E(S). Since M ⊊ M ′ we have F ′ ⊊ F. Now consider an equal
mixture ω ′ of ω X with a vector ω M of M. The actual set of this mixture is also F ′ and hence
ω X would be an extremal state without a unique actual set.
We have shown that each extremal point ω X of S must be a member of a minimal exposed
face, M. We will now show that ω X must itself be a minimal exposed face, i.e. we will show
E(S)
condition (b) to hold. By lemma 6, the actual set AωX in E(S) is an actual face and we have

Lemma 6 tells us that Aω = AωX . Therefore, we find
E(S)

AEω = AEω(S) ∩ E = AEω(S)
∩ E = AEωX ,

(5.5)

and thus, ω = ω X by the intermediate determinism of the GPT. Thus, condition (b) must hold.
Finally, combining lemma 7 with condition (b) we find that given a pair of actual faces F
and F ′ of E(S) there exists a pair of extremal points ω and ω ′ of S such that F and F ′ are the
actual sets of ω and ω ′ in E(S), respectively. Suppose F ∩ E ⊆ F ′ ∩ E and let ω m be an equal
mixture of ω and ω ′ . Then, AEω = F ∩ E = AEωm and the intermediate determinism of the GPT
gives ω m = ω = ω ′ . Thus, we find F = F ′ and condition (a) holds.
6. Examples of GPTs satisfying and violating intermediate determinism
In this section we describe the relationship between intermediate determinism, the norestriction hypothesis and Gleason-type theorems in GPTs. The relationship is summarised
pictorially in figure 2.
The two conditions (a) and (b) of theorem 1 together are neither necessary nor sufficient
for a GPT to satisfy the no-restriction hypothesis or admit a Gleason-type theorem. We say
a GPT admits a Gleason-type theorem when for each system every generalised probability
measure on the effect space is given by the inner product with a point in the state space. This
condition is equivalent to S = W(E) [5, 29], where S and E are the state and effect spaces of
the system, respectively. In terms of restrictions on the unrestricted effect space E(S), a GPT
system has a Gleason-type theorem if and only if the restriction is almost noisy, explicitly when
the effect space satisfies E + = E(S)+ . Satisfying the no-restriction hypothesis is sufficient but
not necessary for a GPT to admit a Gleason-type theorem.
Obeying the no-restriction hypothesis (E = E(S)) is also not sufficient for a GPT system
to satisfy intermediate determinism since a state space S could have extremal points that are
not exposed. A classic example of such a convex set is a ‘pill’ shape given by a square with
two semicircles attached to two opposite sides, as in figure 3. Explicitly, this set is the convex
hull of two arcs given by

Taking this convex subset of R3 to be the state space Sp and letting Ep = E(Sp ) ⊂ R3 be the
effect space results in a GPT system with a Gleason-type theorem, satisfying the no-restriction
hypothesis that does not satisfy intermediate determinism.
We can also find examples of GPT systems that violate the no-restriction hypothesis and
intermediate determinism but still have a Gleason-type theorem. The aNU bit system described
in section 4 and figure 1 is such a system.
In an almost NU GPT that is not a NU GPT, such as the aNU bit, the positive cone of the
effect space is not closed, i.e. E + ̸= E + . All such effect spaces have extremal effects arbitrarily
close to the zero and unit effects. Unlike the aNU bit, effect spaces of this type can be part of
GPTs satisfying intermediate determinism if the state spaces are restricted in the correct way.
For example, consider an effect space Eu in R3 given by the convex hull of the zero and unit

Figure 4. Depiction of the state space Sa , the effect space Eu and an almost noisy restric-

tion Ea that satisfies intermediate determinism. Diagrams (a), (c) and (d) show a ‘bird’seye’ view where the z-axis is normal to the page. Diagram (a) shows the effect space Ea as
a restriction of polyhedral effect space Eu given by the convex hull of the eight effects e1
to e8 and the zero and unit effects. In the restricted effect space E a the extremal points
e3 and e7 are discarded and replaced by continuous arcs of extremal points (blue). A
cross-section of the effect space along the plane containing e3 , e7 and u is shown in (b).
Diagram (c) shows the state space Sa compared to the unrestricted state space W(Ea ).
Finally, diagram (d) shows the effect space Ea compared to the unrestricted effect space
E(Sa ), where the four shaded red triangles indicate the intersections of each of the four
actual faces of E(Sa ) with Ea .

Now Ea together with the unrestricted state space W(Ea ) = W(Eu ) shown in figure 4(c) does
not satisfy intermediate determinism. For example, the extremal point ω of W(Ea ) has an
actual set Aω given by the convex hull of e2 and u depicted by the red line in figure 4(a).
However, all the states in the face of W(Ea ) highlighted by the red line in figure 4(c)
(minus the other end point) also have the same actual set Aω . On the other hand, the state
ω would have actual set given by the convex hull of e2 , e3 and u in the unrestricted effect
space Eu .
Out of the eight extremal points of W(Ea ), four have the problem of no longer begin
propensity functions. However, we may remove them without introducing any further
extremal points (or reducing the dimension of the state space) by taking the convex
hull of the four propensity functions, resulting in the restricted state space Sa shown in
figure 4(c).

The pair Ea and Sa exhibit intermediate determinism since they satisfy requirements (a) and
(b) of theorem 1. In particular, in figure 4(d) we see how the intersection of each of the four
actual faces of E(Sa ) with Ea is a distinct actual face of Ea .
We conclude this section by noting that if all the extremal points of a GPT’s state spaces are
exposed then the no-restriction hypothesis is sufficient to ensure that intermediate determinism
holds, as is being a NU GPT. This statement is a corollary of theorem 1.
Corollary 1. A noisy unrestricted GPT in which all the extremal points of the state spaces are

exposed obeys intermediate determinism.
Proof. We need to show that in a NU GPT system with state space S and effect space E
satisfy condition (a) of theorem 1. Let F and F ′ be two distinct actual faces of E(S). Then,
given e ∈ F/F ′ we have that p(u − e) ∈ E for some 0 < p ⩽ 1 and thus, ep = u − p(u − e) =
pe − (1 − p)u ∈ E. Let ω be a state for which F ′ is the actual set, i.e. f · ω = 1 for all f ∈ F ′ .
The effect ep is clearly in F however, cannot be in F ′ since this would require e · ω = 1 and
therefore, e ∈ F ′ .

It follows that most of the GPTs in the literature satisfy intermediate determinism, such as
all the polytope systems from [43]. However, being a NU GPT is not necessary, for example
the convexification [22] of the Spekkens’ toy theory [44] is not a NU GPT but does obey
intermediate determinism.
7. Intermediate determinism from effect space structure
Now we have established exactly which GPTs satisfy the principle of intermediate determinism, we can also identify in which GPTs intermediate determinism is guaranteed by the
structure of the effect space, as is the case with quantum theory. This property is necessary if
one wishes to have an axiomatisation of a theory in which pure states are propensity functions.
Recall the example of the qubit lattice of properties. Here we said that although the system
satisfies intermediate determinism, in the sense that each pure state has a unique actual set,
this fact is not guaranteed by the property lattice. Explicitly, for every pure state there exist
other generalised probability measures (not given by density operators) with the same actual
set. Thus, there exist no propensity functions on this lattice. In particular, the pure states of a
qubit are not propensity functions on its lattice of properties.
On the other hand, we found that the pure states of a qubit were propensity functions on the
qubit effect space. Therefore, assuming the effect space structure there is no other theoretically
possible state with the same set of actual properties as any given pure state. Thus, we say the
effect space structure guarantees the intermediate determinism of the qubit. We now define
generalised probability measures and propensity functions on a GPT effect space in order to
identify in which GPTs the pure states are propensity functions on the effect spaces.
The following definition of a generalised probability measure on a GPT effect space coincides with definition 7 for quantum effects when the set of quantum effects is viewed as a GPT
effect space. The definition is also a special case of definition 19.
Definition 16. A generalised probability measure v on a GPT effect space E is a map v : E →

[0, 1] satisfying
v(e + f + . . .) = 1

(7.1)

for all sequences of effects (e, f, . . .) ⊂ E such that [[e, f, . . .]] is an observable.
17

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

It was shown in [5] that for any GPT effect space and any set of observables every generalised
probability measure v can be expressed as v(e) = e · ω for some ω ∈ W(E).
We can similarly generalise the notion of an actual set to a generalised probability measure, v, on a GPT effect space, as the set of effects, Av = {e ∈ E|v(e) = 1}, which occur with
certainty when the system is in a state with generalised probability measure v.
Now, we define a propensity function as a generalised probability measure that is uniquely
identified by its actual set.
Definition 17. A propensity function on a GPT effect space E is a generalised probability

measure v on E such that Av = Av ′ implies v = v ′ for all generalised probability measures v′
on E.

Thus, if the extremal states in a GPT system are propensity functions on the effect space there
cannot exist other generalised probability measures with the same actual set.
Definition 18. The effect space of a GPT system guarantees intermediate determinism if and
only if the pure states of the system are propensity functions on the effect space.

In general, the set of generalised probability measures can strictly contain the state space.
Therefore, all pure states being propensity functions is a stronger statement than the GPT
satisfying intermediate determinism, whereby all pure states must have a unique actual set
amongst all the states in the state space but not necessarily amongst the larger set of generalised
probability measures.
For example, consider the state space S⋄ depicted in figure 3 which is a restriction of the
pill shaped state space, Sp , along with the unrestricted effect space E(Sp ) of Sp . The pair S⋄
and E(Sp ) satisfy intermediate determinism but the top extremal point, ω t , is not a propensity
function. The section of the boundary marked in red, of which ω t is the midpoint, is a minimal
exposed face of Sp and thus, by lemma 6, all the points in this face have the same actual set
in E(Sp ).
The propensity functions on an effect space are given by the points of W(E) whose actual
set is an actual face of E. This fact can be seen from lemma 5 and the fact that the actual set
of any state in W(E) is an exposed face of E containing u. It follows from lemmata 6 and 7
that all the propensity functions will be exposed points of W(E) but not all exposed points are
propensity functions. Therefore, in order for intermediate determinism to be guaranteed by the
effect space structure we need that the extremal points of the state space S are a subset of the
exposed points of W(E) with actual sets given by actual faces of E. More precisely:
Corollary 2. All the extremal states of a GPT system are propensity functions if and only if
they are a subset of the (exposed) points of W(E) whose actual sets are actual faces of the
effect space of the system.

8. Properties in GPTs
Propensity functions were originally introduced to represent states that are completely characterised by their actual properties. In sections 3.2 and 7 we generalised propensity functions
to act on quantum/GPT effect spaces. In this setting propensity functions represent states that
are completely characterised by their actual effects. Effects are generally not interpreted as
representing properties of a quantum system. For example, as discussed earlier, effects do not
form a lattice.

V J Wright

The advantage of generalising propensity functions and intermediate determinism to effects
is that they now exist for two-level quantum systems. The disadvantage is that the possibility for deriving quantum and classical theories using the result of Piron (as summarised in
section 2) is lost. In this section, we give a brief proposal for the introduction of properties
in the GPT framework. Under this proposal one can simultaneously consider intermediate
determinism for effects and properties, thus combining the advantages of both perspectives11 .
We propose postulating that the properties of a GPT system be given by the extremal points
of the effect space. In the case of quantum theory this postulate recovers the property lattice
P(H) [46]. In general, the extremal effects are endowed with a natural partial order given by
e ⩽ f if f − e ∈ E + . This partial order is compatible with the interpretation that if e ⩽ f and e
is actual then so is f .
We may then use the ideas of the present manuscript to continue following the path laid out
by Gisin to try single out quantum theory, but without ruling out two-level quantum systems.
Namely, we can combine three requirements on GPT effect spaces where properties are given
by the extremal effects: (a) properties form a complete orthomodular lattice, (b) states are generalised probability measures on effect spaces and pure states are those generalised probability
measure that restrict to propensity functions on the properties and (c) every (non-zero) property is an actual property of some state. Note that requirements (a) and (c) follow those of
Gisin and only (b) has been modified.
In this setting we can ask whether there exist complete orthomodular lattices of GPT properties satisfying intermediate determinism besides the quantum and classical cases, or subtheories thereof. This question may be easier to answer than its counterpart for general property
lattices, which was left as an open problem by Gisin. We can also investigate how the characteristics of a GPT property lattice translate into features of the effect space, and vice versa. For
example, in which effect spaces would the extremal effects form a lattice satisfying the covering law? And what does an effect space being an almost noisy restriction (satisfying E + ̸= E + )
mean for the structure of extremal effects?
9. Discussion
In this work we have generalised the idea of intermediate determinism from properties to
measurement events. Under this generalisation we have found that the propensity functions
on quantum effect spaces are given by the Born rule given some pure quantum state. In our
main result, theorem 1, we have identified exactly which GPTs satisfy intermediate determinism. Then, in corollary 2, we have found when the pure states of a GPT system are given by
propensity functions and intermediate determinism is guaranteed.
In future work the author wishes to explore introducing the idea of properties into the GPT
framework, as proposed in section 8. The results of this manuscript could then be used to
attempt to single out quantum theory using the method proposed by Gisin [1] without ruling
out quantum systems in dimension two. As suggested in section 8, one candidate for properties
that recovers the property lattice P(H) from the quantum effect space is the set of extremal
effects. Alternatively, in this work the exposed faces of the effect spaces were shown to play
an important role in intermediate determinism. These faces are an appealing candidate since
the exposed faces of any convex set naturally form a complete lattice.
Introducing properties to GPTs will also open up questions such as, whether there exist
complete orthomodular lattices of GPT properties satisfying intermediate determinism, or the
11

Note that propositional and operational frameworks have been combined previously [45].

covering law, other than those of classical and quantum physics. Answering these questions
will, in turn, shed light on the open question of whether there exist property lattices outside
classical and quantum physics satisfying the axioms of Gisin.

Appendix A. A structure for generalised probability measures
In this appendix we give a definition of a generalised probability measure on a general structure. Our definition coincides with the definitions of a generalised probability measures on a
orthomodular lattices, quantum effect spaces and GPT effect spaces given in definitions 1, 3, 7
and 16.
Let (M, ⊕) be a partial commutative monoid, with an element u such that u ⊕ m is defined
if and only if m = 0 where zero is the identity element of the operation ⊕. Explicitly, M is a
set with a partial binary operation ⊕ such that:
(a) if m ⊕ n is defined then n ⊕ m is defined and m ⊕ n = n ⊕ m;
(b) if (m ⊕ n) ⊕ o is defined then m ⊕ (n ⊕ o) is defined and we denote m ⊕ n ⊕ o := m ⊕ (n ⊕
o) = (m ⊕ n) ⊕ o;
(c) there exists an identity element 0 ∈ M such that 0 + m = m for all m ∈ M;
(d) there exists an element u ∈ M such that u ⊕ m is defined if and only if m = 0.
⊕∞
⊕N
Additionally, we say that j=1 mj is defined if j=1 mj for all N ∈ N. The existence of
m ⊕ n generalises the idea of m and n being jointly measurable as effects or orthogonal as
properties.
Definition 19. A generalised probability measure v on (M, ⊕) is a map v : M → [0, 1] such that

(a) for any sequence (mj ) such that
(b) v(u) = 1.

⊕∞

j=1 mj

is defined, we have v(

⊕∞

j=1 mj )

=

∑∞

j=1 v(mj ), and

If M forms a complete orthomodular lattice, we take the partial operation ⊕ to be the least
upper bound operation restricted to elements a, b such that a < bc . For quantum and GPT
effect spaces we take ⊕ to be the standard addition operation, restricted to pairs of effects that
sum to an effect. Under these mappings the definitions of a generalised probability measure
coincide with definitions 1, 3, 7 and
⊕∞16. The only non-immediate aspect to verifying this fact
is showing that the infinite sum j=1 mj can be defined as we would wish in the lattices/effect spaces. For example, in a quantum effect space we will demonstrate that the infinite sum

j=1 Ej is defined exactly when
j=1 Ej weakly converges to an effect, and therefore tak⊕∞
∑N
ing j=1 Ej = w− limN→∞ j=1 Ej is well-defined, where w− lim is the weak limit.
∑N
Let (Ej ) be a sequence of effects in E(H) such that SN = j=1 Ej ⩽ E ∈ E(H) for all N ∈ N.

Then we have (SN ) is increasing and bounded above therefore (for example, by theorem 2.7
in [47]), the set {SN |N ∈ N} has a least upper bound
∑∞ S to which (SN ) weakly converges. Since
E is an upper bound of {SN |N ∈ N}, we find j=1 Ej = S ⩽ E is an effect. For the converse,
∑N
clearly if (Ej ) is a sequence of effects in E(H) such that j=1 Ej weakly converges to an effect
∑N
then j=1 Ej ∈ E(H) for all N ∈ N.
Appendix B. Proofs of lemmata 4–8
Lemma 4. For every exposed face G of S there exists an element f of E(S) such that

G = {ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1}.

Proof. Firstly, if G = S then we may take f = u ∈ E(S).

Otherwise, given a state space S embedded in Rd+1 , let Sd denote the d-dimensional state
space before the embedding. Explicitly,
S = {(x1 , . . . , xd , 1)T |(x1 , . . . , xd )T ∈ Sd }.

(B.1)

Let H d be the supporting hyperplane of Sd ⊂ Rd intersecting Sd at the exposed face Gd . Then
we may describe H d as the set of vectors yd ∈ Rd such that
hd · yd = m,

(B.2)

for some vector hd = (h1 , h2 , . . . , hd )T ∈ Rd and real number m ∈ R, chosen such that hd ·
ω d ⩽ m for all ω d ∈ Sd . Now, letting h = hd ⊕ (1 − m) ∈ Rd+1 and y = yd ⊕ 1 ∈ Rd+1 ,
equation (B.2) may be equivalently written as
h · y = 1,

(B.3)

and h · ω ⩽ 1 for all ω ∈ S.
Finally, let l = minω∈S h · ω. If l ⩾ 0, setting f = h gives f ∈ E(S) and {ω ∈ S| f · ω =
1} = G. If l < 0 we may mix h with the unit effect to bring its minimum value on S to zero
whilst preserving the equation (B.3). Explicitly, set
f=

l
1
u+
h.
l−1
1−l

(B.4)

Now, similarly the vector f ∈ Rd+1 satisfies f ∈ E(S) and {ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1} = G.
Lemma 5. For every exposed face F of E containing the unit effect there exists a vector ω ∈

W(E) such that F = {e ∈ E|e · ω = 1}.

Proof. Let H = {e ∈ E|e · h = x} be a supporting hyperplane of E intersecting E at F, where

h ∈ Rd+1 and x ∈ R.
Firstly, we will show that x ̸= 0 since E must span Rd+1 and contain u − e for each e it
contains. Assume x = 0 and, w.l.o.g. h · e ⩾ 0 for all e ∈ E. Then, since for each e ∈ E we have
u − e ∈ E we find h · (u − e) ⩾ 0 and therefore, h · e ⩽ 0. Thus, we have that h · e = 0 for all
e ∈ E meaning E could not span Rd+1 .
21

J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 464002

V J Wright

Since x ̸= 0 we may define ω = h/x. We find if e ∈ H then e · ω = 1. It follows that u · ω = 1
since u ∈ F ∈ H. Finally, we also have e · ω ⩽ 1 for all e ∈ E. In turn this gives (u − e) · ω ⩽ 1
and thus, e · ω ⩾ 0 for all e ∈ E(S). Therefore, we have ω ∈ W(E).
Lemma 6. Given a minimal exposed face M of S there exists an actual face F of E(S) such

that
(a) F = {e ∈ E(S)|e · ω = 1for all ω ∈ M}, and
E(S)
(b) F = Aω for all ω ∈ M.
Proof. For Statement (a), let M be a minimal exposed face of S. Then there exists
f ∈ E(S) such that M = {ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1} by lemma 4. Let m ∈ relint(M) and F = {e ∈
E(S)|e·m = 1}. The set F is an exposed face of E(S) contained u, now we must show that
it is maximal.
Let F ′ be the actual face containing F and f ′ ∈ relint(F ′ ). Then we define M ′ = {ω ∈ S| f ′ ·
ω = 1}. We will show M ′ = M. Let ω ′ ∈ M ′ then, by definition, we have f ′ · ω ′ = 1. Now,
since f ′ is in the relative interior of F ′ we have that e · ω ′ = 1 for all e ∈ F ′ including f · ω = 1.
By the definition of M it follows that ω ′ ∈ M and we can conclude that M ′ ⊆ M. However, M ′
is an exposed face of S and M is minimal therefore we have M ′ = M.
Finally, given e ∈ F ′ we have e · m = 1 since m ∈ relint(M) = relint(M ′ ). Thus, by the
definition of F we also have e ∈ F and thus, F ′ ⊆ F. Since, conversely, F ⊆ F ′ by the definition
of F ′ , we have that F = F ′ is an actual face of E(S).
E(S)
For Statement (b), let ω ∈ M. Then Aω is an exposed face of E(S) containing F, since
E(S)
e · ω = 1 for all e ∈ F. Then it follows from the actuality of F that F = Aω .
Lemma 7. Given an actual face F of E(S) there exists a minimal exposed face M of S such
that e · ω = 1 for all e ∈ F and ω ∈ S if and only if ω ∈ M.
Proof. By lemma 5 (see the note below the lemma), there exists ω̃ ∈ S such that F is the
E(S)

actual set of ω̃ (in E(S)), i.e. F = Aω̃ = {e ∈ E(S)|e · ω̃ = 1}. Let f ∈ relint(F). Then we
have f · ω̃ = 1 and f · ω ⩽ 1 for all ω ∈ S. Thus, f defines a supporting hyperplane of S, intersecting at a non-empty exposed face M = {ω ∈ S| f · ω = 1} ∋ ω̃. It follows that M satisfies
the necessary and sufficient condition from the lemma as follows. If ω ∈ M then f · ω = 1.
Then since f ∈ relint F we have e · ω = 1 for all e ∈ F. Conversely, if e · ω = 1 for all e ∈ F,
we have that f · ω = 1 and thus, ω ∈ M.
We will now show that the exposed face M is minimal. Suppose M is not minimal. Then
there exists an exposed face M ′ ⊂ M. By lemma 4, there exists f ′ ∈ E(S) such that M ′ =
{ω ∈ S| f ′ · ω = 1}. Let m ∈ M \ M ′ . Then f ′ · m < 1 which implies that f ′ ∈
/ F since m ∈ M.
E(S)
On the other hand, let ω ′ ∈ M ′ , and F ′ = Aω ′ = {e ∈ E(S)|e · ω ′ = 1}. Since ω ′ ∈ M we
have that F ⊆ F ′ . However, we also have that f ′ ∈ F ′ . Thus, F ′ is an exposed face of E(S)
strictly containing F and contradicting the maximality of F.
Lemma 8. If all the extremal points of a convex set are exposed then every minimal exposed

face of the set is a point.
Proof. Let S be a convex set in which all extremal points are exposed. Consider a minimal
∑N
exposed face M containing a point ω. Let ω = j=1 pj ω j be a convex decomposition of ω
where ω j are extremal points of S for 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N. Any exposed face containing ω also contains
the points ω j , however since ω j are exposed and M is minimal we find ω j = ω for all 1 ⩽ j ⩽ N
and ω is an exposed point of S.

BEYOND WISHFUL THINKING: RECONCILING FAITH
AND SCIENCE IN CRISES OF HOPE
by John N. Constantino

and W. Thomas Baumel

Abstract.
Steady advances in neuroscience have shaped understanding of brain and mind, in ways that challenge spiritual belief and
can amplify misconceptions about biological determinism. The inability to reconcile spirituality and science risks faith being construed
as “out of touch” with reality, and in worst-case scenarios engendering
clinical-level crises of hope. The latter typically involve three central
issues: the free will problem, desperate perceptions about mortality,
and the constraint of individual identity. Here, we synthesize contemporary scientific and philosophical understanding to propose a
reconciliation of faith and science of particular relevance to preservation of hope. In this approach, we review the compatibility of natural
causation and human freedom, parameterize “meaning” on the basis
of specific opportunities for decision-making within the timeframe
of a lifetime, and articulate a model of self-transcendence predicated
on these principles and on observed characteristics of human love.
This model resides within “common ground” for faith and science
by avoiding unnecessary dichotomization of the material and the
Divine.

compatibilism; determinism; existential conflict; free
will; identity; meaning; neuroscience; psychiatry; self-transcendence;

Introduction
The prisoner who had lost faith in the future…was doomed. With his loss
of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline
and became subject to mental and physical decay.

Existential crises precipitated or aggravated by the collapse of faith-based
mental frameworks are common contributors to depressive states (Hacker
1994; Baumel and Constantino 2020; Mosqueiro et al., 2021). These
crises can arise from conflicts between assumptions embedded in spiritual
formation and the recognition of physical realities that cannot be reconciled with those assumptions. Historically, loss of close loved ones and the
prospect of mortality have been two of the classic precipitants of depressive crises, but in recent years widely disseminated advances in science—
particularly in the domains of genome, brain, and behavioral sciences—
have intensified the burden of reconciling spirituality and science. Direct
implications of contemporary models of human consciousness and the
predictability of mental phenomena can be misunderstood to imply that
spiritual belief is misguided, or that there exist such pronounced biological
constraints on individual freedom that it is not possible to live a meaningful life. Either of these perspectives can engender hopelessness, which is a
correlate of clinical depression and one of the most potent predictors of
suicidal thinking and behavior (Schafer et al., 2020; Tsujii et al., 2020;
Gray et al., 2021).
Our purpose in this article is to address the scholarly reconciliation of
spirituality and science through a distinct clinical lens, by focusing on elements that are of particular salience to crises of hope. Typically, in scenarios
of hopelessness, existential conflicts arising from failure to reconcile faith
and science relate to one or more of three major issues: (1) the free will
problem, (2) the implications of mortality, and/or (3) the constraint of
individual identity. To our knowledge, there are no single-source writings
that have covered this constellation of issues in accordance with contemporary knowledge in philosophy and life sciences. Updated appraisal of
consistencies between spirituality and science are extremely important in
religious formation, in the care and support of people who are perplexed
or in crisis on the basis of new understanding in either sphere, and in the
promotion of resilience among individuals who have experienced significant adverse life events.
Resolution of existential concerns evoked by faith/science conundrums
are relevant to all people (Doeselaar et al., 2018), because perceptions
about individual freedom, the consequences of mortality, and the maturation of identity are deeply embedded in many critical aspects of human
development, whether viewed from a philosophical, psychological, or
spiritual perspective. We first briefly review the developmental context
in which our approach to the reconciliation of spirituality and science is
proposed.

Figure 1. The architecture of social identity, reprinted from Baumel and Constantino
(2020). Schematic depiction of developmental milestones relevant to discovery of purpose/meaning and the capacity to resolve existential concerns. In this schema, identity in
childhood is principally derived from experience in dyadic family relationships. In adolescence, the context for identity shifts from the nuclear family to the larger social network,
and developmental acquisition of the capacity for self-reflection and formal operational
thinking prompt questions about one’s place in and value to society. Clinical resolution of
depression may be facilitated by specific attention to missed steps in identity formation, as
depicted here.

A Developmental Context for Reconciling Faith and
Science
A child’s mastery of the ability to form a human relationship is a bedrock
of social competence, and by extension, of identity, that is, the manner in
which he or she comes to define “self” as distinct from—while simultaneously connected to—“other.” Just as existential conflict challenges identity
and renders it fragile, secure relationships bolster identity. Successful relationships require the balancing of two seemingly opposed developmental
“forces”—the psychological drive to attach (i.e., achieve emotional connection) and the drive to separate (i.e., exercise autonomy)—in relation to
another human being (these are represented at the base of Figure 1). It is
the lived experience of successful integration of attachment and separation
(the essence of a prototypic human relationship) through which identity
matures (Constantino et al., 2002); Table 1 depicts this progression and
aligns it with the various terminologies that are used in describing moral
and psychological development, either from scientific, philosophical, or

The table is organized by domain of human development (moral, psychological, philosophical, spiritual) across the continuum of maturation-of-identity from that
exclusively defined in relation to self, to that principally defined in relation to all (see text for further details). It is important to note that disparate terminologies of the
respective scholarly traditions that address this developmental progression preserve important nuances of understanding, but also introduce language “disconnects” that can
confound efforts to reconcile spirituality and science across disciplines. Here, for the sake of clarity and emphasis, we have omitted breakdown by stages in the development
of cognition, which can affect the timing and acquisition of the milestones depicted in any given row.

religious perspectives (disconnects in the language used across disciplines
can present barriers to reconciliation of perspectives on faith and science).
We note that clinical disorders of relationship-relevant behavior, the personality disorders, can be traced to disruptions of either attachment (a
consequence to identity is lack of a sense of agency) or separation (a consequence of which is lack of the ability to cooperate) (Cloninger et al.,
1993; Svrakic et al., 1993). Stressors that overwhelm the psychological defenses at a given stage of maturation commonly result in loss of hope in
the ability to: (1) direct the course of one’s own life (i.e., feeling helpless, controlled, or out of control), (2) rely on the support of others (i.e.,
feeling marginalized or cheated out of opportunity), and/or (3) construct
a fulfilling existence in the timeframe of a limited lifetime (Baumel and
Constantino 2020).
Maturation of identity proceeds in adolescence along two axes. The first
is the psychological motivation to relate to a larger society (not just to a
single attachment figure as is the case for an infant’s dyadic relationship
with a primary caregiver). This involves steady progression from dyadic
to triadic relationships (Figure 1) in which connection and autonomy are
maintained for multiple parties simultaneously. The second is a specific
progression of cognitive development that occurs around the time of puberty: it involves new acquisition of the capacity for formal operational
thinking (e.g., abstraction, hypothesis-testing), and its implications for
predictive reasoning, anticipating, and planning for the future, and assimilation of wider circles of new knowledge about the world. This is now
also a time of accelerated exposure to information about self and the world
through social media and the internet.
It is during early adolescence that existential threats to autonomy/individuality become particularly prominent, in the form of concerns
about isolation, death, and meaninglessness (Hacker 2014; Baumel and
Constantino 2020). These are buffered by defense mechanisms (Table 1)
that are, at first, primitive and immature (e.g., denial and consequent risktaking behavior). In healthy development, immature defenses are gradually replaced by more mature ones that are characterized by a greater degree of recognition and acceptance of truths regarding self and other (see
Viorst 1998). For example, whereas suppression or acting out of negative
emotions occur in the setting of immature defenses, such emotions are
harnessed for a constructive purpose (sublimation) or transformed altogether through acts of altruism (i.e., toward others experiencing similar
hardship) in more mature individuals. An identity as both autonomous
and capable of sustaining meaningful connection to others is a developmental foundation of resilience and transcendence of self, as depicted in
Figure 1. Conflicts that emerge between faith and science—and that
evoke existential concerns about agency and mortality—can pose a

825

direct threat to identity whenever such difficult concerns overwhelm
an individual’s defense mechanisms.
It is also important to consider the manner in which perceived conflicts
between faith and science contribute to the absence of personal investment
in spirituality, or what has been observed as a progressive distancing of the
current generation of adolescents and young adults from initiating such
investment in the first place (Dinges 2018). This may be an unnecessary
loss, and the preservation of compelling options for spiritual formation
confer important prospects for resilience, buffering stress, and recovery (as
occurs in 12-step programs, see below) for all people. Individuals exposed
to some of the harshest aspects of reality—epitomized by Holocaust survivors described in the writings of Frankl (2006), who asserted that those
“who have a why to live can bear almost any how”—can ill afford to have
useful spiritual foundations compromised by unnecessary conflicts with
modern science.
In summary, a practical framework for reconciling faith and science—
one that is particularly accessible to adolescents and young adults—may
have a surprising array of potential applications, including innovations in
clinical intervention, religious formation, and support of the development
of identity, meaning, and resilience. All of these opportunities motivate
this particular synthesis of relevant literature in psychology, philosophy,
and neuroscience. We fully recognize that the scope of scholarly work on
the integration of religion and science is vast, as broadly covered in the
contents of this journal for over 50 years. We have chosen in this article to
focus on what we believe is most salient to the resolution or prevention of
clinical crises of hope among youth and young adults, and what might be
learned from this perspective for the broader enterprise.
We are not aware of any previously published resource that traces
hopelessness—when precipitated or aggravated by perceived conflicts between faith and science—to three critical issues: (1) underestimation of
the capacity for freedom of will; (2) underestimation of opportunity for
meaning or purpose (especially when mortality is more seriously perceived
as final); and (3) underestimation of implications of the phenomenon of
human love for practical constructs of spiritual identity. Many aspects of
free will, meaning, and love can be explored in greater detail in original,
at times more esoteric, works in philosophy, theology, and the sciences—
which we cite herein and to which readers of our article are referred for
additional reading. But this article has been motivated by the conviction
that a focused review in relation to crises of hope is of particular relevance,
to reverse a widening gap between faith and science, one that is particularly
(and at times literally) demoralizing to young people of faith.

The Nature of Faith–Science Conflicts in Existential
Crises
As stated in the introduction, conflicts between faith and science typically
precipitate existential crises when knowledge of science challenges previously held religious beliefs, or when such beliefs—having played an important developmental role in hope or identity—are subsequently lost. Faith
and science conflicts can arise in other directions (e.g., when faith broadens narrow perspectives of science or clinical practice) but these occurrences generally raise hope and are not threatening to identity. When faith
is challenged or compromised, and knowledge of the observable “here and
now” is all that can be relied upon to sustain hope and identity, the most
immediate implications are for free will, mortality, and identity. Concerns
about free will arise from reductionism in the interpretation of scientific understanding of brain function. The essential perspective is that
if all thinking and behavior can be traced to the function of neurobiological circuitry, and, in turn, the data encoded in these circuits can be
used to reliably predict outcomes, then we are machines at the mercy of
the cause-and-effect sequences of biological processes. Our approach to
this problem is to show how this perspective is rooted in a specific fallacy,
that predictability is incompatible with freedom. We will provide an updated appraisal of philosophical and biological understanding of compatibilism leveraging the respective contributions of philosophers John Perry
and Daniel Dennett, along with consideration of two key corollaries of the
free will problem: first, risks of invoking dualism and second, the relationship between free will and meaning (or “purpose”).
By definition, dualism places spirituality squarely “outside of the box”
of brain and biological function. In this article, we develop an integration
of science and spirituality that does not depend upon dualism or upon
any overt dichotomization of physical versus spiritual reality. This is not
to reject the notion that there exists an immaterial component of human
existence (a soul), rather to root this particular reconciliation of science
and spirituality in the common ground of the observable, particularly for
people in crisis. Of many challenges to dualism that have been rendered
over centuries of philosophical writing, one of the most accessible to scientists is that dualism violates the first law of thermodynamics (conservation
of mass and energy): if an immaterial agent were capable of interruption
or disruption of a physical (brain-based) process, conservation of mass and
energy would be violated. This is a “nonstarter” for people of science and
therefore we have chosen to avoid invoking dualism in this reconciliation
of science and spirituality. Although this may be a very difficult “loss” or
concession in some religious traditions, it averts trading one source of loss
of control for another—whether one is “controlled” by one’s brain or by a
spiritual entity over which there is no biological control, the scenarios are

potentially equally compromising of human autonomy. In what follows we
will address implications of contemporary models of human consciousness
that are consistent with an individual’s capacity to choose freely whether
or not one invokes the existence of spiritual influences divorced from the
physical world.
A corollary of the free will problem is that human meaning depends
critically upon the capacity to make choices, a position that that we and
others (William James 1910; Frankl 2006) have taken as a foundational
philosophical assumption. One of the remarkable scientific observations
of the twentieth century was that the phenomenon of clinical depression
could be biologically recapitulated in rodents in “learned helplessness” experiments in which the animals were forced to learn that they had no
choices in behavioral strategies to avoid aversive stimuli (e.g., foot shocks).
In humans, learned helplessness—to be distinguished from intentional relinquishing of choice as a matter of transcendence under conditions that
cannot be changed—is a potent inducer of depression. The relevance to
identity of whether one is free to make choices can hardly be overstated:
behavior differs radically under one assumption versus the other, and any
significant challenge to an assumption of freedom can precipitate serious
existential concerns.
Next is the issue of mortality. The problem is articulated in Shakespeare’s
Macbeth ([1606] 2021), that the inevitability of mortality drowns any possibility of meaning, even in the presence of free will:
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing
(William Shakespeare, Macbeth 5.5.23–27).

We will attempt to deconstruct such desperate perspectives on mortality
by considering the counterfactual, that is, the implications for meaning if
there were no such thing as mortality. We will present the view that mortality may actually reify opportunity for meaningful decision-making (in
our clinical experience this often comes as a surprise to patients in crisis),
including acts of personal heroism. In this article, we consider mortality
as inevitable and unconditional—we have no intention to dismiss possibilities for existential continuity following death (heaven) as espoused by
many major religions, we view this as unknowable and thereby outside-ofscope of reconciling science and faith.
A final clinical issue raised by unresolved conflicts between faith and
science is that of identity: this occurs particularly when a personal decision
to reject dualism (i.e., abandon the notion of an immaterial component of
human existence) is felt to be incompatible with spiritual identity. Here,

it is helpful to point out that in the clinical treatment of addictions, a
“higher power” is often invoked as a prerequisite for recovery (e.g., in 12step programs), but does not necessarily specify that it must be supernatural. A useful parameterization of higher power in this context includes, for
example, an enduring relationship with a trusted friend who is relied upon
for unconditional love and support.
In this article, we take the position that each of these problems arise
from broad underestimation of both human neurobiology and real-world
manifestations of spirituality, including the phenomenon of human love
(see Constantino 1991, 2001). Lack of personal experience with the latter can be a particularly potent constraint on recognizing manifestations
of spirituality in day-to-day life, as might occur for individuals who have
never been unconditionally loved, have undergone serious or overwhelming traumatic life events, or who are otherwise compromised in their capacity to engage in healthy human relationships.

Reconciling Faith and Science in Crises of Hope
Based upon the model of human development we have outlined above,
and the specific clinical consequences of unresolved conflict between faith
and science that we have summarized as context, we turn now to the contemporary literature in philosophy and cognitive neuroscience to address
the three key issues that lie at the interface: (1) we will first describe a
practical resolution of the free will problem on the basis of current scientific and philosophical perspectives on compatibilism; (2) we contend
that the meaning or purpose of autonomous decisions are better preserved
under the condition of mortality than under the condition of the counterfactual (i.e., the consequences for meaning if there were no such thing as
mortality); and (3) we propose a reconceptualization of spiritual identity
predicated upon (a) the observable phenomenon of human love and (b)
contemporary understanding of the capacity for self-transcendence.
Compatibilism and the Free Will Problem. Compatibilism refers to the
notion that “free” or autonomous decisions are compatible with natural
causation—that is, the cause-effect sequences of nature—and that both
can be fully accounted-for within the functional repertoire of a human
mind. The principal concern in crises of hope is that a natural chain of
causation that resolves to brain circuitry must somehow be “fixed” or determined, such that there is no room for freedom of will unless an external
actor or force or God (which is referred to below in more general terms
as a semantic engine as a generator of meaning) is pulled into the equation
(i.e., invoking dualism). And that without such an external entity to break
out of the chain of causation of the biological system of brain and mind—
that is, in the absence of belief in God as a separable external entity—there

a visual representation of “decision points” in systems of neural development and function. As the marble rolls down the hill (over the course of time), random forces determine
whether it goes right or left at the points of bifurcation. Within the troughs, there is minimal flexibility for outcome, until a next point of bifurcation is reached. Biological systems

allowing even minor perturbations to have major influences on outcome. [Color figure can

is no opportunity for freedom of will nor therefore meaningful decisionmaking. We concentrate here on the fallacy that whatever is “determined”
via the natural causation inherent in the circuitry of brain and mind is incompatible with freedom of decision-making. To address this, we briefly
elaborate the philosophical position of compatibilism, as a foundation for
resolution of the free will problem in crises of hope. For excellent detailed
original works on this position, readers are referred to Perry (2010) and
Dennett (2015), whose insights are particularly relevant and which we
have judiciously incorporated into this section.
As a preface to addressing the compatibility of causal determination
and freedom, it is first important to point out that within the realm of
science there are important known boundaries on what is determinable.
In physics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle asserts that the exact position and momentum of an object cannot be measured nor known for
the same instant of time. The position and momentum exist (i.e., follow
natural causation), yet the determination of these two physical properties is
clouded in uncertainty. A corollary in brain development and function is
a stochastic influence, illustrated by Waddington’s Landscape (Figure 2;
Waddington 1957), which is a random event of usually minor significance, but whose influence is greatly amplified when it occurs at just the
right time. Figure 2 schematically illustrates this as forks in the path of a

marble rolling down a three-dimensional surface. It has been demonstrated
in both human (White 2019; Castelbaum et al., 2020) and animal brain
and behavioral systems (Kees-Jan Kan et al., 2012) that stochastic influences can have pronounced effects during critical periods or in states of
stress or impairment, which are otherwise buffered in more “canalized”
epochs of development (Ferrell 2012; Andrew Feinberg 2012).
Another important embedded feature of neural systems that limits their
determinability and enables their emergent properties (see below) is level
of complexity. Crises of hope engender reductionist views of the circumstances of life, in which absence of agency is likened to simple metaphors
such as being a puppet on a string or a dog on a leash or a line of dominoes.
An object as inanimate as a silicon chip can, itself, store libraries of musical
or theatrical performance that are capable of inspiring and motivating human behavior. The brain and mind comprise a dynamic and vastly parallel
and analog system of such storage functions that can be turned on or off,
called up at will, amplified, mitigated, integrated, and organized in service
of intention and action. It is with this background that we proceed with
John Perry’s formulation of the foundational position of compatibilism,
here applied to a conscious decision:
An act can be free, in the sense that we could have done otherwise [i.e., had
competence and opportunity] even if the state of the relevant part of the
universe at some time previous to our doing it or not doing it and the laws
of nature settle that we will do it. (Perry 2010, 97)

Perry distinguishes the chain of causation in making a singular choice
from the issue of whether it is possible to alter that choice at the moment
of decision. To illustrate this, he describes the logic sequence guiding selection of a particular brand of milk from the grocery store, on the basis of his
wife’s preference, given many brands to choose from, emphasizing the predictability of his action. He maintains, however, that he could have selected
a different brand at the moment of decision-making, even if it violated
the usual reasons for milk selection, and that this capacity to override a
rational sequence is a representation of freedom in decision-making. This
position is articulated in clinical scenarios in which individuals stand at
the brink of serious or irrevocable instances of harm to self or others—
empowering them to exercise ownership of decisions to preserve life and
safety rather than destroy it, and clarifying that their ability to do so is a
refutation of some of their own worst fears (i.e., that they are powerless to
chart the course of their own destiny). Such moments of decision-making
were also articulated by Locke:
For the mind having in most cases, as is evident in experience, a power to
suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires; and so all, one
after another; is at liberty to consider the objects of them, examine them on
all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty man has…in

this seems to consist that which is (as I think improperly) called free-will.
For during this suspension of any desire…we have opportunity to examine,
view, and judge of the good or evil of what we are going to do; and when,
upon due examination we have judged we have done our duty; and it is not
a fault, but a perfection of our nature, to desire, will, and act according to
the last results of fair examination. (John Locke 1959, Essay, II, XXI, 48)

In his seminal work, Elbow Room—The Varieties of Free Will Worth
Wanting, Dennett (2015) emphasizes that the neural architecture of human consciousness is such that an act can simultaneously represent (1) the
effect of a physical chain of causation mediated by brain circuitry, and (2)
the result of the execution of the decision of a rational will, irrespective
of whether there exist tendencies to act in predictable ways under particular circumstances. Contemporary models of consciousness incorporate
understanding that the brain is designed to manage the parallel processes
of sensorimotor function, cognition, and emotion, each of which can contribute to the continuous stream of awareness moment-to-moment over
time, and it is a particular necessity and function of the brain to prioritize (conscious) or de-prioritize (unconscious) “details” of these parallel
streams of information in service of moment-to-moment predictive modeling, intentionality, and choice.
Reminiscent of Locke’s perspective, Dennett highlights the human capacity for self-reflection in conscious decision-making—the ability to examine, probe, question, and choose between alternatives—and to do so repeatedly and at increasing levels of depth and complexity over the course of
development and maturation. He makes the case that in practical terms,
and when considering physical limits imposed by (a) the speed of nerve
conduction and (b) the time it takes to process a given input (whether
generated by the brain itself or by a separable semantic engine), the human brain approximates the function of a semantic engine (i.e., a meaning
generator) so closely that there is no meaningful difference between the
respective capabilities that could be ascribed to one versus the other.
“Only some of the portions of the physical universe have the property of
being caused to have reliable expectations about what will happen next,
and hence have the capacity to control things, including themselves. And
only some of these have the further capacity of significant self-improvement
(through learning). And fewer still have the open-ended capacity (required a
language of self-description) for “radical self-evaluation.” These portions of
the world are thus loci of self-control, of talent, of decision-making. They
have projects, interests, and values they create in the course of their own
self-evaluation and self-definition. How much less like a domino could a
portion of the physical world be?” (Dennett 2015, 109).

This human capacity to “construct” self through iterative processes of
reflection, self-evaluation, and decision-making is a critical element of
Dennett’s model (he refers to this as the construct of “self-made selves”).

Beginning with blind trial and error, our interactions with the world as infants are shaped by reinforcement, but these interactions identify learning
opportunities that, according to Dennett, become candidates for nonblind
consideration, and the architecture of meaning-guided decision-making.
Over the course of human evolution, the mind has become “a more and
more reliable mimic of the perfect semantic engine (the entity that hears
Reason’s voice directly), because it was designed to be capable of improving itself in this regard; it was designed to be indefinitely self-redesigning”
(Dennett 2015, 34).
In this view, invoking an immaterial component of decision-making
(i.e., outside of physical reality) is unnecessary for establishing the capacity for free will, and actually complicates things by raising the problem of who or what is actually in control: the “external” influence
of an immaterial component of mind could paradoxically lower the
level of freedom that an autonomous human mind actually possesses,
if that external influence were coercing the decision-making in a way
that conflicts with the will of the individual. This raises the question
of whether there is any “value-added” to freedom even when an external semantic engine is invoked (i.e., over and above that which is already within the capability of a human brain and mind). The inherent capacity for self-redesign through learning, self-reflection, and choice
mediates not only freedom but identity (“self-made selves”) and creativity (often regarded as a reflection of the Divine) within a living
system.
Importantly, within such a system, reasons for doing things do not need
to be biologically reflexive or to make sense evolutionarily, a point to which
we will return in the sections below. When making decisions, we use strategies that allow us to choose responses most in line with the reasons, beliefs,
and identity that are forged in the course of life experience. Some decisions have little impact on identity, such as what type of milk I will select.
Others hold identity more centrally, such as what profession I will enter.
Furthermore, in making decisions, the parallel inputs are so numerous that
we cannot evaluate every possible variable and factor in an endless or perseverative regression to the origin of every thought or consideration. This
would lead to paralysis. The interjection of time makes it incumbent upon
an individual to enact decisions within timeframes required for intended
effects and anticipated consequences. Thus, the ability to decide when
to “stop” mental regressions, and instead employ heuristic methods that
give us the best approximation we can make is an important parameter
of self-control, one that can be severely compromised in obsessional states
or syndromes. In this context, a “leap of faith” can be seen as a decision
to prioritize what is more versus less aligned with the highest values of a
self-made self.

Even if determinism holds sway within any of the contributing parallel
processes (awareness, reflection on the alternatives, “stopping”), Dennett
clarifies that those causal processes alone cannot account for the level of
overarching control experienced in human agency, which leverages selfobservation and the use of information feedback loops to adjust courses of
action based on the assimilation of new information (learning):
If we are also deterministic devices, we need not on that account fear that
we cannot be in control of ourselves and our destinies. Moreover, the past
does not control us. It no more controls us than the people at NASA can
control the spaceships that have wandered out of reach in space…Causal
links are not enough for control. There must also be feedback to inform the
controller. There are no feedback signals from the present to the past for the
past to exploit. Moreover, there is nothing in the past to foresee and plan
for our particular acts, even if it is true that Mother Nature—gambling on
our general needs and predicaments—did, in effect, design us to fend quite
well for ourselves…”. (Dennett 2015, 79–80)

Moving beyond the immediate “self,” Dennett clarifies that decisionmaking does not exist in a vacuum, rather the repertoire of opportunity is
expanded by social context. Our role in a “village” affords the option to
extend beyond internally directed desires to those of shared interest and
purpose. This introduces yet another dimension of input into any given
instance of decision-making. “It is our communal activity of mutual persuasion, reflection, and evaluation that creates the values that then take
precedence over the cruder interests of our ancestors” (Dennett 2015, 51,
italics added for emphasis). In a consideration reminiscent of the opening of the Gospel according to St. John, “In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1, NRSV
Bible), Dennett places special emphasis on the role of language as a key
mediator of our ability to engage with one another in persuasion, reflection, and conversation to shape the construction (creation) of ourselves.
Through communication (including abstract expression through the arts),
our goals, desires, and purpose can be extended beyond the corporal and
temporal limitations of self. We can share our internal cognitive states, represent abstractions, and analogize representations of the world around us
and within us—both tangible and intangible, again allowing for reason to
extend beyond what recapitulates evolutionary “practicality”:
The rationality Nature has endowed us with is practical; it makes a difference by moving us, for the most part, in appropriate directions. But we must
not suppose that it is only practical, that it is an endowment tied directly
and rigidly to serving the biological ends that gave birth to it…a particular powerful part of that endowment derives from our capacity for language…Without having an important biological function to serve, something as complex as language could never evolve. But once it has arrived
on the evolutionary scene, the endowment for language makes room for
all manner of biologically trivial or irrelevant or baroque (nonfunctional)

endeavors: gossip, riddles, poetry, philosophy. In seeing how evolution has
made reason practical, we have also seen how evolution can give birth to
impractical reason. (Dennett 2015, 53–54)

Finally, Dennett emphasizes the importance of belief in one’s own
freedom, without which it is literally impossible to engage it. It is this
construct of “faith”—that we must believe in our own freedom to
participate in decision-making—that represents another tangible and
under-appreciated point of common ground for reconciling spirituality and science. The absence of faith can sabotage freedom through the
self-fulfilling prophesy of helplessness:
We all know the feeling at times: the terrible existential funk in which we
recognize that we have slid self-defeatingly into the passive spectator attitude, fecklessly wondering what we are going to do, or think, next. Instead
of thinking ahead, planning and hoping and trying to anticipate the world,
we spiral down into a regress of self-preoccupation that squanders our time,
virtually guaranteeing that our self-image of futility and indecision come
true. For it is very likely…that believing that one has free will is itself one of
the necessary conditions for having free will: an agent who enjoyed the other
necessary conditions for free will—rationality, and the capacity for higher
order self-control and self-reflection—but who has been hoodwinked into
believing he lacked free will would be almost as incapacitated for free, responsible choice by that belief as by the lack of any of the other necessary
conditions. (Dennett 2015, 183)

In a summarizing appeal to those still skeptical about whether freedom
is “built in” to the biological architecture of human consciousness, Dennett states the following:
Ask yourself: can I even conceive of beings whose wills are freer than our
own? What regrettable feature of our lot as physical organisms is not a feature of their lot? … There’s no sense wringing our hands because we can’t
undo the past, and can’t prevent an event that actually happens, and can’t
create ourselves ex nihilo, and can’t choose both alternatives to a decision
point, and can’t be perfect. (Dennett 2015, 188)

In clinical practice, resolving the free will problem, and thereby reassuring a patient that he or she possesses the capacity to make meaningful
decisions, is a critical antidote when helplessness (in this case the assumption that loss of faith means loss of capacity to choose) is a principal driver
of major depression or a crisis of hope. Further details on resolution of existential conflict in the clinical management of major depression are elaborated in Baumel and Constantino (2020), to which interested readers are
referred. In the text box below, we provide an example, Clinical Vignette
1, a case that highlights the relevance of compelling reassurance about freedom of will to clinical outcome.

Clinical Vignette 1. Following the experience of a concussion from
which he fully recovered, J. L., a 24-year-old accountant became absorbed with the idea that his awareness of God was wholly dependent
upon the intact functioning of his brain, to the extent that he came to
view his religious beliefs as fragile and somewhat disingenuous, especially
since God was supposed to have more power than a brain. He generalized this line of thinking to the point of believing that he had no real
control over the decisions he made, and gradually capitulated to a position of accepting and acting upon impulse, in a chronic state of disbelief
that there could be any source of control over the course of his life other
than “what my brain tells me to do.” He externalized responsibility for
both successes and failures, lost motivation to pursue personal and occupational goals, started neglecting household tasks, followed by his work;
this eroded his relationships with close friends and family members, and
ultimately, he lost his job. He began drinking heavily for the first time in
his life and retreated to a position of helplessness and fatalism. He viewed
himself and others as “pawns” in the succession of human generations,
as beings unworthy of the time or esteem of others or the community
resources they depleted by being alive. He became convinced that both
he and the world would be better off if he were dead, and viewed himself as a being of a different substance than God, tethered to his own
biology, and thereby irrevocably cut off from God. The approach to his
clinical care began with a 12-step program in which he identified as a
“higher power” a close loved one whom he admired deeply and who had
expressed to him how personally devastating it would be if he were to
end his life. He complied with the program and his drinking problem
resolved. In individual therapy, he was helped to understand how the assumption of helplessness had itself triggered a wholesale conversion of his
life, and he began to explore his own perspective on the nature of God,
including the layers of similarity between the will and love of God and
that expressed by his “higher power.” He considered deeply whether he
expected God to be the primary source of “control” of his life—any more
than his “higher power” would be considered the source of control of his
drinking—or rather a proponent of his own freedom. Gradually, a sense
of agency over the course of his own life was restored, his notion of God
reconciled with recognition of ways in which spirituality can manifest in
the material world (including its tangible impact on his own recovery),
and his depression resolved.
In concluding this section on the free will problem, we wish to clarify
that neither John Perry nor Daniel Dennett elaborate their philosophical
positions for the purpose of supporting religious faith per se—here we have
summarized their insights to establish a plausible scientific framework for

human freedom that does not depend upon an immaterial or supernatural
semantic engine. In the sections below, we will address how human brain
and mind can be directed toward the pursuit of spirituality, conceptualized
according to its manifestations in the observable world.
Mortality and Its Counterfactual. The fatalistic perspective articulated
by Shakespeare’s MacBeth ([1606] 2021)—that if all roads lead to death
how can anything mean anything?—is a universal existential question. In
states of pain or suffering, or when death seems particularly imminent, it
is common for distressed individuals to express a wish to “get it over with
rather than prolonging the misery.” This is said to have been experienced
by St. Francis DeSales (Wright 1988) who, when reflecting upon his indulgent young adulthood, reached the inescapable conclusion that he was
destined never to reach heaven. He proceeded to isolate himself in his
room for months, during the course of which historical characterizations
of his behavior are reminiscent of textbook descriptions of melancholic
depression. St. Francis’ emergence from his room was famously predicated
upon a decision to accept his unworthiness of heaven and to make the most
of the only life he had. Having a sense of urgency and the preciousness of
something that was time-limited, he embarked upon a life of extraordinary
productivity, including distinguished missionary work, prolific writing (he
is memorialized as the patron saint of authors), and the founding of a religious order. His motivation as a priest reflected an avoidance of wishful
thinking about heaven, rather on what could be done in service of the
Divine in the here and now.
Another perspective on acceptance of death was articulated by a young
school-aged boy who had been brought up in a religious tradition and
described a sense of guilt that he had decided he did not want to go to
heaven, indicating that “forever is a really, long time and sooner or later it
would get boring and everybody would be standing around with nothing
left to say.” As allegorically depicted in the comedy Groundhog Day, the
prospect of immortality elicits its own existential problems. Studies in the
field of positive psychology suggest that when individuals consciously remind themselves of an impending end point (e.g., only two more months
left of college), they experience events as more meaningful and assert that
they utilize the time they have left to greater advantage (Bono 2018). By
extension, in the absence of any end point (death in particular), it is conceivable that no decision would have any particularly meaningful consequence; there would be an eternity to “make up” for any mistake that was
made or any action with an undesired consequence. In this sense, mortality functions as a substrate for both meaning and creativity (the ability to
bring into being, through time-limited decision-making, what would not
otherwise exist), a capacity commonly attributed to God, but here within
the repertoire of every human life.

Clinical Vignette 2. Following the breakup of a romantic relationship, a college student became increasingly concerned about mortality
and the direction and purpose of her life. She entertained serious doubts
about the prospect of heaven (a fixture of her religious upbringing) and
began frantically reaching out to friends to determine whether they had
had similar experiences. She became disillusioned with her long-term
plan of earning a liberal arts degree that she considered a waste of the
limited time she had to live her life, and could not conceive of anything worth doing because all roads would lead to death. She became
deeply absorbed with questions about whether anything meant anything,
and exquisitely sensitive to environmental triggers that reminded her of
death; for example, roadside trash reminded her of the destruction of the
earth’s environment and this intensified a sense of futility about her own
existence. She had no evidence of disordered thought and was completely
cooperative, articulate, and earnestly sought out clinical support. She acknowledged that she had lost hope that there would ever be a pathway
to meaning in her life (“I’ve tried everything and I just can’t find a way
out of this”) and was beginning to contemplate a way to hasten her own
demise, because of how stressful and anxiety-provoking it was to “wait
around for the inevitable.”
The approach to her treatment began with an examination of her concern about mortality, including presentation of a hypothetical scenario in
which there was no such thing as death. She was encouraged to explore
the consequences of her own decisions and actions in this scenario, and
came to the conclusion that the lack of the boundary of death would diminish rather than accentuate the impact of the decisions she made and
actions she undertook in her endless life. She remained agitated about
the prospect of death, questioning why life ending in death was worth
the heartache and struggle. This prompted a next series of therapeutic
encounters focused on what she construed as good causes in life, which
centered around a compassionate societal infrastructure for the less fortunate. She was asked to consider whether she believed it would be best for
their lives to be “over with” so as not to suffer unnecessarily, a notion that
she perceived as viscerally abhorrent. When asked why she should view
the prospect of intentionally terminating life differently when applied
to herself than for others, she was initially at a loss—the contrast took
her somewhat by surprise—but she recognized within herself a longing
to champion the quality of life for others. She identified with the likely
impact of her actions on others as she herself had the experience of being
loved and supported by her family, and came to view herself as a link in
a chain of causation across generations, in which the quality of any given
life was influenced by the nature of connections with all others, and the
strength of those connections was determined by intentional decisions
to help one another. Her condition gradually improved, she switched to

an academic track in engineering that would afford her opportunity to
work on solutions to infrastructure problems that seriously compromised
quality of life for people in cities. Her anxiety about death and perseveration about meaning gradually dissipated and her hope in her own future
was restored.
This “glass-half-full” view of mortality as a kind of mercy—an enhancer
rather than a detractor of meaning—carries the potential to disarm the
more paralyzing and nihilistic preoccupations with mortality that occur in
clinical crises of hope, as illustrated in Clinical Vignette 2. Returning to
Dennett (2015), if the cognitive architecture of the human brain makes
possible the construction of self, and the consequences of autonomous
decision-making enable an extension of the impact of self upon universe,
even beyond the time of death (e.g., the legacy of St. Francis DeSales),
then people are substantively endowed with the power to affect the world
in ways that transcend the boundaries of self and the interval of a lifetime.
Redefining identity as distributable across time and space and inclusive of
an individual’s life work and its consequences, as captured in the spiritual
tradition of Yizkor in Judaism, comprise an alternate representation of life
after death.
Recognition of mortality is also associated with a specific type of anxiety
over what one ought to do with the time left to live. The dread of decisionmaking in this context is potentially paralyzing as considered by Søren
Kierkegaard: “One may liken angst to dizziness. He whose eye chances
to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy…Angst is the dizziness of freedom which emerges when the spirit would posit the synthesis,
and freedom then gazes down into its own possibility, grasping finiteness
to sustain itself. Freedom succumbs in this dizziness” (Søren Kierkegaard
[1844] 1980, 152). In another sense, however, the induction of anxiety
over the existential concern of choice functions as its own driver of creativity as noted by the philosopher Charlie Kurth, the fact that one can experience anxiety in a decision “captures something admirable about you—
namely, your sensitivity to the significance of the decision you must make
and your awareness of the limits of your knowledge and experience in the
matters…your anxiety doesn’t just help you make a better decision…it’s
also the epitome of your virtuous concern” (Kurth 2018, 5).

Having established a framework for human freedom, and the principle
that mortality may enhance rather than detract from the consequences of
decision-making in a given life, we turn now to the nature of decisionmaking in relation to spirituality. We begin with the opportunity described
above by Dennett to diverge from what is biologically or evolutionarily
“reflexive,” that is, to engage in “impractical reason.” As stated by Richard
Dawkins: “We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth…We
can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism—something that has no place in nature [that is, in a
Hobbesian state of nature—DCD], something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world…We, alone on earth, can rebel
against the tyranny of the selfish replicators” (Dawkins 1976, 215).
Exercising freedom in the intentional pursuit of spiritual decisionmaking can take many forms—reflection, meditation, contemplation,
prayer, and other specific expressions of spiritual devotion. One of the
more pragmatic forms considered “sacred” among both religious and nonreligious people is the phenomenon of human love. When construed as
decision-making rather than as emotion per se, it involves exercising human freedom to place the needs of “other” over the needs of self. It can
be differentiated from altruism in that decisions to love are rendered without condition or inference of ecological advantage. It represents a break
from evolutionarily preserved impulses to protect self, and is considered
an “opposite” of many constructs (simultaneously), including selfishness,
hatred, and notably fear. The latter is a particularly important distinction,
since fear is often the root of hatred and self-absorption and functions as
a self-preservation reflex, typically antithetical to the kinds of freedom we
have described here, except when acted upon vicariously as in the protection of a loved one. Since decisions to love are unfettered by contingency,
the need for psychological assurance, or expectation of reciprocity, love has
been considered the ultimate manifestation of the human capacity for free
will (Walsch 1995, 18–19), the architecture for which is built in to human
consciousness, as we have elaborated here. Aspiring to a life dominated by
loving can itself be viewed as a longer-term choice between autonomous
decision-making and the coercion by more self-preserving instincts (mediated by Dawkins’ “selfish genes”), and this contrast serves as a pragmatic
distinction between spiritual and nonspiritual orientation within the material world.
To the extent that meaning is linked to the level of freedom in decisionmaking, it would follow that decisions to love are among the most meaningful that can be made in a lifetime: they result in the intentional
bringing-into-being of what would not otherwise have existed, as in a love
relationship, an act of love, or a work motivated by love. In this sense, it
is a tangible manifestation of the capacity to create de novo, from start
to finish—a power that is sometimes reserved for the Divine. It should

be emphasized that while meaning can be generated as a function of freedom in decision-making (e.g., the decision to love), that does not preclude
meaning from also being inherent. However, this inherent meaning typically comes to fruition when we encounter the opportunity to partake
in our role as “co-creators”. Here, we are invoking a pathway to meaning
that is accessible to individuals in crisis who formerly construed meaning
as solely imbued by the Divine.
Love itself is often considered a principal signature of the Divine. Conceiving a human being as capable of making autonomous decisions to love
without condition places her/him in a kind of equanimity with the Divine: “Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love” (1
John 4:8, NRSV Bible). A conceptualization of spirituality that considers
love-based decision-making a material representation of the Divine, allows
for the material realm to be construed as common ground for spirituality
and science. We note that in the Christian tradition, the incarnation of
the Divine in the life of Jesus Christ is manifested more poignantly by love
than by miracles, by sacrifice than by triumph, by service to all than by
exalting of self. Here we have attempted to provide a substrate for updating contemporary “incarnation theology,” and operationalizing aspects of
spirituality in the here and now.
Furthermore, the construct of love we have forwarded as a form of
decision-making rather than a function of an immaterial soul infers the
possibility of an intentional reconstruction of identity to include other as
of equal or greater priority to self. This is also referred to as transcendence
of self, reflected in human acts of outreach summarized in the preface of
Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass:
This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise
riches, give alms to everyone that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy,
devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning
God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to
nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely
with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year
of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any
book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be
a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the
silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in
every motion and joint of your body. (2005, Leaves of Grass, Preface, 1855)

That this is conceivable on the basis of function of brain and mind—
that is, freedom, and the capacity for love-based decision-making that materializes transcendence of self and connection with other in an intentional
re-framing of identity—makes it possible to characterize spirituality in a
manner that is compatible with science and observable in the here and
now. One of the highest aspirations of major religions (from the Latin

religare to re-bind or tie together) is to promote within human societies
a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (in Christianity, “that they
may all be one” John 17:21, NRSV Bible)—both love and altruism tangibly embrace such formation, even when doing so risks diminishment
or dissolution of self. Mutual investment in love-based decision-making,
by pairs or communities of people—in essence, reciprocal elaboration of
transcendence of self—provides a substrate for spiritual community, another opportunity for common ground between faith and science, with
documented effects in the prevention or resolution of crises of hope
(Mosqueiro et al., 2021). Integration with the larger social network redefines identity in a way that transcends temporal and corporal limitations
as expressed in the Zulu word “Ubuntu” which translates to, “I am because
we are,” by which contribution to a societal “whole” occurs on the basis of
autonomous decision-making. It is possible to derive one’s strongest, most
sustaining sense of identity—and by extension meaning and purpose—
from such personal investment, which includes the formation of “village”
composed of families and lasting social networks.

Conclusion
Reason is in fact the path to faith, and faith takes over once reason can say
no more.
—Thomas Merton, The Ascent of Truth ([1951] 2002, 29)

In Edwin Abbott’s satirical novella, Flatland (1884), the human search for
the Divine is likened to grappling with the mathematical notion of an extra dimension: its hypothetical universe is constrained to a planar surface,
from which a sphere is only perceptible in two dimensions, as a dot when
it first intersects with the plane, which mysteriously enlarges as a circle that
subsequently shrinks, and disappears as it makes a passage through Flatland. A marvel even from a two-dimensional perspective, but never fully
appreciable for its “sphere-ness.” In this article, we have chosen to anchor
a reconceptualization of the Divine (a sphere by analogy) through the lens
of science (a two-dimensional plane), an enterprise that to some believers may seem an unacceptable level of reductionism, but to the skeptical, a
more tangible common ground. As a starting point it may be better to embrace a two-dimensional representation of the Divine than to dismiss its
existence altogether, especially if the third dimension has been over-sold, or
has unnecessarily discarded science, leaving the implications of what is observable in two dimensions—tethers for skeptics—underestimated, devalued, or underappreciated for its promise in reconciling faith and science.
Therefore, in this article we have intentionally avoided entanglement over
a “third dimension” (i.e., what is characterized by the immaterial: miracles,
dualism, or unknowable elements of life after death), and have focused
more on aspects of faith that relate to the actions and decisions and op-

portunities of human beings in the observable world, exemplified by the
intentional commitment to prioritize other over self, even in the most difficult of life’s circumstances, including those encountered in concentration
camps described by Frankl and by “heroes of faith” recounted by St. Paul,
who included the homeless, imprisoned, and penniless, and “of whom the
world was not worthy” (Hebrews 11:37–40, NRSV Bible). In Christianity,
the epitome of manifestation of the Divine in the natural world is the life
of Jesus Christ.
This is not in any way to dismiss or disavow facets of religion that concern themselves with the unknowable, with immaterial dimensions of existence, or with matters of pure faith. Rather, it is to assert that there are
foundational aspects of spirituality that are themselves compatible with
what is observable in the here-and-now and can be honestly relied upon
in crises of hope. Here, we have operationalized decision-making according to the compatibilism of natural causation and human freedom, parameterized “meaning” on the basis of specific opportunities for decisionmaking within the timeframe of a lifetime and have articulated a model
of self-transcendence that avoids unnecessary dichotomization of the material and the Divine. In the Christian tradition, the essence of the Divine
was manifest in the physical form of a human being, according to whom
spirit is equated with love. Rather than provoking arguments over immaterial aspects of spirituality (miracles, or more literal conceptualizations
of life after death), it is our hope that this appraisal of what is tenable
on the basis of contemporary understanding of brain and mind and daily
life experience will provide a blueprint for contemporary reconciliation of
spirituality and science, especially as is necessary in crises of hope that are
precipitated by unresolved conflicts between the two.
The common ground that we have invoked for religion and science
can be construed as a sort of “bottom-up” rather than “top-down” conceptualization of spirituality; that critical aspects of spiritual life arise as
“emergent” properties of brain, mind, and human interaction, according
to principles and forces of nature that brought them into existence. In
seminal work published in the journal Neuron, Krakauer et al. (2017, 484)
describe emergent properties in this way:
Neurons in their aggregate organization cause effects that are not apparent
in any single neuron…An example of an emergent behavior that can only be
understood at the algorithmic level, which in turn can only be determined
by studying the emergent behavior itself, is flocking in birds. First one has
to observe the behavior and then one can begin to test simple rules that will
lead to reproduction of the behavior, in this case best done through simulation… Clearly, observing or dissecting an individual bird, or even several
birds could never derive such a rule. Substitute flocking with a behavior
like reaching, and birds for neurons, and it becomes clear how adopting an
overly reductionist approach can hinder understanding.

Neuropsychologist and theologian Patrick McNamara (2020) similarly
rejects reductionism in neuroscience and asserts that essential truths concern the whole, and wholes cannot be explained simply by decomposing
them into their constituent parts. In translating this to crises of faith,
the reductionist thinking that leads to the notion “I am not free” or
“nothing means anything” constitutes a kind of “throwing out of a baby
with the bathwater.” Observable manifestations of human spirituality,
such as love, can and should serve as an anchoring hope for the perplexed,
and as a place to begin a journey of spiritual formation when larger leaps
of faith are perceived as bridges too far.
We have approached this exploration of the interface between science
and faith with a conviction that spirituality is always “better off” when
it fully incorporates scientific truth. This is no easier today than it was
when gravitational force replaced Divine intervention as the predominating theory for why the sun rises and sets. Science continuously clarifies
what can and cannot be invoked as a foundation of religious belief, and it
is in this spirit that scientific understanding of brain and mind are synthesized in this article. To believe otherwise, that is, to contend that one must
choose between science and faith is a position that we reject, as strongly as
we would reject an assertion that one cannot be religious if one accepts the
gravitational model of a sunrise. It is our hope that this synthesis of current
understanding will open new avenues of dialogue, widen the playing field
of opportunity for spiritual formation in a way that is compatible with
the inexorable march of scientific progress, and invigorate personal investment in what we believe to be a signature manifestation of spirituality in
the observable world, which is human love.
