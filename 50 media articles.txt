‘Free Will,’ by Sam Harris - The New York Times

Have It Your Way
By Daniel Menaker
July 13, 2012

For centuries, the question of free will — of whether human beings make choices that are
not, or not entirely, determined by purely physical processes and causes — nested
securely in the aeries of philosophy and religion. Ordinary people didn’t worry about its
having any practical significance for them. Although the issue of individual responsibility
has animated novels, poetry, drama and parables, most modern people have gone about
their lives believing that their minds were the agents of their decisions.
But the last half-century has seen this ancient subject pulled down from its academic
perch and into courtrooms, laboratories, real-world questions about moral responsibility,
and even popular culture. (It forms the plot of such contemporary movies as “Minority
Report” and “The Adjustment Bureau.”)
Over the last few decades, procedures for measuring, imaging and analyzing mental
processes have grown in number and subtlety. During this same period, books for the
general reader about the brain and its functions, consciousness and will, thought and
reasoning have proliferated. We have Daniel Dennett, Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins,
Cordelia Fine, Oliver Sacks, Michael Gazzaniga, Daniel Kahneman and scores of others
explaining, and extrapolating from, new findings in neuroscience and almost always
addressing the matter of free will. (Daniel Wegner’s “Illusion of Conscious Will,”
published by the MIT Press in 2002, is a central full-length scientific text about this
subject.)
Sam Harris, a Stanford graduate with a Ph.D. in neuroscience from U.C.L.A. and author of
“The End of Faith,” a best-selling, Hitchensesque critique of religion, has now, in book
form and fully armored, joined the free-will jousters with a kind of tractatus — a
pamphlet-like work, “Free Will.” Parts of this book recycle some of Harris’s earlier writing
on the subject (as should have been acknowledged in the book’s front matter and will be
in future editions). But the work consists mainly of original text and distills Harris’s
position on the crucial issue of human agency.
His absolutist position, I should add, because, as he puts it near the beginning of the
book: “Free will is an illusion. Our wills are simply not of our own making. Thoughts and
intentions emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we
exert no conscious control.” We assume that we could have made other choices in the
past, Harris continues, and we also assume that we consciously originate “our thoughts
and actions in the present. . . . Both of these assumptions are false.”

Harris prosecutes his orderly case by explaining what he sees as the illogic of our belief
in free will, and the recent findings that have undermined that belief. Probably the most
influential among these discoveries were the results of the famous EEG experiments
conducted by the physiologist Benjamin Libet and others in the early 1980s. They showed
that the brain makes decisions before consciousness becomes aware of them. As Harris
puts it, “activity in the brain’s motor cortex can be detected some 300 milliseconds” —
almost enough time for LeBron James to get off a shot ahead of the buzzer — “before a
person feels that he has decided to move.” As Harris’s text and impressive citations
substantiate, these experiments and others like them have chiseled away much of the
rock of free will upon which religion, jurisprudence and moral judgments have
traditionally rested. (One could argue that Judaism and Christianity originated with
Adam and Eve’s decision to disobey God’s order.)
For quite a while now, philosophers and public intellectuals, including Harris’s friend
Dennett, have tried to rescue something like the common notion of free will from the jaws
of science and logic by embracing a position called compatibilism. Compatibilists believe
that “a person is free as long as he is free from any outer or inner compulsions,” Harris
writes, and they “have produced a vast literature in an effort” to salvage free will. “More
than in any other area of academic philosophy, the result resembles theology,” he
continues, consigning it to what one assumes is, for him, the intellectual subbasement.

‘Free Will,’ by Sam Harris - The New York Times

Like almost all other thinkers who have publicly rejected the traditional model of
conscious will, Harris claims that doing so does not entail the end of morality, the idea of
criminality and codes of ethical behavior. “Many people worry that free will is a
necessary illusion,” he says. “It is surely conceivable that knowing (or emphasizing)
certain truths about the human mind could have unfortunate psychological and/or
cultural consequences.” But it need not. We can still condemn “the conscious intention to
do harm,” he says, and he goes on to sketch a system of social and judicial evaluations
that can lead to making valid moral judgments about people without invoking their wills.
He even allows for the possible usefulness of public moral condemnation: “It may be that
a sham form of retribution would still be moral — even necessary — if it led people to
behave better than they otherwise would.” But he does acknowledge that “certain moral
intuitions begin to relax” with the abandonment of belief in free will. “Once we recognize
that even the most terrifying predators are, in a very real sense, unlucky to be who they
are, the logic of hating (as opposed to fearing) them begins to unravel.”
Even though Harris assures us that civilized society can survive and might even improve
with the abandonment of the concept of conscious agency, it would ultimately affect
everything — all of our doings and sayings and thoughts, especially in ordinary
sociomoral circumstances. This slender volume is perhaps less important in itself than in
its representation of the arguments for accepting that we are not “the authors of our
actions.”
As literature, “Free Will” has some mild humor — “If I want to put a rabbit in this
sentence, I am free to do so” — and some ringing pronouncements: “We are working
directly with the forces of nature, for there is nothing but nature itself to work with.” But it
is also generally prosaic, as most such intellectual treatises perforce tend to be. Harris
often resorts to the thought-experimenters’ clichés of inventing examples that involve
violence (shooting the president) or the quotidian (“I just drank a glass of water and feel
absolutely at peace with the decision to do so”). But if you want to acquaint yourself with
the chapbook basics of this essential argument, “Free Will” is a good, cogent and readable
. . . um, choice.
Of course, questions persist. What, after the dismantling of free will, is consciousness?
Just some kind of afflatus given off by three pounds of wetware? If so — if our conscious
lives are nothing but the meniscus covering what our brains and bodies are up to, well
then, isn’t that some glorious meniscus? It may not tell us what to do, but it does tell us
what what we do means — oh, and what beauty is.
Couldn’t it be that we need the experience of what Wegner and others call “perceived
control,” at least as a model of voluntary behavior, to get on with our lives and to have our
achievements recognized and to be instructed by our failures? (Doesn’t Harris enjoy his
success? I bet he does.) Finally, what happens to traditional qualities of character like

believe that his basic thesis must indeed be correct — it seems to me a sadder truth than
he wants to realize.

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange | Kathryn Paige Harden, M.W. Feldman, Jessica Riskin, et al. | The New York Review of Books

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange
Kathryn Paige Harden, Nick Patterson, Victor I. Reus, and Henry D. Schlinger Jr., reply by M.W.
Feldman and Jessica Riskin
June 9, 2022 issue

In response to:

Why Biology Is Not Destiny from the April 21, 2022 issue
To the Editors:
Marcus Feldman and Jessica Riskin did not like my book. Or rather,
they did not like a book called The Genetic Lottery by an author named
“Kathryn Paige Harden,” but their review [NYR, April 21] so badly
distorts my arguments that I have the curious impression that
Feldman and Riskin somehow got their hands on another book
entirely, an evil doppelgänger to mine. Therapists, parents, and the
unhappily married would recognize the feeling I had upon reading
their review the first time: it’s both vexing and bewildering when
someone is spoiling for a fight about something you never said.
As a longtime reader of The New York Review of Books, I am surprised
and disappointed that this review was published in such an esteemed
outlet. Yes, “we all enjoy an intemperate paragraph of syntactically
inspired bile,” to quote Zadie Smith, and Feldman and Riskin do
deliver the bile. But I assume that, besides wanting to be entertained
by vitriol, readers of book reviews are also interested in learning what
a book is about. Here, Feldman and Riskin’s review fails entirely. That
quote of Smith’s is from her review of My Prizes by Thomas Bernhard,
about which she wrote: “The gap between what actually happened and
how Bernhard writes of it can be interpreted variously as postmodern
playfulness or deceitful paranoia.” The gap between what The Genetic
Lottery says and how Feldman and Riskin write of it is very large
indeed, and no tone of playfulness is to be found.
Feldman and Riskin set out to slay three dragons: genetic determinism
(“why biology is not destiny”), genetic essentialism (“you are not your
genes”), and genetic reductionism (“all phenomena” are not “reducible
to nucleotides”). They argue that these three “isms” are not supported
by the scientific evidence—and I wholeheartedly agree. In fact, The
Genetic Lottery devotes considerable space to describing why these
three “isms” are wrong. As I summarize in the last chapter:
Much of this book has been taken up with these arguments. We should not
interpret genetic influences as deterministic. We should not give up on the
possibility of social policy to bring about social change. We should not
confuse an outcome being socially valued with a person being valuable.

Passages like this one, which directly contradict their characterization
of the book’s alleged determinism, reductionism, and essentialism, are
easy to find! But Feldman and Riskin are not here to engage with what
The Genetic Lottery says. Their aim, instead, is to expose what they see
as the sinister, repressed meanings of my book, which are cloaked, in
their view, by my cluelessness and my duplicitousness. Throughout the
review, I am portrayed as the unwitting dupe of false consciousness
(“beneath Harden’s protestations…”) or worse, as a liar (“with an
admirable poker face, Harden writes…”). The possibility that I might
mean what I say does not enter the picture. The hermeneutics of
suspicion has its place, I suppose, but as Paul Ricoeur said,
hermeneutics is animated by a “double motivation: willingness to
suspect, willingness to listen.” They forgot the listening part.
In addition to grossly distorting the arguments of my book, Feldman
and Riskin also turn their suspicious gaze to a variety of ordinary
scientific concepts. In their telling, the “normal” distribution, which
was first described, decades before Galton, by a mathematician
studying errors in astronomical observations, is a “founding axiom of
eugenics.” They write about the measurement of personality
differences in a conspiratorial tone more commonly associated with
Reddit discussions about the Deep State. They dismiss the importance
of random assignment for causal inference as “blowing smoke.” There
would be little left of the behavioral and social sciences if everything
that Feldman and Riskin considered dubious were removed.
But perhaps they would like to be rid of all of the behavioral and social
sciences? We could return to that more innocent time, when scientists
didn’t go about confusing cabbages with kings, when behavior was
understood solely in terms of “social practices” and free from any
reference to biology. You know, the good old days, when autism was
blamed on “refrigerator mothers” and being gay was blamed on
domineering ones, when schizophrenia was the result of familial
“double binds,” when patients with psychosis from late-stage syphilis
suffered without any treatment options.
There is no arguing with someone committed to a paranoid reading,
and doubtless Feldman and Riskin will respond to this letter with
further distortions about how my book should “really” be interpreted.
Fortunately, I trust readers. Based on the hundreds of e-mails and
comments I have received about The Genetic Lottery, people are more
than able to appreciate and engage with the book’s arguments. To
quote one (anonymous) reader comment:

As someone with a chronic illness influenced by genes (T1D), and the
mother of a child with a genetic syndrome and its attendant disabilities, I
have wished for someone to wade into the fraught waters between
eugenics on the right and the refusal to consider genes as important to life
outcomes on the left. It is impossible to live lives where genes have such
obvious and significant impact without feeling abandoned by both sides,
frankly; that, on the one hand, we should accept our lesser status and try
not to further contaminate the human race with our dirty genes, or on the
other, we have certain accessibility rights defined by physical limitations
but are never to link them to genetic causes in polite company, or mention
the gaps that such a refusal creates in our ability to live good lives. The
Genetic Lottery…elegantly discuss[es] how to address genetic causes for
social outcomes within a framework of equity and human rights.

Near the end of their review, Feldman and Riskin acknowledge that,
“True, genes shape people, and people make up social and cultural
situations.” They don’t take that idea any further, leaving unanswered
questions such as: How do we know that genes shape people? What
aspects of people do genes shape? And what should we do with any
new scientific insights about how genes shape people, especially if we
want to avoid the evils of eugenics? These are exactly the questions
that The Genetic Lottery addresses. Read it for yourself and decide.

To the Editors:
In the April 21, 2022, issue of The New York Review, M.W. Feldman and
Jessica Riskin publish a hostile review of Kathryn Paige Harden’s
recent book The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality.
The review makes some arguments that make no sense to me and
deserve rebuttal.
Let us discuss the genetics of Educational Attainment (EA), defined as
the number of years of schooling and measured in adults over thirty
years old. EA takes up a good part of both the book and the review.
Using genetic data from more than 300,000 individuals of European
ancestry, it was possible to develop a “score” using the genomes of the
people in the study. The details of the score are of lesser importance,
but it’s important to realize that the score is a single number
calculated from a genomic sample, by a fixed recipe. The score is
correlated with EA at an enormously significant statistical level. This
result was then replicated in an Icelandic study, using entirely different
individuals from the first study. Again enormously significant results
were obtained.
How do Feldman and Riskin explain these results? After a somewhat
rambling diatribe complaining that choices were made in the details of
the score, and how exactly the EA phenotype was chosen to study,
https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/06/09/why-biology-is-not-destiny-an-exchange/

3/10

24/03/2025, 11:15

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange | Kathryn Paige Harden, M.W. Feldman, Jessica Riskin, et al. | The New York Review of Books

they conclude that “researchers are [not] counting anything but their
own projections.” How is this reasonable? A recipe is given, checked in
a different study, and the results replicated. (Incidentally, a much larger
study with more than 3 million (!) individuals was completed just this
month and the results were again replicated.) Are we somehow to
believe that experimental error in Iceland is correlated with EA of a
sample? This is truly absurd.
The score has other interesting features. The average has been
decreasing in Iceland since at least 1910, and the score strongly
correlates between mating couples, an effect much stronger than
correlation of EA. This argues that the score is meaningful without
making the meaning clear. The work on EA is technically little
different from studies of the genetics of height, and if we took the
criticisms of Feldman and Riskin seriously that would invalidate an
enormous amount of modern genetics, in which it is routine to find
that complex traits are associated weakly with multiple genetic loci.
Feldman and Riskin also attack Harden for stating that the score will
be normally distributed. Claiming that a trait follows a bell-shaped
curve is “a founding axiom of eugenics.” This is an argument of guilt
by association. The score is a sum of small values mostly independent
and any geneticist, or statistician, will expect the distribution to be
approximately normal. In a given study it is trivial to check normality
of the computed scores.
This review is baffling. Feldman is a leading mathematical biologist at
Stanford who I would have assumed understands statistical genetics,
yet if I didn’t know who the reviewers were I would have thought that
they were incompetent or ignorant. Perhaps Feldman and Riskin think
that any argument is acceptable if it goes against results that they
dislike?

To the Editors:
M.W. Feldman and Jessica Riskin rightfully point out the many
fallacies and misinterpretations in Kathryn Paige Harden’s new book,
but appear dismissive of all efforts to identify genetic contributions to
complex behaviors, going so far as to suggest that investigating genetic
contributions to social life is somehow equivalent to comparing a copy
of the Krebs cycle to Shakespeare’s King Lear.
How then to understand such experiments of nature as WilliamsBeuren syndrome, a rare congenital genetic disorder caused by a
deletion of twenty-six to twenty-eight genes on chromosome 7, and

characterized by distinctive facial features, cognitive and
cardiovascular dysfunction, and, most interestingly, extreme social
affability and an engaging extroverted personality? Structural variants
of the genes identified in the syndrome furthermore have been found
to be associated with stereotypical hypersociability in dogs and
implicated in the behavioral divergence of dogs and wolves.
It is clear that unraveling complex behavioral phenotypes into
component parts that relate best to genetic risk is a difficult
undertaking, but it is not a folly, and a more sophisticated analysis of
the literature would accord greater respect for the field.

To the Editors:
M.W. Feldman and Jessica Riskin, in their excellent, well-written, and
very entertaining review of The Genetic Lottery by Kathryn Harden,
allude to but do not specify how one’s environment can be defined
functionally and scientifically. Such a definition is the crux of the
debate about nature and nurture and any discussion of genetic
influences on behavior.
I believe that Feldman and Riskin, not to mention everyone else who
talks about environment, would benefit from a behavioral view of
environment as “all stimuli that affect behavior at any given moment”
rather than the more widely accepted and general one which is “the
surrounding conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or
operates.”
The behavioral view of environment has three important implications:
1) the environment is not just our surroundings but is inside of us as
well because there are stimuli (pain, proprioceptive, etc.) that are
located inside our bodies that affect our behavior; 2) the environment
is constantly in flux as it comprises “all stimuli that affect an
individual’s behavior at any given moment,” which means that one’s
environment changes moment to moment; and 3) no two individuals
can ever have the same environment, not even monozygotic twins.
To the last point, my mother used to ask me how my two siblings and I
could be so different even though we were raised in the same
environment. Now I know that she meant the same parents, house, etc.
But according to a behavioral view of environment, we weren’t raised
in the same environment because one’s environment consists of all
stimuli that affect behavior moment to moment. And even though that
environment begins negligibly in the last trimester before birth, the

number of responses and stimuli explode and expand exponentially at
birth. When one considers the staggeringly high number of possible
behavioral responses and stimuli those responses can interact with,
any genetic explanation of human behavior takes a back seat to
environmental ones. As Feldman and Riskin wrote, “living things are
in continual interaction with their environments in ways that
transform both at every level.”
To the behavioral view of environment we can add the discovery of
how stimuli affect behavior as antecedent events (e.g., discriminative
stimuli) and, more importantly, as (reinforcing) consequences, which
themselves determine whether and how antecedent stimuli evoke (or
abate) behavior. This conception of environment and a selectionist
view of how consequences cause behavior have proven to be a much
more productive avenue for research and, perhaps more importantly,
interventions to change behavior in sometimes dramatic ways.
Of course, genetics cannot be completely discounted because the
capacity of an organism’s behavior to be affected by the environment
is a function of the species’ evolutionary history and genetic
endowment. Nonetheless, a functional and scientific conception of
environment can counteract to a large degree any biological or genetic
claims of behavioral causation.

M. W. Feldman and Jessica Riskin reply:

Kathryn Paige Harden accuses us of selective reading, but she herself
is an uncareful reader. To begin with, she writes that we’ve charged her
with “genetic determinism.” But we haven’t done this anywhere in our
review. We were as careful to acknowledge her disavowals of genetic
determinism as she was to place them at regular intervals throughout
her book. Although we didn’t quote the one she excerpts in her letter,
we did quote an equivalent one, which occurs on page 46: “One’s
genetics might not determine your life outcomes, but they are still
associated, among other things, with being hundreds of thousands of
dollars wealthier at the end of one’s working life.” As we said in
connection with this passage and others like it, Harden’s reductionism
is of an “I’m no reductionist but” variety; or we might just as well have
said that her essentialism is of an “I’m no essentialist but” variety.
Another example: “genetic luck is braided together with other
differences” (page 43), but “Can we really say that genes cause you to
be wealthier? (Short answer: yes)” (page 44).
When she says we described the “normal” distribution as “a founding
axiom of eugenics,” Harden misreads us. In fact, we wrote that the
assumption “that there are intrinsic cognitive and personality traits
https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/06/09/why-biology-is-not-destiny-an-exchange/

6/10

24/03/2025, 11:15

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange | Kathryn Paige Harden, M.W. Feldman, Jessica Riskin, et al. | The New York Review of Books

whose distribution in a population follows a bell-shaped curve” was a
founding axiom of eugenics—not, of course, the normal distribution
itself, which isn’t an axiom of any kind, eugenic or otherwise.
Harden also misquotes us when she writes that we “acknowledge that,
‘True, genes shape people, and people make up social and cultural
situations.’” She leaves out a crucial word. What we wrote was that
“genes help shape people,” hardly a momentous “acknowledgment”;
neither we nor anyone else would be likely to deny it.
Oddly, Harden says we seem nostalgic for a “more innocent time” in
the “good old days.” This is surprising: we wouldn’t have guessed our
historical sketch of eugenics and scientific racism in the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries could seem nostalgic. At the same time,
it’s interesting to note that the very conditions and characteristics she
lists as having received much worse treatment in those old days—
autism, homosexuality, schizophrenia, psychosis, and syphilis—all
seem like good examples of a principle we advanced in our review:
genes don’t cause everything. We agree that many today regard these
human phenomena in a better light than previously, but this is not due
to behavioral genetics or sociogenomics.
Finally, Harden asks whether we reject the psychological and
behavioral sciences altogether. We don’t: we reject those areas of the
psychological and behavioral sciences that claim a spurious reduction
of complex social phenomena to genes. Happily, we know that some
researchers in the area are pursuing better, less reductionist lines of
research. The intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of people in social
situations aren’t fixed and distinct but are continually shaping and
transforming one another, so that there’s no fact of the matter about
which causes what. It’s not that these situations are too complex for us
to figure out how much is intrinsic and how much extrinsic, but that
the question itself is meaningless. How much is the California
coastline due to the Pacific Ocean and how much to the North
American continent?
Overall, Harden’s letter confirms what we said in our review: while
disavowing essentialist, racist, and eugenic notions she affirms a new
version of the old illogic that has long supported them.
Nick Patterson’s arguments are beside the point. First, regarding
polygenic scores for “educational attainment,” he writes that these are
calculated “by a fixed recipe.” OK, but assuming this recipe didn’t
come from a burning bush, someone must have written it, making
many interpretive choices along the way, as we said in our review, such
as which single-nucleotide polymorphisms to consider, how to weight
and aggregate these, and what definition of “educational attainment”
to adopt. Patterson mentions “years of schooling.” Dissatisfaction

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange | Kathryn Paige Harden, M.W. Feldman, Jessica Riskin, et al. | The New York Review of Books

with this parameter led various institutions, including the US Census
Bureau, to replace it with “highest level of school completed or highest
degree achieved.”
These parameters too (like all parameters) carry ambiguities and
interpretive assumptions. For instance, what kinds of school? The
Census Bureau generally includes “professional” but not “vocational”
training, allowing training in chiropractic but not automotive
mechanics or airline maintenance. The main study that Patterson cites
(Okbay et al. 2016) draws on many surveys conducted in different
countries, all with different educational systems and definitions of
“educational attainment,” and uses a UN framework to normalize the
results to “years of education.” In short, Patterson’s “fixed recipe”
hides many layers of implicit social theory.
Next, Patterson emphasizes that polygenic risk scores correlate with
“educational attainment” to a statistically significant degree; he in fact
says these correlations are “enormously significant.” Since
“enormous” is not a technical term it’s hard to guess what he might
understand by it. “Significant” does have a technical meaning in
statistics. Just as correlation is not causation, “significant” does not
mean “important” or even “relevant.” A “significant” effect is one
whose p-value—or probability of resulting from pure chance—is less
than a certain specified value. Accordingly, it can still be tiny and/or
causally irrelevant.
In fact, data mining can even extract highly “significant” correlations
that “explain” a set of randomly generated dependent variables using a
set of randomly generated independent variables. The three studies
Patterson mentions do indeed use data-mining techniques to, as he
says, develop polygenic indices for “educational attainment” and to
make various weak correlations of the latter with the former. Of
course, we never disputed that such studies do this; as we said in our
review, the field of sociogenomics is devoted to creating statistical
correlations between social outcomes according to various
interpretive definitions and aggregates of up to many thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Our point is that there’s no reason
to think these statistical correlations have any causal meaning.
Patterson writes that our criticisms “would invalidate an enormous
amount of modern genetics.” Again, we won’t interrogate what he
means by “enormous,” but will just assure readers that our review of
The Genetic Lottery is not meant to invalidate modern genetics. For
some physical traits, such as height or body mass index, polygenic
scores are associated with a sizeable fraction of the variation. Even in
these cases, the traits are clearly environmentally malleable, and there
is no fact of the matter about how much of the variation is due to
genetics versus environmental factors, as Richard Lewontin showed,
because of the interaction between the two. Therefore, we would

https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/06/09/why-biology-is-not-destiny-an-exchange/

8/10

24/03/2025, 11:15

‘Why Biology Is Not Destiny’: An Exchange | Kathryn Paige Harden, M.W. Feldman, Jessica Riskin, et al. | The New York Review of Books

indeed question any claim to show specifically genetic causes of such
traits on the basis of polygenic scores. Happily, such claims constitute
what we would judge to be a less than enormous portion of the field.
Finally, Patterson is incredulous that we would question the idea of a
polygenic score following a bell-shaped curve, writing that “the score
is a sum of small values mostly independent and any geneticist, or
statistician, will expect the distribution to be approximately normal.”
He says that only someone incompetent or ignorant of statistics could
deny this. But our point is ontological, not statistical. The question is
not whether a sum of small, independent values would be likely to
follow a normal distribution. The question is whether there’s any
reason to think such a sum can bear a meaningful relation to
cognitive, psychological, social, or behavioral aspects of people.
Here’s an example to illustrate what we mean: we find some letterwriters to The New York Review to be cogent while others are
tendentious. No doubt, given the right genetic database and using our
definitions of cogent and tendentious letter-writing, we could produce
polygenic scores for each, made up of many independent variables. On
that basis, a competent statistician might expect the distributions of
cogent and tendentious letter-writers to the The New York Review of
Books to be bell-shaped. But such a score would be a fabrication with
no causal meaning and would not help to explain the occurrence of
tendentious letters to the editor.

V

ictor Reus invokes the rare disease Williams-Beuren syndrome,
which has a known and relatively simple genetic cause. There is

no doubt that even simple genetic abnormalities may cause many
phenotypic consequences; this is called pleiotropy. But this is a very
different situation, even something like the opposite situation, from
what the authors of polygenic scores are claiming. In Williams-Beuren
and other such syndromes, differences or deletions in one area in the
genome cause many effects throughout the body. Conversely, the
authors of polygenic scores claim that aggregates of tiny differences
throughout the genome have specific effects on complex phenotypes.
Polygenic risk scores therefore do not “[unravel] complex behavioral
phenotypes into component parts.” Rather, they associate complex
behavioral phenotypes with aggregates of thousands of singlenucleotide differences. Moreover, genome-wide association studies of
social-behavioral phenomena such as “educational attainment”
associate only a tiny fraction of the variation among individuals with
single-nucleotide differences, and there is no reason to think these
differences are causal.
Henry Schlinger raises an important point, not only for human
behavioral traits but for evolution in general. Richard Lewontin

An intelligent approach?

Intelligence, you see, is a scientific journal that publishes studies that make “a

that most of the editorial board has resigned in protest at the appointment of the new
editor(s), but since that report appeared on a far-right website, Feedback is disinclined
to believe it without further evidence.
Hang on, readers may be thinking. How did we get from a scientific journal replacing
its editors to a far-right website? The thing is, intelligence research has sometimes
been misused to justify claims of racial superiority, especially during the eugenics
movement of the early 20th century. And Intelligence has published research that your
racist uncle might quote approvingly.

If this all sounds like something from the bad old days of Victorian science, Feedback

Forty lashes
New Scientist reporter Karmela Padavic-Callaghan highlights a paper

🔗

https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1068899? about why eyelashes are curly,
which they describe as “silly enough to be Feedback material”. Rude: this is a deeply
serious column about serious things.
The research is mostly about the physics of eyelashes, explaining how they transfer
water away from our eyes so we can still see when it is raining. This process depends
on “a hydrophobic curved flexible fiber array with surface micro-ratchet and macrocurvature”. There is a lot of stuff about adhesion forces and the importance of the
curvature of the lashes for water drainage.
And then we get to the discussion section where, as Karmela drily notes, “the authors
go into aesthetic advice”. You see, “modern beauty standards” encourage women to
use mascara “to extend and fix eyelashes”, which “compromises the protective
functions”. But fear not, the solution is at hand: “as a tip, for people with sparse
eyelashes, hydrophobic curved false eyelashes could offer a practical solution for
enhancing appearance while preserving eye protection.” Could a patent possibly be
pending?
Feedback wonders whether the authors have any advice for middle-aged writers whose
eyebrows grow too long, causing them to look like a macaroni penguin unless
regularly trimmed. For a friend.

A Stanford professor says science shows free will doesn’t
exist. Here’s why he’s mistaken

It seems like we have free will. Most of the time, we are the ones who choose what we eat, how we tie
our shoelaces and what articles we read on The Conversation.
However, the latest book by Stanford neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky, Determined: A Science of Life
Without Free Will, has been receiving a lot of media attention for arguing science shows this is an
illusion.

A Stanford professor says science shows free will doesn’t exist. Here’s why he’s mistaken

Sapolsky’s book was published in October 2023. Wikimedia

Sapolsky summarises the latest scientific research relevant to determinism: the idea that we’re
causally “determined” to act as we do because of our histories – and couldn’t possibly act any other
way.
According to determinism, just as a rock that is dropped is determined to fall due to gravity, your
neurons are determined to fire a certain way as a direct result of your environment, upbringing,
hormones, genes, culture and myriad other factors outside your control. And this is true regardless of
how “free” your choices seem to you.
Sapolsky also says that because our behaviour is determined in this way, nobody is morally
responsible for what they do. He believes while we can lock up murderers to keep others safe, they
technically don’t deserve to be punished.
This is quite a radical position. It’s worth asking why only 11% of philosophers agree with Sapolsky,
compared with the 60% who think being causally determined is compatible with having free will and
being morally responsible.

A Stanford professor says science shows free will doesn’t exist. Here’s why he’s mistaken

Have these “compatibilists” failed to understand the science? Or has Sapolsky failed to understand
free will?

meaningless void

Is determinism incompatible with free will?
“Free will” and “responsibility” can mean a variety of different things depending on how you approach
them.
Many people think of free will as having the ability to choose between alternatives. Determinism
might seem to threaten this, because if we are causally determined then we lack any real choice
between alternatives; we only ever make the choice we were always going to make.
But there are counterexamples to this way of thinking. For instance, suppose when you started
reading this article someone secretly locked your door for 10 seconds, preventing you from leaving the
room during that time. You, however, had no desire to leave anyway because you wanted to keep
reading – so you stayed where you are. Was your choice free?
Many would argue even though you lacked the option to leave the room, this didn’t make your choice
to stay unfree. Therefore, lacking alternatives isn’t what decides whether you lack free will. What
matters instead is how the decision came about.
The trouble with Sapolsky’s arguments, as free will expert John Martin Fischer explains, is he doesn’t
actually present any argument for why his conception of free will is correct.
He simply defines free will as being incompatible with determinism, assumes this absolves people of
moral responsibility, and spends much of the book describing the many ways our behaviours are
determined. His arguments can all be traced back to his definition of “free will”.
Compatibilists believe humans are agents. We live lives with “meaning”, have an understanding of
right and wrong, and act for moral reasons. This is enough to suggest most of us, most of the time,
have a certain type of freedom and are responsible for our actions (and deserving of blame) – even if
our behaviours are “determined”.
Compatibilists would point out that being constrained by determinism isn’t the same as being
constrained to a chair by a rope. Failing to save a drowning child because you were tied up is not the
same as failing to save a drowning child because you were “determined” not to care about them. The
former is an excuse. The latter is cause for condemnation.

Incompatibilists must defend themselves better

A Stanford professor says science shows free will doesn’t exist. Here’s why he’s mistaken

Some readers sympathetic to Sapolsky might feel unconvinced. They might say your decision to stay
in the room, or ignore the child, was still caused by influences in your history that you didn’t control –
and therefore you weren’t truly free to choose.
However, this doesn’t prove that having alternatives or being “undetermined” is the only way we can
count as having free will. Instead, it assumes they are. From the compatibilists’ point of view, this is
cheating.
A path in a forest splits off to both sides.
Compatibilists believe humans are agents who act for moral reasons. Shutterstock

Compatibilists and incompatibilists both agree that, given determinism is true, there is a sense in
which you lack alternatives and could not do otherwise.
However, incompatibilists will say you therefore lack free will, whereas compatibilists will say you still
possess free will because that sense of “lacking alternatives” isn’t what undermines free will – and free
will is something else entirely.
They say as long as your actions came from you in a relevant way (even if “you” were “determined” by
other things), you count as having free will. When you’re tied up by a rope, the decision to not save the
drowning child doesn’t come from you. But when you just don’t care about the child, it does.
By another analogy, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around, one person may say no auditory
senses are present, so this is incompatible with sound existing. But another person may say even
though no auditory senses are present, this is still compatible with sound existing because “sound”
isn’t about auditory perception – it’s about vibrating atoms.
Both agree nothing is heard, but disagree on what factors are relevant to determining the existence of
“sound” in the first place. Sapolsky needs to show why his assumptions about what counts as free will
are the ones relevant to moral responsibility. As philosopher Daniel Dennett once put it, we need to
ask which “varieties of free will [are] worth wanting”.

Free will isn’t a scientific question
The point of this back and forth isn’t to show compatibilists are right. It is to highlight there’s a
nuanced debate to engage with. Free will is a thorny issue. Showing nobody is responsible for what
they do requires understanding and engaging with all the positions on offer. Sapolsky doesn’t do this.
Sapolsky’s broader mistake seems to be assuming his questions are purely scientific: answered by
looking just at what the science says. While science is relevant, we first need some idea of what free
will is (which is a metaphysical question) and how it relates to moral responsibility (a normative
question). This is something philosophers have been interrogating for a very long time.

Interdisciplinary work is valuable and scientists are welcome to contribute to age-old philosophical
questions. But unless they engage with existing arguments first, rather than picking a definition they
like and attacking others for not meeting it, their claims will simply be confused.

Reviewed:
Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology, and Human Nature
by R.C. Lewontin and Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin
Pantheon, 322 pp., $21.95

Cat Island in the Bahamas maintains a declining population of one
thousand or so by slash-and-burn agriculture. Few of the one-room
houses have electricity; none has plumbing. The local teacher, a British
expatriate, told me that in seven years only one child had managed to
win entrance into the two-year program at the College of the Bahamas
in Nassau—and that she had flunked out. When I asked why, he gave a
perfectly obvious and reasonable answer: how can Cat Island children
maintain any interest or time for studies? They come home late in the
afternoon; they have to haul water, care for the goats, help to prepare
food. After dinner, they have no place (or light) for doing homework. I
nodded in evident agreement, but his next statement startled me (this,
I should add, was a casual barroom conversation; he knew me only as
a peculiar snail collector, not as author of The Mismeasure of Man). We
now know, he said, that only 20 percent of mental ability is
environmental; 80 percent is inherited, so these immediate factors can
explain, at most, one-fifth of the under-achievement. The rest must be
genetic, probably caused (he opined) by inbreeding among the few
families that inhabit Cat Island.
Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister of Singapore, has raised a furor in
that distant land by suggesting that the genetic stock of his nation is
about to plummet. He studied his census figures and noted a trend
common to all developed nations: highly educated women are having
fewer children than women with little schooling. Although this fact
usually (and correctly) inspires no action beyond a call for more
education (both for its intrinsic merits and for its salutary impact upon
population), Lee gave the argument a discredited eugenic twist that
has not been heard for the past half century or so: uneducated women
are genetically inferior in intelligence and their likeminded offspring
will swamp the smaller pool of intrinsically bright children born of
educated parents. Lee acknowledged that environment and upbringing
can influence both access and success in education, but we now know,
he continued, that 80 percent of intelligence is fixed by inheritance,
and only 20 percent malleable by circumstance. “A person’s
performance,” Lee stated, “depends on nature and nurture. There is
increasing evidence that nature, or what is inherited, is the greater
determinant of a person’s performance than nurture (or education and

percent is nature, or inherited, and 20 percent the differences from
different environment and upbringing.”

T

he fallacies of this and other hereditarian arguments about
complex human social behaviors have been so thoroughly

rehearsed that scholars might be tempted to treat any new discussion
with undisguised boredom. In the case of IQ, estimates of heritability
are a confusing mess, ranging from the notorious 80 percent, long
cited by Jensen and based originally upon the faked research data of
Sir Cyril Burt, to Leon Kamin’s argument that existing evidence does
not preclude an actual value of zero. In any case, and much more
importantly, heritability, as a technical term, simply doesn’t bear its
vernacular meaning of “inevitability”—the essential component of the
argument’s public use, as my two initial examples indicate. Heritability
is not a measure of flexibility, but a statement about how much
variation for traits within populations can be attributed to genetic
differences among individuals. Some visual impairments are nearly
100 percent heritable, but easily corrected with a pair of eyeglasses.
Whatever its status on our campuses (where confusion and
obfuscation are, as usual, by no means absent), the crudest,
discredited hereditarian argument about IQ still influences and
restricts the lives of millions. So long as teachers on tiny islands and
prime ministers of major nations act upon their belief that 80 percent
of intelligence is fixed in the genes, human potential will be sacrificed
on an altar of misunderstanding. Biological determinism is,
fundamentally, a theory of limits.
For these reasons, Not in Our Genes is an important and timely book,
for it not only exposes the fallacies of biological determinism (a field
perhaps well enough plowed)1 but also presents a positive view of
human behavior that could propel us past the stupefying sterility of
nature-nurture arguments. A proper understanding of biology and
culture both affirms the great importance of biology in human
behavior and also explains why biology makes us free. The old
equation of biology with restriction, with the given (as opposed to the
malleable) side of the false dichotomy between nature and nurture,
rests upon errors of thinking as old as Western culture itself. The
critics of biological determinism do not uphold the equally fallacious
(and equally cruel and restrictive) view that human culture cancels
biology. Biological determinism has limited the lives of millions by
misidentifying their socioeconomic disadvantages as inborn
deficiencies, but cultural determinism can be just as cruel in
attributing severe congenital diseases, autism for example, to
psychobabble about too much parental love, or too little.

unusually honest self-analysis by its authors of the reasons for their
concern. This frankness can lead us beyond the conventional set of
self-serving myths to a better understanding of how good scientists
work. Richard Lewontin, Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin bring a
comprehensive range of expertise to their subject. Lewontin is a
population geneticist and author of a recent book on the causes and
meaning of human diversity; Rose works in the neurosciences and has
written many fine analyses of the relationship between brain structure
and human behavior; Kamin, a psychologist, first exposed the fakery
of Sir Cyril Burt and wrote an important account of the history and
meaning of IQ tests.2
Amid this diversity, the authors share (with this reviewer, I must add
in good conscience) a definite and frankly stated perspective on
biological determinism in particular and on the social function of
science in general. They write in their preface:
Each of us has been engaged for much of this time in research, writing,
speaking, teaching, and public political activity in opposition to the
oppressive forms in which determinist ideology manifests itself. We share
a commitment to the prospect of the creation of a more socially just—a
socialist—society. And we recognize that a critical science is an integral
part of the struggle to create that society, just as we also believe that the
social function of much of today’s science is to hinder the creation of that
society by acting to preserve the interests of the dominant class, gender,
and race.

The traditional and unthinking response to such frankness by
scientists is outright dismissal of any subsequent statement on
grounds of prima facie bias. After all, isn’t science supposed to be a
cool, passionless, absolutely objective exploration of an external
reality? As T.H. Huxley said in his famous letter to Charles Kingsley, so
often taken out of context and misinterpreted in just this naive light,
Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every
preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss
nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.3

B

ut we scientists are no different from anyone else. We are

passionate human beings, enmeshed in a web of personal and
social circumstances. Our field does recognize canons of procedure
designed to give nature the long shot of asserting itself in the face of
such biases, but unless scientists understand their hopes and engage
in vigorous self-scrutiny, they will not be able to sort unacknowledged
preference from nature’s weak and imperfect message. As Herbert
Butterfield wrote in his great essay, The Whig Interpretation of History:

The historian may be cynical with Gibbon or sentimental with Carlyle; he
may have religious ardor or he may be a humanist…. It is not a sin in a
historian to introduce a personal bias that can be recognized and
discounted. The sin in historical composition is the organization of the
story in such a way that bias cannot be recognized.

An overtly expressed political commitment does not debar a scientist
from viewing nature accurately—if only because no honest scientist or
effective political activist would be foolish enough to advance a
program in evident discord with the world as we find it. Many facts of
nature are decidedly unpleasant—the certainty of our bodily death
prominently among them—but no social system fails to incorporate
these data (despite a plethora of palliations, from reincarnation to
resurrection, advocated by many cultures).

T

he proper relationship between nature and the personal and
social lives of those who study it lies in a venerable distinction

long advocated by logical positivism—the difference between “context
of discovery” and “context of justification.” If you wish to know why
Lewontin and not geneticist X reached a certain conclusion or why he
did so in 1984 and not in 1944—all questions about context of
discovery—then examine psychohistory and socioeconomic
circumstances. But “truth value”—or context of justification—is a
different matter. People reach conclusions for the damnedest of
peculiar reasons: pure guesses inspired by poetry dimly remembered
during a dream have sometimes turned out to be true, while
conclusions meticulously reached by conscious and repeated
experiment may be wrong.
Leftist scientists are more likely to combat biological determinism just
as rightists tend to favor this quintessential justification of the status
quo as intractable biology; the correlations are not accidental. But let
us not be so disrespectful of thought that we dismiss the logic of
arguments as nothing but an inevitable reflection of biases—a
confusion of context of discovery with context of justification. If we
thought that biological determinism was pernicious but correct, we
would live with it as we cope with the fact of our impending death. We
have campaigned vigorously against it because we regard determinist
arguments primarily as bad biology—and only then as devices used to
support dubious politics.
Not in Our Genes is an analysis of determinist argument from a definite
point of view; it is not a political diatribe. It begins with several
chapters on the historical origin and social utility of claims that
inequalities among races, classes, and sexes reflect the differential
genetic worthiness of individuals so sorted. Subsequent chapters
analyze the details of major contemporary arguments in the
determinist mode: IQ, patriarchy, the attribution of social pathology
among the poor and dispossessed to diseased brains, schizophrenia

Biology versus Old Ideology,” presents a positive view of a proper and
inextricable relationship between biology and culture.

T

he second major strength of Not in Our Genes lies in its attempt to

progress beyond debunking by providing a useful model of how
biology creates and interacts with culture (which then creates and
interacts with biology). Lewontin, who ought to know since he serves
as a volunteer fireman in southern Vermont, laments that fighting
biological determinism is like putting out fires. Every time you
extinguish one, another starts somewhere else. No sooner have you
discredited Carleton Coon’s theory of the parallel and separate origins
of human races from different stocks of Homo erectus (with blacks
making the last transition and therefore still lagging behind) than
Robert Ardrey writes a colorful book about the origin of human
violence in the territoriality of carnivorous Australopithecus, the killer
ape. So you show that Australopithecus was predominantly a herbivore.
Then William Shockley argues that IQ declines among American
blacks in direct proportion to the percent of their African heritage
(and also proposes that we pay a voluntary sterilization bonus scaled
to the extent of this measured deficit). By now you’re exhausted; you
never want to slide down that damned fire pole again. But the authors
of Not in Our Genes breathe deeply, and attempt a positive formulation.
The straw man set up in response to biological determinism is the
caricature of cultural determinism, the tabula rasa in its pure form.
Although biological determinists often like to intimate, for rhetorical
effect, that their opponents hold such a view, no serious student of
human behavior denies the potent influence of evolved biology upon
our cultural lives. Our struggle is to figure out how biology affects us,
not whether it does.
The first level of sophisticated argument that goes beyond crude
nature-nurture dichotomies is “interactionism”—the idea that
everything we do is influenced by both biology and culture, and that
our task is to divide the totality into a measured percentage due to
each. In fact, this kind of interactionism is the position of most
biological determinists, who love to argue that they are not crude 100
percenters of pure naturism (of course they are not: just as no one is
quite so stupid as to nullify biology completely, so too does no one
deny some flexibility in the translation of genes into complex
behaviors). Biological determinists hide behind the screen of
interactionism, complain bitterly that they have been maligned, and
that they do, after all, acknowledge the importance and independence
of culture. They then allot the percentages so that genes control what
really matters—80 percent determinism, after all, is usually good

enough for the cause. On this model, antideterminists are the folks
who do the parceling out differently and grant only a few percent to
the genes.
But, as Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin emphasize in the main theme of
their book, interactionism is also based on deep fallacies and cultural
biases that play into the hands of biological determinism. This
mechanical brand of interactionism still separates biology and culture;
it still views genes as primary, deep, and real, and culture as superficial
and superimposed. Genes are our inherited essence, culture the
epiphenomenal tinkering.
The chief fallacy, they argue (I think correctly), is reductionism—that
style of thinking associated with Descartes and the bourgeois
revolution, with its emphasis on individuality and the analysis of
wholes in terms of the underlying properties of their parts.

W

e must, they argue, go beyond reductionism to a holistic
recognition that biology and culture interpenetrate in an

inextricable manner. One is not given, and the other built upon it.
Although stomping dinosaurs cannot make continents drift,
organisms do create and shape their environment; they are not billiard
balls passively buffeted about by the pool cues of natural selection.
Individuals are not real and primary, with collectivities (including
societies and cultures) merely constructed from their accumulated
properties. Cultures make individuals too; neither comes first, neither
is more basic. You can’t add up the attributes of individuals and derive
a culture from them.
Thus, we cannot factor a complex social situation into so much
biology on one side, and so much culture on the other. We must seek
to understand the emergent and irreducible properties arising from an
inextricable interpenetration of genes and environments. In short, we
must use what so many great thinkers call, but American fashion
dismisses as political rhetoric from the other side, a dialectical
approach.
Dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western
scholars, not discarded because some nations of the second world
have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine.
The issues that it raises are, in another form, the crucial questions of
reductionism versus holism, now so much under discussion
throughout biology (where reductionist accounts have reached their
limits and further progress demands new approaches to process
existing data, not only an accumulation of more information).
When presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as
dogmatic precepts true by fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics—
as reflected in the analyses of this book—embody a holistic vision that
views change as interaction among components of complete systems,

and sees the components themselves not as a priori entities, but as
both products of and inputs to the system. Thus the law of
“interpenetrating opposites” is about inextricable interdependence of
components: that of “transformation of quantity to quality” about a
systems-based view of change that translates incremental inputs into
alterations of state; and that of “negation of negation” about the
direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert
exactly to previous states.

W

ith so much good to say about the substance of this book, I
regret to report that it suffers greatly from deficiencies in style.

The old cliché about camels being horses built by committees has a
ring of truth (although camels are really quite competent creatures in
their own right, our aesthetic sensibilities notwithstanding)—and the
King James Bible remains the only decent work of literature ever
assembled by a group. Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin create an admirable
unity in belief, but their prose styles couldn’t be more different—and
does it ever show. The book is a hodge-podge, a maddening collection
of unintegrated insights. Lewontin writes beautiful, sometimes
sweeping prose, but often with an almost magisterial inattention to
detail. Kamin, on the other hand, is a master of the microscope—and a
formidable hatchet man against determinist illogic. I just couldn’t
depress my intellectual clutch fast enough to accept the juxtaposition
of his minute statistical analyses of IQ and schizophrenia with
Lewontin’s generalizations about the history of biological determinism
from Domesday to Descartes to David Barash. As for Rose, well, as my
grandma would have said: the ideas, they’re fine, but oy, those big
words. At one point, I felt that if I read the word “legitimate” (used as a
verb) just one more time, I would simply dissolve in tears. In this case,
a good editor would have made a great book.
Still, the subject is too important, and the arguments too incisive, to let
a matter of style deter a reading of this book. Lewontin, Rose, and
Kamin are calling for no less than a revolution in philosophy. They are
also not unmindful of that oldest chestnut in the Marxist pantheon,
the last thesis on Feuerbach: philosophers thus far have only
interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change
it.

Can you choose to believe something, just like that?

Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Fort Lewis College

Some years ago, I was in a lively conversation with a software developer about arguments for and
against God’s existence. After discussing their merits and shortcomings, he paused – perhaps a little
impatiently – and said, “You know, these arguments really don’t matter that much. I choose to believe
in God. Believing is so valuable for my life.”
But is that how belief works – can you simply choose to believe?
People can, of course, choose to read certain sources, spend time with certain groups, or reflect on a
certain matter – all of which influence their beliefs. But all of these choices involve evidence of some
kind. We often choose which evidence to expose ourselves to, but the evidence itself seems to be in the
driver’s seat in causing beliefs.

Can you choose to believe something, just like that?

For much of the past 2,000 years, philosophers would have been perfectly comfortable with the
software developer’s claim that belief is a matter of choice. A long line of distinguished thinkers –
from the Stoic philosopher Epictetus and Saint Augustine of Hippo to French rationalist René
Descartes and early feminist Mary Astell have held that people can exercise at least some control over
their beliefs.
Over the past half-century, however, “doxastic voluntarism” – the idea that belief is under the control
of the will – has been widely rejected. Most current philosophers don’t think people can immediately
believe something “just like that,” simply because they want to. What beliefs someone ends up having
are determined by the people and environments they are exposed to – from beliefs about a deity to
beliefs about the solar system.
As a philosophy professor myself, I’ve dedicated years of reflection to this issue. I’ve come to think
both camps get something right.

Reflecting reality
Some philosophers think that the nature of belief itself ensures that people cannot just choose what to
believe.
They argue that beliefs have a “truth-aim” built into them: that is, beliefs characteristically represent
reality. And sadly, reality often does not obey our wishes and desires; we cannot just decide to think
reality is a certain way.
No matter how much I may want to be 6 feet, 8 inches tall, reality will faithfully imprint it upon my
consciousness that I am 5'11" every time I glance in the mirror or make an appearance on the
basketball court. Were I to resolve to believe that I am 6'8", I would quickly find that such resolutions
are wholly ineffective.

Can you choose to believe something, just like that?

Or consider another example. If belief were truly voluntary, I would gladly relinquish my belief that
climate change is afoot – imagine how less worried I’d be. But I cannot. The evidence, along with the
widespread agreement among scientific authorities, has indelibly impressed upon my mind that
climate change is part of reality.
Regardless of whether I want to believe or not believe, bare desire isn’t enough to make it happen.
Beliefs seem largely outside of our direct control.

Who’s responsible?
But if that’s true, some rather alarming consequences seem to follow. It seems we had better stop
blaming people for their beliefs, no matter how far-fetched.
Suppose I believe a dangerous falsehood: that Bill Gates used the COVID-19 vaccine to implant
microchips in people, or that climate change is a hoax, or that the Holocaust is an elaborate
fabrication. If belief is involuntary, it looks as though I am innocent of any wrongdoing. These beliefs
just happened to me, so to speak. If beliefs are not voluntary, then they seem the spontaneous result
of my being exposed to certain influences and ideas – including, in this case, conspiracy theory chat
forums.
Now, people can choose what influences they allow into their lives – to some extent. I can decide
where to gather information about climate trends: a chat forum, the mainstream media, or the United
Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I can decide how much to reflect on what such
sources tell me, along with their motivations. Almost all contemporary philosophers think that people
can exert this type of voluntary control over their beliefs.

books and an open laptop at an indoor table.
We make choices about what evidence to look at – but even those choices are shaped by external
influences. Maskot/Getty Images

But does that mean I am responsible for the beliefs I arrive at? Not necessarily.
After all, which sources we decide to consult, and how we evaluate them, can also be shaped by our
preexisting beliefs. I am not going to trust the U.N. climate panel’s latest report if, say, I believe it is a
part of a global conspiracy to curtail free markets – especially not if I had many similar beliefs
drummed into me since childhood.
It gets difficult to see how individuals could have any meaningful freedom over their beliefs, or any
meaningful responsibility.

The murky middle
Research has led me to think that things are a bit less grim – and a bit less black and white.

Can you choose to believe something, just like that?

Philosopher Elizabeth Jackson and I recently carried out a study, not yet published, involving more
than 300 participants. We gave them brief summaries of several scenarios where it was unclear
whether an individual had committed a crime.
The evidence was ambiguous, but we asked participants whether they could choose to believe the
individual was innocent “just like that,” without having to gather evidence or think critically. Many
people in the study said that they could do exactly this.
It’s possible they were mistaken. Still, several recent studies at the intersection of philosophy and
psychology suggest people can control some of their beliefs, especially in situations where the
evidence is ambiguous.
And that describes many of the most important propositions people are forced to consider, from
politics and careers to romance: Who is the best candidate? Which path should I pursue? Is she the
one?
So, it looks like we have some reason to think people are able to directly control their beliefs, after all.
And if the evidence for God is similarly ambiguous, perhaps my software developer was right that he
could decide to believe.

Determined: Life Without Free Will by Robert
Sapolsky review – the hard science of decisions
The behavioural scientist engagingly lays out the reasons why our
every action is predetermined – and why we shouldn’t despair about it

T

he philosophical debate on free will has a way of blowing people’s minds
when they first encounter it. And fair enough: thinkers who deny the
existence of free will insist that nobody ever meaningfully chooses what
they do. Earlier this week, for example, walking past a cafe, I stopped to
buy a coffee, and certainly it felt as if I could have chosen otherwise. Nobody forced
me inside at gunpoint, and I’m not enslaved to an overpowering caffeine addiction. I
just wanted coffee. But hold on: that desire, and the bodily movements involved in
the purchase, were caused by events in my brain. And what caused them? Prior
brain events, interacting with my environment. My brain itself, for that matter, is
only the way it is because of my genes and upbringing, both of which resulted from
the chance meeting of my parents – and so on, in an unbroken chain of causes, back
to the big bang.

If our actions are “determined” in this way, the moral implications are dizzying. It
becomes hard to see how to blame a Harold Shipman or Charles Manson – or a
Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump – for anything they do. If I’d been born with
Shipman’s exact genes, and experienced his precise upbringing, I’d simply have
been him; there’s no secret corner of my psyche where a ghostly “free will” lurks,
capable of making better decisions. (I’m ignoring randomness in quantum physics
here, in the interests of my sanity; you’ll have to take my word for it that few freewill theorists think it makes much difference.)

Everything is luck,
including whether or not you
have the right character traits
for dealing with bad luck

Perhaps because denying free will feels so
counterintuitive – while talk of inner ghosts is
plainly unscientific – a majority of philosophers
are “compatibilists”. They believe our actions are
in fact determined, but that we nonetheless have
free will. In a free-will sceptic such as me, this is apt to prompt murmurings about
having one’s cake and eating it. But the compatibilists do have a point: if you want a
coffee, and nothing stops you from getting one – you can afford it, the cafe’s open,
etc – then in what sense is your purchase not freely made? Because you didn’t
choose to want coffee in the first place? But to meet that definition of freedom,
you’d have to be free not to want what in fact you do want. Which is a very strange
notion indeed.
Into this bewildering terrain steps the celebrated behavioural scientist Robert
Sapolsky, who sets out in Determined to banish free will once and for all – and to
show that confronting its nonexistence needn’t condemn us to amorality or despair.
It’s only one aspect of the book’s strangeness that he does this in a style that often
calls to mind a hugely knowledgable yet stoned west coast slacker. (I’m still
recovering from his reaction, in a book crammed with footnotes and diagrams of
motor neurons, to the conclusion that we don’t control our lives: “Fuck. That really
blows.”)

His strategy is an ambitious one: to track every link of the causal chain that
culminates in human behaviour, starting with what’s happening in the brain in the
final few milliseconds before we act, all the way back to how our brains are shaped
by early experiences, and even before that, all mostly at the fine-grained level of
neurotransmitters and genes.

Along the way, he makes impassioned arguments against such ideas as “grit”, which
seem to suggest that those raised in situations that tax their willpower could just
choose to develop more of it. Yes, there are people who “overcame bad luck with
spectacular tenacity and grit” – but their capacity for tenacity and grit was bestowed
by luck, too. Everything is luck, including whether or not you have the right
character traits for dealing with bad luck. In the words of the free-will sceptic Galen
Strawson, “luck swallows everything”.
Determined is a bravura performance, well worth reading for the pleasure of
Sapolsky’s deeply informed company. What’s less clear is whether this inventory of
the causes of human behaviour should change anyone’s position on free will. After
all, most free-will deniers make their case on a priori grounds, meaning that their
arguments aren’t dependent on specific scientific findings. If the entire present state
of the world was caused by the entire state of the world just before that, and the
world back then was caused by the state of the world before that, and so on, then
the details of exactly what’s causing what don’t seem to matter.
Meanwhile, compatibilists, by definition, have already made their peace with the
idea that everything is fully caused, and insist it’s no threat to free will. So
Sapolsky’s insistence that everything is really, really fully caused seems unlikely to
trouble them. Perhaps there are people who believe free will hides out in some part
of the brain not yet charted by scientists. If so, this book will set them right. But in
philosophy, at least, that isn’t a common view.
Maybe it is a subliminal awareness of these issues that explains Sapolsky’s tic of
informing the reader how much he disliked writing large chunks of the book.
“Giving this section this ridiculous heading reflects how unenthused I am about
having to write this next stretch,” he writes at one point. About 170 pages later: “I
really do not want to write this chapter, or the next one.” To which another kind of
free-will denier may reply, well, maybe you needn’t have done. Once you’ve made
the basic case that there’s no space for free will, you’ve said it all.
Later in the book, when he turns to the question of how we should live in the
absence of free will, Sapolsky’s humane worldview comes to the fore. Some argue
that realising we lack freedom may turn us into moral monsters. But he makes a
moving case that, really, it’s a reason to live with profound forgiveness and
understanding – for seeing “the absurdity of hating any person for anything they’ve
done”. It is the ultimate philosophical grounding for the idea that “there but for the
grace of God go I”. A familiar paradox lurks here, as with any discussion of how we
ought to respond to the absence of free will: if there’s no free will, surely we’re just
going to respond however we respond? But this doesn’t mean Sapolsky’s absorbing
and compassionate book won’t change how people think, or how they behave
towards one another. It just means they won’t have freely chosen to make that
change.

Do criminals freely decide to commit offences? How the
courts decide

Lecturer in law, University of Sydney

Social media algorithms, artificial intelligence, and our own genetics are among the factors
influencing us beyond our awareness. This raises an ancient question: do we have control over our
own lives? This article is part of The Conversation’s series on the science of free will.

Are criminals responsible for their actions? It’s a question philosophers, criminologists and
jurisprudence experts have grappled with for centuries.
Some philosophers and scientists argue no-one has free will and no-one is ever responsible for any
crime, no matter how serious. They suggest the impact of genes and formative social environments on
us mean there’s no room left for free will.

Do criminals freely decide to commit offences? How the courts decide

This radical view, however, is not held by the majority of philosophers working on free will, nor is it
held by the courts.
The criminal justice system presupposes people generally are free to decide whether or not to engage
in criminal behaviour. If they do choose to commit a crime, it is presumed that they are responsible
for what they’ve done.
However, the courts acknowledge not everyone has free will. For example, those who are very young,
or sleepwalking, or severely mentally ill may not be held responsible for an offence. You might think
of these people as lacking free will because they are unable to reason properly about what to do.

criminals?

Fit to stand trial?
But even before getting to the question of whether a defendant in a criminal proceeding deserves to be
punished for an offence, there can be doubt about whether they are sufficiently rational to be tried at
all.
Though the law sees most defendants as able to properly participate in their trial, it recognises others
cannot.
A defendant’s mental condition may deprive them of the free will needed to properly instruct their
lawyers, present their version of events, or follow court proceedings.
This was one of the issues in relation to James Gargasoulas, who is currently serving at least 46 years
in prison for killing six people and injuring 27 others in Melbourne’s 2017 Bourke Street massacre.
The law acknowledges some may lack the kind of free will necessary to properly participate in their trial.
David Crosling/AAP

Gargasoulas’ actions in driving a car into a busy mall, and his conduct in the run-up to the trial, raised
significant questions about his mental health.
Expert witnesses were reportedly divided on whether Gargasoulas had the capacity to properly
participate in his trial, despite suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and delusions.
A psychiatrist for the defence said Gargasoulas’ delusional belief system “overwhelms him”; the
psychiatrist expressed concern Gargasoulas was using the court process as a platform to voice his
belief he is the messiah.
A second forensic psychiatrist agreed Gargasoulas was “not able to rationally enter a plea”.

However, a psychologist for the prosecution assessed him as fit and the prosecution argued there was
evidence from recorded phone calls that he was capable of rational thought.
Notwithstanding the opinion of the majority of expert witnesses, the jury found Gargasoulas was fit to
stand trial, and later he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Working from media reports, it is difficult to be sure precisely what happened in court, and we cannot
know why the jury favoured the evidence suggesting he was fit to stand trial. However, it is interesting
to consider whether research into the psychology of blame and punishment can shed any light on
their decision.

Questions of consequence
Some psychologists argue judgements of blame are not always based on a balanced assessment of free
will or rational control, as the law presumes. Sometimes we decide how much control or freedom a
person possessed based upon our automatic negative responses to harmful consequences.
As the psychologist Mark Alicke says:

we simply don’t want to excuse people who do horrible things, regardless of how disordered
their cognitive states may be.

When a person has done something very bad, we are motivated to look for evidence that supports
blaming them and to downplay evidence that might excuse them by showing that they lacked free will.
Were the jurors who found Gargasoulas fit to stand trial influenced by how horrendous his actions
were? Would their decision have been different had they not known what he’d been charged with?
We may never know. What is clear, though, is that questions about free will continue to challenge the
criminal justice system — and will likely continue to do so in the future.

As a society we believe that our political allegiance depends on which party best marries up with our
needs and values – and that these are shaped by our life experiences. But research with twins suggests
picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the
parties.
At the Department of Twin Research, which hosts TwinsUK, the biggest adult twin registry in the UK,
we recently performed a poll of voting preferences. The twins were all born in the UK and were
broadly representative of the UK population. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture
influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader
conclusions about people’s voting habits.

Do our genes tell us how to vote? Study of twins says they might

Twins provide a unique natural experiment for research. Identical twins share 100% of their genes,
while non-identical twins – like non-twin siblings – share about 50%. Both identical and nonidentical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. By comparing the differences
and similarities between them we can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic
predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. Because twin studies adjust for culture and
upbringing they are an ideal way to study political allegiances.
We analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March
2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 – most of whom were middle aged. They told us whether they
intended to vote, what their political party of choice was and provided their personal rating of the
main party leaders.
We found that voting Conservative (or not) is strongly influenced by genetics. When it came to voting
Tory, we found that 57% of the variability (differences or similarity) between people’s voting
preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. That means the identical
twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins – suggesting an underlying
genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors.
For UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51%. This was closely
followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48%.
That’s not quite how it works, Dave. Stefan Rousseau/PA

The exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by
environment, with no genetic influence. Identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in
preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. Geography also played a possible role – as voting
for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental.
These latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research, mainly carried out in
the US. A 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed
that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in
the identical twins than the fraternal twins.
Previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views – be they for or
against.
We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our
personalities. The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of
our underlying personalities.

Will you vote?
Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced
by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.

The question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses.
David Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50% heritability, followed by
Nick Clegg at 37%. Views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental.
Psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round
symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices.
But even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the
polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about
when you approach the ballot box.

Do we have free will – and do we want it? Thomas the Tank
Engine offers clues
Published: October 7, 2022 2.07am AEDT

Are we free or are our actions determined by the laws of physics? And how much free will do we
actually want? These questions have troubled philosophers for millennia – and there are still no
perfect answers.
But it turns out that a character from a children’s TV series can provide a clue. Thomas the Tank
Engine, despite being a locomotive, behaves like a human. He makes decisions and choices. And he is
morally responsible: when he does something wrong, he gets punished.
But look deeper and things become complicated. He is an engine. His movements are determined by
the shape of the tracks, the workings of his engine and the employees of the railway. So is his free will
just an illusion?

Do we have free will – and do we want it? Thomas the Tank Engine offers clues

Laws of physics explain how a past event results in a future one. For example, if I put a kettle on the
hob, the laws of thermodynamics determine that it will boil at a nearby point in the future. If I don’t
interfere with the kettle or the hob, there is only one outcome possible: the water will start boiling.
A powerful philosophical argument against free will states that since we cannot change the past and
since we cannot change the laws of physics, we cannot change the future either. This is because the
future is just a consequence of the past, and the laws of physics dictate that the past will result in the
future. The future is not open to alternatives.
This also applies to us: our bodies are physical objects made of atoms and molecules governed by laws
of physics. But every decision and action we take can ultimately be traced back to some initial
conditions at the beginning of the universe.
We might feel like we have free will, but that is just an illusion. And the same is the case for Thomas:
it might seem to him like he is free, but his actions are decided by the layout of the tracks and the
timetable of the railway. What he does is not open to alternatives. He is, after all, a steam engine
governed by the laws of thermodynamics.

Moral responsibility
But if Thomas’ actions are not open to alternatives, why is he told off when he gets things wrong? If he
were no more than a machine, would it make much sense to think he is morally responsible? After all,
it would be odd to say that my kettle deserves praise for boiling the water, if it really could not have
done otherwise.
The US philosopher Harry Frankfurt has developed an ingenious thought experiment to show that the
future does not have to be open to alternatives for us to be morally responsible. Imagine two agents,
let’s call them Killer and Controller. Controller has electrodes connected to the brain of Killer. If Killer
doesn’t do as Controller wants, he switches on the electrodes – forcing Killer to obey.
Now, Controller really wants someone, let’s call them Victim, to die. So he thinks of directing Killer to
kill Victim. But it turns out that Killer actually wants Victim to die as well, so she kills Victim without
Controller needing to intervene at all. The electrodes remain switched off.
Thomas Tank Engine.

What’s the moral of the story? Although Killer’s actions were not open to alternatives (if she decided
not to kill, Controller would have forced her to do so anyway), she is still responsible and punished as
a murderer.
It looks like Thomas is in the same situation: when he does things within the rules of the railway, he is
left to do them of his own volition. When he does not, someone intervenes: the driver, the conductor
or the ominous Fat Controller. But he is still reprimanded when things go wrong. The fact that his
actions are not open to alternatives does not change anything about that.

Do we have free will – and do we want it? Thomas the Tank Engine offers clues

How much free will is desirable?
So how about a universe where Thomas’ future is not determined? Would he be free there?
Although we are uncomfortable about the fact that our actions might be determined, the alternative
isn’t much better. A universe where the future is completely undetermined, where it is too open to
alternatives, is just too chaotic. I need to know that when I put the kettle on the hob, it will boil. A
universe where the water spontaneously turns into frozen orange juice isn’t one where most of us
would want to live.
And the same is true of Thomas. If Thomas was allowed to leave the tracks, fly off into the air, or if his
steam engine did not follow the laws of thermodynamics, his universe would not function.
His character captures our intuitions about free will. We need choice and moral responsibility, but we
do not want our actions to be completely undetermined. We want our free will to be somewhere
between full determinism and complete randomness.

Do You Have Free Will? Yes, It’s the Only Choice - The New York Times

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/science/22tier.html
FINDINGS

Do You Have Free Will? Yes, It’s the Only Choice
By John Tierney
March 21, 2011

Suppose that Mark and Bill live in a deterministic universe. Everything that happens this
morning — like Mark’s decision to wear a blue shirt, or Bill’s latest attempt to comb over
his bald spot — is completely caused by whatever happened before it.
If you recreated this universe starting with the Big Bang and let all events proceed
exactly the same way until this same morning, then the blue shirt is as inevitable as the
comb-over.
Now for questions from experimental philosophers:
1) In this deterministic universe, is it possible for a person to be fully morally responsible
for his actions?
2) This year, as he has often done in the past, Mark arranges to cheat on his taxes. Is he
fully morally responsible for his actions?
3) Bill falls in love with his secretary, and he decides that the only way to be with her is to
murder his wife and three children. Before leaving on a trip, he arranges for them to be
killed while he is away. Is Bill fully morally responsible for his actions?
To a classic philosopher, these are just three versions of the same question about free will.
But to the new breed of philosophers who test people’s responses to concepts like
determinism, there are crucial differences, as Shaun Nichols explains in the current issue
of Science.
Most respondents will absolve the unspecified person in Question 1 from full
responsibility for his actions, and a majority will also give Mark a break for his tax
chiseling. But not Bill. He’s fully to blame for his heinous crime, according to more than 70
percent of the people queried by Dr. Nichols, an experimental philosopher at the
University of Arizona, and his Yale colleague Joshua Knobe.
Is Bill being judged illogically? In one way, yes. The chain of reasoning may seem flawed
to some philosophers, and the belief in free will may seem naïve to the psychologists and
neuroscientists who argue that we’re driven by forces beyond our conscious control — an
argument that Bill’s lawyer might end up borrowing in court.

But in another way it makes perfect sense to hold Bill fully accountable for murder. His
judges pragmatically intuit that regardless of whether free will exists, our society
depends on everyone’s believing it does. The benefits of this belief have been
demonstrated in other research showing that when people doubt free will, they do worse
at their jobs and are less honest.
In one experiment, some people read a passage from Francis Crick, the molecular
biologist, asserting that free will is a quaint old notion no longer taken seriously by
intellectuals, especially not psychologists and neuroscientists. Afterward, when
compared with a control group that read a different passage from Crick (who died in
2004) these people expressed more skepticism about free will — and promptly cut
themselves some moral slack while taking a math test.
Asked to solve a series of arithmetic problems in a computerized quiz, they cheated by
getting the answers through a glitch in the computer that they’d been asked not to
exploit. The supposed glitch, of course, had been put there as a temptation by the
researchers, Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota and Jonathan Schooler of the
University of California, Santa Barbara.
In a follow-up experiment, the psychologists gave another test in which people were
promised $1 for every correct answer — and got to compile their own scores. Just as Dr.
Vohs and Dr. Schooler feared, people were more likely to cheat after being exposed
beforehand to arguments against free will. These people went home with more unearned
cash than did the other people.
This behavior in the lab, the researchers noted, squares with studies in recent decades
showing an increase in the number of college students who admit to cheating. During this
same period, other studies have shown a weakening in the popular belief in free will
(although it’s still widely held).

“Doubting one’s free will may undermine the sense of self as agent,” Dr. Vohs and Dr.
Schooler concluded. “Or, perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse
to behave as one likes.”
That could include goofing off on the job, according to another study done by Dr. Vohs
along with a team of psychologists led by Tyler F. Stillman of Southern Utah University.
They went to a day-labor employment agency armed with questionnaires for a sample of
workers to fill out confidentially.
These questionnaires were based on a previously developed research instrument called
the Free Will and Determinism Scale. The workers were asked how strongly they agreed
with statements like “Strength of mind can always overcome the body’s desires” or
“People can overcome any obstacles if they truly want to” or “People do not choose to be
in the situations they end up in — it just happens.”
The psychologists also measured other factors, including the workers’ general
satisfaction with their lives, how energetic they felt, how strongly they endorsed an ethic
of hard work. None of these factors was a reliable predictor of their actual performance
on the job, as rated by their supervisors. But the higher the workers scored on the scale of
belief in free will, the better their ratings on the job.

Do You Have Free Will? Yes, It’s the Only Choice - The New York Times

“Free will guides people’s choices toward being more moral and better performers,” Dr.
Vohs said. “It’s adaptive for societies and individuals to hold a belief in free will, as it
helps people adhere to cultural codes of conduct that portend healthy, wealthy and happy
life outcomes.”
Intellectual concepts of free will can vary enormously, but there seems to be a fairly
universal gut belief in the concept starting at a young age. When children age 3 to 5 see a
ball rolling into a box, they say that the ball couldn’t have done anything else. But when
they see an experimenter put her hand in the box, they insist that she could have done
something else.
That belief seems to persist no matter where people grow up, as experimental
philosophers have discovered by querying adults in different cultures, including Hong
Kong, India, Colombia and the United States. Whatever their cultural differences, people
tend to reject the notion that they live in a deterministic world without free will.
They also tend to agree, across cultures, that a hypothetical person in a hypothetically
deterministic world would not be responsible for his sins. This same logic explains why
they they’ll excuse Mark’s tax evasion, a crime that doesn’t have an obvious victim. But
that logic doesn’t hold when people are confronted with what researchers call a “highaffect” transgression, an emotionally upsetting crime like Bill’s murder of his family.
“It’s two different kinds of mechanisms in the brain,” said Alfred Mele, a philosopher at
Florida State University who directs the Big Questions in Free Will project. “If you give
people an abstract story and a hypothetical question, you’re priming the theory machine
in their head. But their theory might be out of line with their intuitive reaction to a
detailed story about someone doing something nasty. As experimenters have shown, the
default assumption for people is that we do have free will.”
At an abstract level, people seem to be what philosophers call incompatibilists: those who
believe free will is incompatible with determinism. If everything that happens is
determined by what happened before, it can seem only logical to conclude you can’t be
morally responsible for your next action.
But there is also a school of philosophers — in fact, perhaps the majority school — who
consider free will compatible with their definition of determinism. These compatibilists
believe that we do make choices, even though these choices are determined by previous
events and influences. In the words of Arthur Schopenhauer, “Man can do what he wills,
but he cannot will what he wills.”
Does that sound confusing — or ridiculously illogical? Compatibilism isn’t easy to
explain. But it seems to jibe with our gut instinct that Bill is morally responsible even
though he’s living in a deterministic universe. Dr. Nichols suggests that his experiment
with Mark and Bill shows that in our abstract brains we’re incompatibilists, but in our
hearts we’re compatibilists.

“This would help explain the persistence of the philosophical dispute over free will and
moral responsibility,” Dr. Nichols writes in Science. “Part of the reason that the problem of
free will is so resilient is that each philosophical position has a set of psychological
mechanisms rooting for it.”
Some scientists like to dismiss the intuitive belief in free will as an exercise in selfdelusion — a simple-minded bit of “confabulation,” as Crick put it. But these supposed
experts are deluding themselves if they think the question has been resolved. Free will
hasn’t been disproved scientifically or philosophically. The more that researchers
investigate free will, the more good reasons there are to believe in it.

Superdeterminism, a radical quantum hypothesis, says our “choices” are

quantum events; their apparent dependence on human observation, or
measurement; and the apparent ability of a measurement in one place to
determine, instantly, the outcome of a measurement elsewhere, an effect
called nonlocality.
Einstein, who derided nonlocality as “spooky action at a distance,” insisted
that quantum mechanics must be incomplete; there must be hidden variables
that the theory overlooks. Superdeterminism is a radical hidden-variables
theory proposed by physicist John Bell. He is renowned for a 1964 theorem,
now named after him, that dramatically exposes the nonlocality of quantum
mechanics.
Bell said in a BBC interview in 1985 that the puzzle of nonlocality vanishes if
you assume that “the world is superdeterministic, with not just inanimate
nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behavior,
including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather
than another, absolutely predetermined.”
In a recent video, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, whose work I admire, notes
that superdeterminism eliminates the apparent randomness of quantum
mechanics. “In quantum mechanics,” she explains, “we can only predict
probabilities for measurement outcomes, rather than the measurement
outcomes themselves. The outcomes are not determined, so quantum
mechanics is indeterministic. Superdeterminism returns us to determinism.”
“The reason we can’t predict the outcome of a quantum measurement,” she
explains, “is that we are missing information,” that is, hidden variables.
Superdeterminism, she notes, gets rid of the measurement problem and
nonlocality as well as randomness. Hidden variables determine in advance
how physicists carry out the experiments; physicists might think they are
choosing one option over another, but they aren’t. Hossenfelder calls free
will “logically incoherent nonsense.”

Hossenfelder predicts that physicists might be able to confirm
superdeterminism experimentally. “At some point,” she says, “it’ll just
become obvious that measurement outcomes are actually much more
predictable than quantum mechanics says. Indeed, maybe someone already
has the data, they just haven’t analyzed it the right way.” Hossenfelder
defends superdeterminism in more detail in a technical paper written with
physicist Tim Palmer.
Hossenfelder’s commitment to determinism puts her in good company.
Einstein, too, believed that specific causes must have specific, nonrandom
effects, and he doubted the existence of free will. He once wrote, “If the
moon, in the act of completing its eternal way around the earth, were gifted
with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was
traveling its way of its own accord.”
I’m nonetheless baffled by superdeterminism, whether explicated by
Hossenfelder or another prominent proponent, Nobel laureate Gerard
t’Hooft. When I read their arguments, I feel like I’m missing something. The
arguments seem circular: the world is deterministic, hence quantum
mechanics must be deterministic. Superdeterminism doesn’t specify what
the hidden variables of quantum mechanics are; it just decrees that they
exist, and that they specify everything that happens, including my decision
to write these words and your decision to read them.
Hossenfelder and I argued about free will in a conversation last summer. I
pointed out that we both made the choice to speak to each other; our choices
stem from “higher-level” psychological factors, such as our values and
desires, which are underpinned by but not reducible to physics. Physics can’t
account for choices and hence free will. So I said.
Invoking psychological causes “doesn’t make the laws of physics go away,”
Hossenfelder sternly informed me. “Everything is physics. You’re made of

particles.” I felt like we were talking past each other. To her, a
nondeterministic world makes no sense. To me, a world without choice
makes no sense.
Other physicists insist that physics provides ample room for free will.
George Ellis argues for “downward causation,” which means that physical
processes can lead to “emergent” phenomena, notably human desires and
intentions, that can in turn exert an influence over our physical selves.
Mathematicians John Conway and Simon Kochen go even further in their
2009 paper “The Strong Free Will Theorem.” They present a mathematical
argument, which resembles John Bell’s theorem on quantum nonlocality,
that we have free will because particles have free will.
To my mind, the debate over whether physics rules out or enables free will is
moot. It’s like citing quantum theory in a debate over whether the Beatles
are the best rock band ever (which they clearly are). Philosophers speak of
an “explanatory gap” between physical theories about consciousness and
consciousness itself. First of all, the gap is so vast that you might call it a
chasm. Second, the chasm applies not just to consciousness but to the entire
realm of human affairs.
Physics, which tracks changes in matter and energy, has nothing to say about
love, desire, fear, hatred, justice, beauty, morality, meaning. All these things,
viewed in the light of physics, could be described as “logically incoherent
nonsense,” as Hossenfelder puts it. But they have consequences; they alter
the world.
Physics as a whole, not just quantum mechanics, is obviously incomplete. As
philosopher Christian List told me recently, humans are “not just heaps of
interacting particles.” We are “intentional agents, with psychological
features and mental states” and the capacity to make choices. Physicists have
acknowledged the limits of their discipline. Philip Anderson, a Nobel

laureate, contends in his 1972 essay “More Is Different” that as phenomena
become more complicated, they require new modes of explanation; not even
chemistry is reducible to physics, let alone psychology.
Bell, the inventor of superdeterminism, apparently didn’t like it. He seems to
have viewed superdeterminism as a reductio ad absurdum proposition,
which highlights the strangeness of quantum mechanics. He wasn’t crazy
about any interpretations of quantum mechanics, once describing them as
“like literary fiction.”
Why does the debate over free will and superdeterminism matter? Because
ideas matter. At this time in human history, many of us already feel helpless,
at the mercy of forces beyond our control. The last thing we need is a theory
that reinforces our fatalism.

Has Quantum Physics Determined Your Future?
Everything in the universe may be preordained, according to physics

Does physics allow humans to make their own choices, or does it preordain our future? Prathan Chorruangsak/Getty Images
Quantum Physics

On the morning of June 28, 1914, a Bosnian Serb student named Gavrilo
Princip stood outside Moritz Schiller’s delicatessen near the Latin Bridge in
Sarajevo. Sometime after 10:45 A.M., a motorcade carrying archduke Franz
Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, passed within meters of

Princip, who drew his 0.38-caliber pistol and fired. One bullet struck the
archduke in the neck. He was rushed to the military governor’s residence for
medical treatment, but by 11:30 A.M. he was pronounced dead.
The assassination helped spark World War I. Historians view history as a
series of interconnected but highly contingent events—built of myriad and
mostly unseen chains of cause and effect. If Princip’s gun had jammed, the
thinking goes, the archduke would have lived, and Europe’s subsequent
history may well have been very different. Fiction writers have long been
enthralled with these what-ifs (known to philosophers as “counterfactual
histories”): What if Hitler hadn’t flunked out of art school? What if the
Germans had developed the atomic bomb before the Americans? What if
John Lennon had never met Paul McCartney? What if an asteroid hadn’t

Such contingencies presume, of course, that things could have been different
—either because a person exercising their free will could have chosen
another course of action (Princip could have chosen not to pull the trigger)
or because random events (such as the asteroid strike) could have unfolded
differently. But is this attitude compatible with physics? Do the natural laws
of the universe allow for free will?
Scientists and philosophers have been arguing over the question for
centuries and are often torn between two competing poles. Some think, Yes,
you obviously have free will. (Aren’t you already four paragraphs into a
story that you freely chose to read?) Others think, No, you can’t possibly have
free will because the laws of physics say that whatever happens was
determined by what happened immediately before—and the happenings
within human minds are no exception. Recently a new argument for why
quantum mechanics is even more deterministic than physicists might have
thought has sparked the debate anew.

Does Quantum Physics Rule Out Free Will? | Scientific American

The notion that physics and free will might be incompatible goes back at
least to the ancient Greeks, but it was expressed most forcefully by French
scholar and polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace. Perhaps, wondered Laplace,
everything that happens is strictly determined by what came before. His
thought experiment involved an entity, now known as Laplace’s demon, that
can discern the position and momentum of every particle in the universe.
For such a demon, the future is fixed: there can be only one way for the
universe to unfold. The cosmos would be deterministic, meaning that the
future is uniquely determined by the present, which in turn was uniquely
determined by the past. If Laplace was right, the notion of contingency—the
idea that regardless of what’s happening at any moment in time, what
happens next is “up in the air”—would seem to evaporate.
Then at the start of the 20th century came the twin upheavals of quantum
mechanics and relativity. Quantum mechanics, in particular, seemed to have
profound implications for free will and contingency. The theory sees nature
as inherently fuzzy: quantities that were clearly defined in classical physics,
such as position or momentum, are indeterminate in quantum mechanics—
until they’re measured. Upon measuring a system (at least in the so-called
Copenhagen interpretation of the theory), its wave function (a mathematical
description of the system) is said to “collapse,” leaving one unique outcome,
such as a specific observed position or momentum. The theory tells you only
the probability of various outcomes of each observation but not which result
you’ll actually see. At first glance, this haziness might seem to rescue physics
from the clutches of determinism. On the other hand, it’s not clear how
quantum indeterminacy would enable free will because we don’t usually
think of our decision-making processes as random any more than we think
of them as wholly preordained.

But there is another twist in this story—one that crops up when physicists
attempt to apply quantum mechanics to the entire universe (a field known as
quantum cosmology). Some quantum approaches to cosmology, such as the
one envisioned by theoretical physicists Jim Hartle and Stephen Hawking
(and described by Hawking in A Brief History of Time), appear to dictate not
only the rules governing the evolution of the universe but also its initial
state. In this way of seeing things—physicist Roger Penrose called it “strong
determinism” in his book The Emperor’s New Mind—the universe can have
precisely one history. Nothing could have been different from how it
actually was and is. Everything from the trajectory of Princip’s bullet to the
fact that you’re now reading this sentence was prescribed, so to speak, at the
dawn of time.
That’s one way to interpret quantum mechanics—but not the only way.
Another popular take is known as the “many worlds” view (or the Everettian
view, after physicist Hugh Everett III, who first wrote about it in detail). In
this view, everything that can happen does in fact happen—but in a different
universe. So rather than saying that the universe has precisely one history,
proponents of many worlds would say that the “multiverse” has just one
history. Within this multiverse, there are branches, or universes, in which
Princip pulled the trigger and also ones in which he didn’t. There are
universes where Schrödinger’s famous cat is alive and universes where it’s
dead. But the cosmos as a whole is fully determined.

Eddy Keming Chen, a philosopher of physics at the University of California,
San Diego, believes we should take the idea of strong determinism—and its
implications—seriously. If we embrace a theory like the one put forward by
Hartle and Hawking, in which both the dynamics and the initial conditions
of the universe (or multiverse) are specified, then only one unique history is
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-quantum-physics-rule-out-free-will/

4/10

23/03/2025, 22:15

Does Quantum Physics Rule Out Free Will? | Scientific American

possible. From this perspective, quantum mechanics is even more
deterministic than its classical predecessor, Chen argued recently in Nature.
(In a related preprint, Chen developed the idea further, describing what he
calls the “Everettian Wentaculus,” which he wrote is “the first realistic and
simple strongly deterministic theory of the quantum world.”)
But it’s tricky: even if we live in an Everettian multiverse, we only see one
branch—our universe—and within that branch, we still tend to imagine
that multiple outcomes are possible. In his preprint, Chen admits that “it is
an open question how to think about freedom and agency in a multiverse
context.” At the very least, though, the way we usually understand decisions,
choices and contingency would need a rethink, Chen says. He believes that
under strong determinism, it no longer makes sense to speak of
counterfactuals. “You can understand the counterfactuals as referring to
different physical possibilities compatible to the laws of physics,” Chen says.
“But if I tell you there’s only one single possibility, then there are no
counterfactuals. All counterfactuals become meaningless or trivial or
vacuous.” And if there are no counterfactuals, he says, there’s no freedom. As
he wrote in his Nature essay, strong determinism “makes it harder to appeal
to quantum theory to defend free will.”
While physicists continue to debate the idea of strong determinism, Emily
Adlam, a philosopher of physics at Chapman University, agrees with Chen
that it appears to present more of a threat to free will than traditional
determinism, particularly because of its ties to the Everettian multiverse. “In
a standard deterministic picture, sure, everything that happens was
determined from the past—but your mind was a key part of the causal
process by which future events get realized,” Adlam says. “So in some
meaningful sense, future events—even though they were predetermined—
were mediated through processes that you identify with yourself.” But in the
Everettian picture, she says, it’s harder to see where decision-making would

5/10

23/03/2025, 22:15

fit in. “If you always make every possible decision, that does seem to severely
undermine the sense in which you are exercising any meaningful kind of
choice,” she says. “So in that sense, you do seem worse off than in the
standard picture, where one outcome occurs and you play a role in bringing
it about.”
As troubling as quantum mechanics (or at least certain versions of it) may be
for the idea of free will, relativity—the other pillar of modern physics—isn’t
off the hook. Many theorists think of relativity as describing a universe in
which past, present and future are all equally real: a static cosmos that just
sits there like a big block of spacetime (sometimes called the “block
universe”). It’s not that time disappears in this picture—but it no longer
“passes” or “flows.” (As Albert Einstein famously put it, the passage of time is
a “stubbornly persistent illusion.”) Conceptually speaking, the strongly
deterministic quantum universe and the block universe of relativity may not
be so far apart. The quantum version can be thought of as “a kind of
enriched block universe,” says Alastair Wilson, a philosopher of science at
the University of Leeds in England. “Imagine taking a block universe and
adding an extra dimension to it—the dimension of possibility.”
Still, theories about the fundamental nature of space and time need to be
taken with a grain of salt. Physicists have a reasonably good grip on most of
the universe’s 13.8-billion-year history. As we rewind the tape, though, we
find that our understanding of space and time becomes more tenuous as we
get closer to the big bang. In the universe’s first moments, neither relativity
nor quantum mechanics on their own can offer an accurate description of
what’s happening, and there’s no agreed-upon unified theory of quantum
gravity to take their place. In this realm, “notions of space and time
themselves start breaking down at the fundamental level in ways we don’t
understand,” says David Wallace, a physicist and philosopher at the
University of Pittsburgh. “If the notion of time breaks down, then the sharp

distinction between laws, which say how things change over time, and
initial conditions, which say how things are at the initial time, starts
breaking down as well.” Despite how much interest the Hartle-Hawking
proposal has garnered, Wallace cautions that it is still “speculative.” And
although Wallace is an ardent Everettian (as are the well-known scientists
David Deutsch, Max Tegmark and Sean Carroll), the Everettian multiverse
remains controversial as well.
Skepticism about free will is hardly new. Long before quantum mechanics
and relativity came along, people wondered what sort of freedom, if any,
could be found in a universe in which matter merely moves about in
response to forces like balls in a never-ending game of cosmic billiards. The
latest in a long line of free will skeptics is biologist and neurologist Robert
Sapolsky, whose most recent book is entitled Determined: A Science of Life
without Free Will. You are who you are, Sapolsky argues, because of
everything that came before, both in your own life’s history and long before
you were born. After decades of trying to see what wiggle room science
might leave for personal freedoms, he has concluded that “we have no free
will at all,” he wrote in his book.
The preferred “solution” to reconciling possibly deterministic physics and
seemingly free personal choices—the quotation marks are important
because not everyone is onboard—is a position known as compatibilism.
Whatever the fundamental particles and forces might be doing at the
subatomic level, the compatibilist says, human freedom can still exist
because we live our lives in the macroscopic world, where very different
rules apply. Yes, we’re made of atoms (or fluctuating quantum fields, if you
prefer), but it would be absurd to try to describe any feature of human
behavior by analyzing our atoms (or our quantum fields). And although a
slight majority of philosophers identify as compatibilists (polls put the figure

at around 60 percent), others see it as a cop out. Immanuel Kant, for
example, dismissed compatibilism as “wretched subterfuge.” More recently,
neuroscientist Sam Harris wrote in his book Free Will that “from both a
moral and a scientific perspective, [compatibilism] seems deliberately
obtuse.”
For compatibilists, it comes down to a matter of perspective. Wilson gives
the example of astronomer Arthur Eddington, who, writing a century ago,
pointed out that a table loses its tablelike properties when examined at the
microscopic level. “He discovered there’s a lot of empty space between the
particles in the table,” Wilson says. “Does that mean it’s not solid? Or does
that mean that solidity is not what we thought it was?” He suggests looking
at the Everettian multiverse in the same light. From one perspective, we
might say that the very notion of probability has vanished—or we could say
“that there are probabilities—they’re just not what we thought they were.”
For committed compatibilists, the issue of free will doesn’t depend on what
physics says about atoms, forces, quantum fields or anything else that applies
at the microscopic level, and strong determinism is no more upsetting than
regular determinism. As Adlam puts it: “On one level of description, people
are the source of their decisions, and on a different, physical level of
description, the distant past and the laws of physics are the source of their
decisions. And I think if you keep those two levels of description separate, as
you should, then you don’t really have a problem with free will.”

Explainer: does luck exist?

When it comes to being “fortunate”, context is king. kaibara87

Some people seem born lucky. Everything they touch turns to gold. Others are dogged by misfortune.
It’s not just people who might be lucky or unlucky – it can be single acts. When the ball hits a post in
soccer, the commentators often say the striker was unlucky. We sometimes argue whether an act was
lucky or not. I might say your pool shot was lucky. “Not luck; skill”, you might reply.
Is any of this talk sensible? Is there really such a thing as luck? Do some people have more of it than
others (just as some people are better at pool than others)? I think there is a perfectly reasonable way
of making sense of talk about luck. But there is no such thing as luck. It isn’t a property, like mass, or
an object. Rather, to talk about luck is to talk about how things might easily have gone.
This view entails that no-one has luck. We can’t truly say of someone they’re lucky, meaning they are
the kind of person to whom lucky things can be expected to happen.

Explainer: does luck exist?

It has sometimes been suggested that luck exists only if a certain interpretation of quantum
mechanics is true: if causality is not “deterministic”. If physical determinism is true then every event
that occurs is entirely predictable (in principle), by someone who knows enough about the universe
and its laws.

cinnamon_girl

If indeterministic physics is true, then such predictability is not possible: no one, no matter how much
they know, can predict every event that happens, even in principle.
I don’t know which interpretation of quantum mechanics is true, but it seems unlikely to me that we
need to settle that debate to decide whether some things are lucky. It seems obvious to me that the
person who was hit by lightning (on a clear day, if you like) was unlucky, and the person who wins the
lotto is lucky.
Here’s how I understand luck. I think something is lucky (or unlucky) for a person if two things are
true of it: it matters (somehow) to them, and it might easily not have happened. The second condition
needs some explanation.
To say that something might easily not have happened is to say that, given how things were at the
time just before, the event might well not have occurred. We might think of this in terms of replaying
the event. If I set up the pool table again and ask you to retake the shot, we can discover whether your
shot was luck or skill. We will need to do it a few times: you might get lucky twice, but you very
unlikely to be lucky ten times in a row.

24/03/2025, 10:33

Explainer: does luck exist?

If every time you try (roughly) the same shot, you sink it I will have to concede: that’s skill, not luck.
But if you can’t do it again, you were lucky the first time. Similarly, someone was unlucky to be hit by
lightning if it is true that were they to be in similar conditions again, they (probably) would not be hit
by lightning. If, on the other hand, lightning is so prevalent around here that any time anyone goes
out they get hit, then they weren’t unlucky.
If this is right, there can’t be lucky or unlucky people. At least, there can’t be people who have the
property of having lucky events happen to them. Whether I am lucky in doing something depends on
how skillful I am at doing things like that. If I’m really good at it, then I am less lucky at succeeding
than if I am bad at it.
So, roughly, the more often something happens to someone, the less luck is involved. Of course
someone can be lucky or unlucky twice: lightning can strike twice. But the person who is lucky twice,
or more, is not a lucky person: their past luck doesn’t give us any reason to expect luck in their future.

Ch…

Is this good luck, or just physics?

There is one way in which we can say that someone is lucky or unlucky. Rather than compare an event
to what we would expect to happen, given roughly the same circumstances, we might compare a
person’s circumstances or their traits to what is statistically normal for a group. Using this kind of
measure, we can say that someone born severely handicapped is unlucky and someone born into
wealth is lucky.

Explainer: does luck exist?

What is the relevant group for this kind of comparison? I don’t think there is a single right answer
here: it will depend on the context and our aims. For some purposes, a narrower group might be
relevant, and for some, a broader. This entails that the same person might be said to be both lucky
and unlucky.
Think of the contemporary Australian who loses her job, through no fault of her own. We might say
she is unlucky, comparing her to other contemporary Australians. But compared to humanity as a
whole, she might be lucky if she remains able to feed and house herself.
This same kind of context sensitivity and relativism is characteristic of luck in events as well. The
same event can be lucky and unlucky for a person. Think of someone who misses her flight and takes
another one, which then crashes. She is unlucky to be involved in a plane crash, given that she might
easily have been on the earlier flight. But if she is the only survivor, she might be lucky, given that
everyone else died.
That’s why we can find ourselves saying of someone who has broken three ribs and both legs that they
are lucky.

Free will debate rages on, or is it all an illusion?
Readers reflect on the role of chance, randomness and responsibility in
their own lives

Mon 3 May 2021 01.29 AEST

What high-quality letters (29 April) on free will. My A-level psychology students always found this fascinating and usually
thought that free will was obvious until they had examined their own lives and realised that “soft determinism”, well-expounded
by Robert Dimmick, was the likely answer. However, there is a big role for chance.
For example, I probably wouldn’t have been born in 1949 if my father hadn’t dropped a large tin of paint and shattered his foot
while painting the cruiser that he was on during the second world war. His ship sailed without him and was sunk by Japanese
bombers with massive loss of life. My father didn’t choose to drop the paint pot, but thereafter there were broad deterministic
tramlines to his and my life.

On my fifth birthday I lost my mum in a department store, and in a panic left the store to look for her. The memory of the agony
of indecision on whether to go right or left is crystal clear all these years later. I turned left (and was rescued by a policeman). And
now I seem to be choosing to write this letter rather than planting courgettes. That said, there have been many times when it has
felt like my fate was hung around my neck at birth. Does it matter? Just enjoy the mystery. I flip a coin and press “send”.

Free will debate rages on, or is it all an illusion? | Letters | The Guardian

If free will is an illusion, then it’s an illusion whether you believe in it or not. So the Rev Carl Harding’s hard determinists had no
choice but to look both ways before crossing the road. And a hard free will-ist is still going to get hurt when they step out
carelessly. A pity that as they too might well have looked both ways had there been free will.
Paul McLintic
Old Harlow, Essex
The free will arguments are parallel to the nature/nurture debate. The problem is not which side is right (sorry, philosophers),
but which path we should follow. Both the deterministic and nature sides offer their advocates an abnegation of responsibility,
whereas the free will/nurture position is on the side of all of us to take responsibility for our actions, which seems to be what
humanity is all about.
Les Rayner
Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire
With all due respect to your correspondents, quantum fluctuations and an element of randomness are irrelevant to discussions
about whether or not free will exists. The notion of free will, as most people feel that it applies to them, depends on there being a
decision-making entity inside a person’s head, which can somehow operate independently of learning, past experience or
randomness, and which has a separate insight into what that person should or would like to do, and can act upon that insight. Yet
no one has ever explained to me what such an entity is, unless one plumps for the idea that it is one’s immortal soul.
Even that doesn’t totally get one off the hook but, in any case, those of us who believe that there is no supernatural realm and
that the existence of an immortal soul is vanishingly unlikely are left to conclude that all decisions are based on physical laws
combined with some degree of randomness, neither of which point to the existence of free will.
Roger A Fisken
Reading, Berkshire
One thing that I thought was missing in the letters on free will was an adequate treatment of “cause”. The general view was
represented by “The principle that every event has a cause is sound”, as David Woolley wrote. But events have several (or many)
causes. So a “chain of causes” is really a network of causes. This does not of itself undermine the idea of determinism, but does
suggest a weakness in that position. Of course, if we are not responsible agents then most criminal legislation is null and void,
and the Guardian’s headline is totally nugatory.
Ray Hall
Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex
Free will an illusion? That is the least of it. According to the mathematical monism proposed by Max Tegmark, the entire
material cosmos is illusory. The problem arises from the belief that everything has to be physics, or chaos has come again.
Physics is bound to end in abstractions, it is not equipped to do anything else. Physics is about facts (Earth orbits the sun), and
generalities (laws of science). Reality is about things like the pain in my foot, which is not your pain, doesn’t involve your foot
and in any case disappears when I sit down. Free will is not a concept, it is an experience. People like Daniel Dennett, for whom
everything must be physics, are the mirror image of new agers, who say all is spirit. Both beliefs are rooted in dogma.

sophisticated brains. This gives them a range of behavioural
options – a degree of freedom, we might say.

It is often thought that science has shown that there is no
such thing as free will. If all things are bound by the same
impersonal cosmic laws, then (the story goes) our paths are
no freer than those of rocks tumbling down a hill. But this is
wrong. Science is giving us a very powerful and clear way to
understand freedom of the will. We have just been looking for
it in the wrong place. Instead of using an electron microscope
or a brain-scanner, we should go to the zoo.

There we will find animals using a wide range of skills that
give them options for what to do – skills that we share. These
abilities have evolved through natural selection because they
are essential for survival: animals need to weigh different
factors, explore available options, pursue new alternatives
when old strategies don’t work. Together these abilities give
all animals, including humans, an entirely natural free will,
one that we need precisely because we are not rocks. We are
complex organisms actively pursuing our interests in a
changing environment.

And we are starting to understand the cognitive abilities that
underpin this behavioural freedom. Like most evolved
capacities, they are a matter of degree. Take, for example, the
ability to delay gratification. For a hungry cat, this means
being able to hold back from pouncing until it is sure the
sparrow is within range and looking the other way.
Experimenters measure this ability by testing how long an
animal can resist a small treat in return for a larger reward
after a delay. Chickens, for example, can do this for six
seconds. They can choose whether to wait for the juicier titbit
or not – but only if that titbit comes very soon. A chimpanzee,
on the other hand, can wait for a cool two minutes – or even

Free will is back, and maybe this time we can measure it | Aeon Essays

The chimpanzee therefore has more options: if a juicier treat
became available after six seconds, a chimp would be free to
choose whether to wait for it, but a chicken would not. If you
can delay gratification even longer, you have still more
options: whether to turn down dessert because you are on a
diet, or to forego all pleasure in this world in the hope of a
heavenly reward.

As we start to understand, and learn to measure, the
capacities that underlie behavioural freedom, we can begin to
put this natural free will on a scale. Paralleling the
measurement of intelligence, we could call it the freedom
quotient: FQ. Such a scale should give us new insights into the
factors that hinder or enhance our efforts to shape our lives. In
other words, FQ should tell us how free we are – and how we
can become even more so.

W e desperately need a new way of thinking about free will.
The concept lies at the heart of how we see ourselves:
assumptions about the extent to which we choose our own
fate inform everything from social policy and criminal justice
to our personal motivations and sense of life’s
meaningfulness. But common conceptions are a muddle,
mostly stemming from a pre-scientific age.

One prevalent idea is that freedom requires a supernatural
ability to transcend the laws of nature, because otherwise we
would appear to be mere puppets of cause and effect. This
makes free will into something mysterious, which would set us
apart from the rest of creation. As this notion contradicts
everything we know about the world, it is no surprise that ever
more people are concluding that free will must be an illusion.

Yet all around us, every day, we see a very natural kind of
freedom – one that is completely compatible with
determinism. It is the kind that living things need to pursue
their goals in a world that continually presents them with

3/11

23/03/2025, 22:16

Free will is back, and maybe this time we can measure it | Aeon Essays

multiple possibilities. Our intuitive sense that we have free will
is based upon this behavioural freedom. And unlike the old
mystical idea, this natural ability to shape our future is central
to our own wellbeing and that of society. This is what FQ sets
out to capture.

A few thinkers have been working towards a naturalistic
approach to free will since the 1970s. But in recent years their
number has mushroomed – to the point where we might now
talk about a small but significant revolution in ideas. There is
not yet one single dominant view or definition: different
scholars from different traditions tend to emphasise different
aspects. But when we join the available dots we get a fairly
clear sketch of what FQ might aspire to measure. And it is
simply this: the ability to generate options for oneself, to
choose, and then to pursue one or more of those options.

Each of these parts is important. First: the capacity to
generate options. We are not inclined to ascribe much free will
to the creature that sees only one possible course of action,
particularly in situations where that course is failing to deliver
the goods. That is the kind of behaviour we might associate
with an automaton – with the robot whose axles keep turning
even though the wheels have fallen off. In 1982 the American
cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter called such behaviour
‘sphexish’ after the digger wasp Sphex ichneumoneus that
allegedly follows very inflexible behavioural routines (and is
therefore easily tricked by mean entomologists). It is disputed
whether the wasps really are so unbending, but the name has
stuck to denote a mechanistic pursuit of a single course of
action.

Of course, the number of available options will depend partly
upon the circumstances – but also partly on a creature’s
creativity and flexibility. In one test to get a treat out of a
complex box, for example, chimps tried up to 38 different
ways of solving the problem, whereas baboons managed just a
handful.

So we want the ability to generate multiple options. But
secondly, we also want to be able to choose between them in a
meaningful way. Choosing meaningfully means something
like weighing up the pros and cons. If a creature were able to
generate six options for itself in any given situation, we might
be impressed. But we would be less impressed if it arbitrarily
chose which option to take. We would probably conclude that
this creature was driven more by randomness than by a
genuinely free will. Of course there will be times when we
might just as well toss a coin, either because the options are
identical (to go foraging in either of two equally laden
blackberry bushes) or because we do not have the
information to make an informed choice (to explore either of
two equally unknown paths in the forest). But most of the
time, we want to weigh the options and choose between them
in the light of our interests and values (the blackberry bush
farthest from the bear’s den).

Thirdly, we want to carry out the choices we have made.
Admittedly, much of this depends on things that go on
outside of our heads: my decision to eat blackberries could
easily be thwarted by finding that they are rotten. But a lot of
what is required to see our decisions through also
corresponds to processes inside our heads, processes that we
traditionally associate with the will. Being free to write an
essay, for example, requires that I have the concentration and
self-control to stop myself from surfing the web instead.

This three-phased approach is a simplified sketch: the messy
reality is that these phases overlap and interact with each
other (and with a lot else besides). But it does provide a loose
framework within which to consider the kind of underlying
capacities that we need in order to exercise natural free will.
The first phase, in which we generate options for ourselves, is
associated with creativity and innovativeness; perhaps also a
kind of openness or intellectual adventurousness. By contrast,
the second phase, the ability to weigh options, is what we
ordinarily consider to be the capacity to reason. The third
phase, pursuing the chosen option, requires different
https://aeon.co/essays/free-will-is-back-and-maybe-this-time-we-can-measure-it

5/11

23/03/2025, 22:16

Free will is back, and maybe this time we can measure it | Aeon Essays

capacities again – mostly what goes under the heading of
willpower, such as the ability to delay gratification, which for
chickens means up to a six‑second limit and for great apes,
including humans, somewhat longer.

I f you are able to imagine a number of options for yourself,
weigh them with regard to your interests, and then commit
yourself to the one that seems the best, you are exercising
your free will. Of course, all of these are tasks you might be
able to perform better or worse. If you have an abundant
imagination, for example, and can think of 20 potential places
to forage whereas others can only think of 10, then you have
more options and will therefore be freer. If, on the other hand,
you are weak-willed, then options that require you to delay
gratification – such as walking 10 miles to the juiciest
blackberry bush – might be closed, and so you will be less
free. These are the variations that an FQ scale should reflect.

At present, we are some way from being able to measure FQ
in a generalised sense. Some of the capacities central to this
idea of natural free will have established tests, like the
American psychologist Walter Mischel’s 1970s ‘marshmallow
test’ for self-control (one marshmallow is placed in front of
you; if you manage to not eat it for 15 minutes, you get a
second one – and are allowed to eat both). But the
measurement of, say, creativity remains controversial,
although tests do exist (eg, how many uses can you think of
for a jellybean?). And once all the component capacities do
have reliable tests, there would then come the tricky problem
of how to weight them in order to come to an overall score. Is
someone who considers few options but is very good at seeing
their decision through freer than someone who conjures a
host of creative options but is poor at implementing them?

Fortunately, compilers of psychometric tests are used to
making such tricky decisions. And it might be that different
weightings prove useful for different purposes. In this sense,
FQ would be no different from IQ, the intelligence quotient.

Like free will, intelligence is a useful but rather fuzzy-edged
idea that on closer inspection has many components. IQ tests
reflect this: they are composed of sub-tests that measure such
different abilities as verbal comprehension, spatial reasoning
and working memory. FQ, too, would be a broad summary of
a range of component abilities reflecting the different phases
of decision-making.

And as with IQ, the usefulness of an FQ scale will depend on
whether it correlates with anything else of interest. We would
expect someone with, for example, a high IQ to be better at
solving difficult engineering problems, learning new
languages or constructing complex arguments in law courts.
If high IQ did not correlate with these things, we would
wonder if it was a meaningful reflection of what we ordinarily
consider to be intelligence. Similarly with FQ: we would
expect those scoring highly to be good decision-makers, with
a strong sense of ownership of their actions and control over
their fate; whereas those scoring lowly would be those who
see few options for themselves, who feel compelled or
addicted, and who are unable to meet their goals or stick to
their plans.

Once up and running, we can imagine the kinds of
applications and consequences that FQ, as a measure of
natural free will, might have. First, we usually hold people
accountable for acts that they made freely: if a person lashed
out while having an epileptic fit, we would not blame them as
we would if they punched someone after cool reflection. But
there is no agreed basis for assessing which acts are free.
Different countries –­and even different states within
countries – approach this differently, using a muddle of
factors from psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience without
a coherent framework. At the same time, many are dissuaded
from thinking too deeply about underlying causes, because in
the old paradigm this implies a determinism that undermines
all accountability.

Free will is back, and maybe this time we can measure it | Aeon Essays

A measure such as FQ could help to bring some clarity to
these discussions – though the implications for deciding who
should be punished, when and why, are complex. But it is a
fair prediction that most current prison inmates have a lower
FQ than average (in one New Zealand study, for example, 40
per cent of those with the lowest level of self-control had
criminal convictions by the age of 32) – and so in that sense
could be considered less accountable. And whether or not
prisons are an effective deterrent, it is a reasonable prediction
that they are further lowering the inmates’ FQ: making
responsible decisions depends on a set of skills, but prisons
are (mostly) highly regulated, low-stimulation environments,
with few opportunities to develop any such skills. No wonder
that reoffending rates are high.

Second, FQ could help us to better understand the complex
relationship between free will and social and political
freedom. It is clear that states can restrict the freedom of their
citizens through laws and other measures. But a state could
also limit freedom by hindering the development of FQ, for
example, by restricting access to education or brainwashing
with propaganda. The long and shameful history of bookbanning reflects attempts to diminish a people’s freedom not
through chains or walls, but through limiting the options and
ideas that occur to them.

But a person’s FQ will be affected by his environment even
without such explicit manipulation. Someone’s sense of
whether a wide range of options are available to her will
depend upon the attitudes of her parents, teachers and the
messages she receives from broader society. Girls in the US,
for example, tend to have a lower sense of their competence in
maths and sciences than boys, regardless of their actual
grades – and consequently fewer girls see careers in these
areas as an option. African Americans have a lower sense that
their fate is in their own hands than do white Americans – a
sense (called locus of control) that is associated with higher
academic attainment.

It will always be the case that some people have a freer will
than others, and some of that will come down to genes and
fortune. But much of that inequality will also stem from
systemic advantages and disadvantages: say, the difference
between a privileged upbringing with the best education and
a community that says everything is possible versus an
upbringing that stunts a person’s innate capacities and tells
him he is a loser. Some people are lucky, developing the will
and opportunities to succeed despite a tough start. But for
others, a low FQ will make it difficult for them to improve their
lot.

Attempting to smooth out inequalities in FQ – and to raise the
FQ of everyone – should therefore be a goal of schools and of
social policy. This ties in with the idea of ‘positive liberty’ —
the idea that a person should be free, not just from restraints,
but through having the skills and opportunities to actively
pursue a fulfilling life. Of course, all this assumes that a higher
FQ is a thoroughly good thing. But we have good reason to
think that this is indeed so, both from society’s point of view,
and for each of us individually.

Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University and
a leading advocate of a naturalised approach to free will, has
argued that our capacities for reason, self-control and so forth
evolved to enable us to live in complex societies. The notion
that we need a significant part of our free will in order to
follow rules might at first sound counter-intuitive. But it is
actually a familiar idea: we know, for example, that a strong
will is required to resist temptation. Often those temptations
are to do things that violate social norms, such as coveting
your neighbour’s ass or punching him if he covets yours.
Hence it is a good guess that prison populations will have
lower than average FQs and – equally – that raising FQs
would reduce crime.

As well as being broadly socially desirable in the sense that it
helps us to manage our behaviour so that we can all get along,
https://aeon.co/essays/free-will-is-back-and-maybe-this-time-we-can-measure-it

9/11

23/03/2025, 22:16

Free will is back, and maybe this time we can measure it | Aeon Essays

a higher FQ should also bring personal benefits. Certainly
some of its component elements do correlate with good
things. The personality trait known as openness to
experience, which includes curiosity and imagination and is
therefore crucial to the option-generating phase, has been
associated with higher job satisfaction, happiness and quality
of life. Or self-control, which is essential to putting one’s
choice into effect, correlates with higher educational
attainment, more stable relationships and lower frequencies
of drug use or criminal conviction.

Once we understand the particular set of capacities that
contribute to a free will, we can each individually think about
how we might become freer. We can expand our possibilities
by learning to be more creative and to explore more options;
we can learn techniques that help us to better choose between
those options; and we can strengthen the capacities, such as
focus and willpower, that allow us to pursue our choices. This
might not guarantee happiness and self-fulfillment, but it
should make them more likely. Certainly it would put us more
in control of our lives: that is, better able to align our everyday
actions with our deepest goals and values.

I have claimed that FQ – the freedom quotient – is a measure
of our natural freedom of the will. But some people will ask
whether these psychological capacities are really free will: for
some, a really free will is one that is not determined by
anything – one that stands outside the causal chains of
nature. Such a person might feel cheated when offered
instead a set of capacities that we share (to a degree) with cats
and chickens.

We could of course use a different name for what FQ is
describing: perhaps ‘psychological freedom’, ‘inner freedom’,
‘autonomy’ or ‘agency’. But I think there are good reasons to
stick with the old term. Although there is one strand of
thinking in which free will is juxtaposed with determinism,
there are also other, more everyday uses that are much less

10/11

23/03/2025, 22:16

metaphysical. One recent study, for example, found that ‘the
folk concept of free will is defined by the capacity to choose
based on one’s desires and free from constraints’. Another
found that ‘conscious, rational choice and self-control seem to
be integral parts of what people perceive as free’.

Even when theologians use the term ‘free will’, they are still
referring to something very close to what FQ describes. It is
with our will, they might say, that we choose to give into
temptation or instead to take the path of righteousness. I
agree. The difference is that in the Christian tradition, our
wills must be absolutely free – not caused by anything such as
genes or environment – as only then could it possibly be
warranted to send sinners to hell for eternity. With FQ, by
contrast, we can recognise that even the freest will is still
limited, and that everyone is ultimately a part of life’s great
web of causes and connections.

Here again the comparison with intelligence is revealing. For
much of the past 2,000 years in the West, intelligence was
conceived in terms of a God-given faculty of reason that set
humans wholly apart from other creatures. ‘Intellect’ and ‘will’
were seen by the medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas, for
example, as the two pre‑eminent faculties of the soul, which
did not depend at all on the body.

Now we know differently: we know that we have evolved
through a long process of natural selection and that we share
our faculties to varying degrees with other animals. Upon
realising this, we did not conclude that there wasn’t really any
such thing as intelligence – rather, psychologists set about
putting it on a scientific footing. Similarly, we should not say
that there is no such thing as free will, just because it is not
how the theologians imagined; rather, it is time we put it, too,
on a scientific footing.

model that you like and are in complete control of your decision. When you
finally click the “add to shopping cart” button, you believe that you are doing
so out of your own free will.
But what if we told you that while you thought that you were still browsing,
your brain activity had already highlighted the headphones you would pick?
That idea may not be so far-fetched. Though neuroscientists likely could not
predict your choice with 100 percent accuracy, research has demonstrated
that some information about your upcoming action is present in brain
activity several seconds before you even become conscious of your decision.
As early as the 1960s, studies found that when people perform a simple,
spontaneous movement, their brain exhibits a buildup in neural activity—
what neuroscientists call a “readiness potential”—before they move. In the
1980s, neuroscientist Benjamin Libet reported this readiness potential even
preceded a person’s reported intention to move, not just their movement. In
2008 a group of researchers found that some information about an
upcoming decision is present in the brain up to 10 seconds in advance, long
before people reported making the decision of when or how to act.
These studies have sparked questions and debates. To many observers, these
findings debunked the intuitive concept of free will. After all, if
neuroscientists can infer the timing or choice of your movements long
before you are consciously aware of your decision, perhaps people are
merely puppets, pushed around by neural processes unfolding below the
threshold of consciousness.
But as researchers who study volition from both a neuroscientific and
philosophical perspective, we believe that there’s still much more to this
story. We work with a collaboration of philosophers and scientists to
provide more nuanced interpretations—including a better understanding of
the readiness potential—and a more fruitful theoretical framework in which

to place them. The conclusions suggest “free will” remains a useful concept,
although people may need to reexamine how they define it.
Let’s start from a commonsense observation: much of what people do each
day is arbitrary. We put one foot in front of the other when we start
walking. Most of the time, we do not actively deliberate about which leg to
put forward first. It doesn’t matter. The same is true for many other actions
and choices. They are largely meaningless and irreflective.
Most empirical studies of free will—including Libet’s—have focused on
these kinds of arbitrary actions. In such actions, researchers can indeed “read
out” our brain activity and trace information about our movements and
choices before we even realize we are about to make them. But if these
actions don’t matter to us, is it all that notable that they are initiated
unconsciously? More significant decisions—such as whether to take a job,
get married or move to a different country—are infinitely more interesting
and complex and are quite consciously made.
If we start working with a more philosophically grounded understanding of
free will, we realize that only a small subset of our everyday actions is
important enough to worry about. We want to feel in control of those
decisions, the ones whose outcomes make a difference in our life and whose
responsibility we feel on our shoulders. It is in this context—decisions that
matter—that the question of free will most naturally applies.
In 2019 neuroscientists Uri Maoz, Liad Mudrik and their colleagues
investigated that idea. They presented participants with a choice of two
nonprofit organizations to which they could donate $1,000. People could
indicate their preferred organization by pressing the left or right button. In
some cases, participants knew that their choice mattered because the button
would determine which organization would receive the full $1,000. In other
cases, people knowingly made meaningless choices because they were told
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/free-will-is-only-an-illusion-if-you-are-too/

3/7

23/03/2025, 22:14

Free Will Is Only an Illusion if You Are, Too | Scientific American

that both organizations would receive $500 regardless of their selection.
The results were somewhat surprising. Meaningless choices were preceded
by a readiness potential, just as in previous experiments. Meaningful choices
were not, however. When we care about a decision and its outcome, our
brain appears to behave differently than when a decision is arbitrary.
Even more interesting is the fact that ordinary people’s intuitions about free
will and decision-making do not seem consistent with these findings. Some
of our colleagues, including Maoz and neuroscientist Jake Gavenas, recently
published the results of a large survey, with more than 600 respondents, in
which they asked people to rate how “free” various choices made by others
seemed. Their ratings suggested that people do not recognize that the brain
may handle meaningful choices in a different way from more arbitrary or
meaningless ones. People tend, in other words, to imagine all their choices
—from which sock to put on first to where to spend a vacation—as equally
“free,” even though neuroscience suggests otherwise.
What this tells us is that free will may exist, but it may not operate in the
way we intuitively imagine. In the same vein, there is a second intuition that
must be addressed to understand studies of volition. When experiments
have found that brain activity, such as the readiness potential, precedes the
conscious intention to act, some people have jumped to the conclusion that
they are “not in charge.” They do not have free will, they reason, because
they are somehow subject to their brain activity.
But that assumption misses a broader lesson from neuroscience. “We” are
our brain. The combined research makes clear that human beings do have
the power to make conscious choices. But that agency and accompanying
sense of personal responsibility are not supernatural. They happen in the
brain, regardless of whether scientists observe them as clearly as they do a
readiness potential.

So there is no “ghost” inside the cerebral machine. But as researchers, we
argue that this machinery is so complex, inscrutable and mysterious that
popular concepts of “free will” or the “self” remain incredibly useful. They
help us think through and imagine—albeit imperfectly—the workings of the
mind and brain. As such, they can guide and inspire our investigations in
profound ways—provided we continue to question and test these
assumptions along the way.

Free Will versus the Programmed Brain

If our actions are determined by prior events, then do we have a choice about
anything—or any responsibility for what we do?

BY SHAUN NICHOLS
Mind & Brain

Many scientists and philosophers are convinced that free will doesn’t exist at
all. According to these skeptics, everything that happens is determined by
what happened before—our actions are inevitable consequences of the
events leading up to the action—and this fact makes it impossible for
anyone to do anything that is truly free. This kind of anti-free will stance
stretches back to 18th century philosophy, but the idea has recently been
getting much more exposure through popular science books and magazine
articles. Should we worry? If people come to believe that they don’t have free
will, what will the consequences be for moral responsibility?
In a clever new study, psychologists Kathleen Vohs at the University of
Minnesota and Jonathan Schooler at the University of California at Santa
Barbara tested this question by giving participants passages from The
Astonishing Hypothesis, a popular science book by Francis Crick, a biochemist
and Nobel laureate (as co-discoverer, with James Watson, of the DNA
double helix). Half of the participants got a passage saying that there is no
such thing as free will. The passage begins as follows: “‘You,’ your joys and
your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal
identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast
assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. Who you are is

nothing but a pack of neurons.”
The passage then goes on to talk about the neural basis of decisions and
claims that “…although we appear to have free will, in fact, our choices have
already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that.” The other
participants got a passage that was similarly scientific-sounding, but it was
about the importance of studying consciousness, with no mention of free
will.
After reading the passages, all participants completed a survey on their belief
in free will. Then comes the inspired part of the experiment. Participants
were told to complete 20 arithmetic problems that would appear on the
computer screen. But they were also told that when the question appeared,
they needed to press the space bar, otherwise a computer glitch would make
the answer appear on the screen, too. The participants were told that no one
would know whether they pushed the space bar, but they were asked not to
cheat.
The results were clear: those who read the anti-free will text cheated more
often! (That is, they pressed the space bar less often than the other
participants.) Moreover, the researchers found that the amount a participant
cheated correlated with the extent to which they rejected free will in their
survey responses.
Varieties of Immorality
Philosophers have raised questions about some elements of the study. For
one thing, the anti-free will text presents a bleak worldview, and that alone
might lead one to cheat more in such a context (“OMG, if I’m just a pack of
neurons, I have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/free-will-vs-programmed-brain/

experiment!”). It might be that one would also find increased cheating if you
gave people a passage arguing that all sentient life will ultimately be
destroyed in the heat death of the universe.
On the other hand, the results fit with what some philosophers had
predicted. The Western conception idea of free will seems bound up with
our sense of moral responsibility, guilt for misdeeds and pride in
accomplishment. We hold ourselves responsible precisely when we think
that our actions come from free will. In this light, it’s not surprising that
people behave less morally as they become skeptical of free will. Further, the
Vohs and Schooler result fits with the idea that people will behave less
responsibly if they regard their actions as beyond their control. If I think
that there’s no point in trying to be good, then I’m less likely to try.
Even if giving up on free will does have these deleterious effects, one might
wonder how far they go. One question is whether the effects extend across
the moral domain. Cheating in a psychology experiment doesn’t seem too
terrible. Presumably the experiment didn’t also lead to a rash of criminal
activity among those who read the anti-free will passage. Our moral
revulsion at killing and hurting others is likely too strong to be dismantled
by reflections about determinism. It might well turn out that other kinds of
immoral behavior, like cheating in school, would be affected by the rejection
of free will, however.
Is the Effect Permanent?
Another question is how long-lived the effect is. The Vohs and Schooler
study suggests that immediately after people are made skeptical of free will,
they cheat more. But what would happen if those people were brought back

to the lab two weeks later? We might find that they would continue to be
skeptical of free will but they would no longer cheat more.
There is no direct evidence on this question, but there is recent evidence on
a related issue. Philosopher Hagop Sarkissian of the City Univeristy of New
York and colleagues had people from Hong Kong, India, Colombia and the
U.S. complete a survey on determinism and moral responsibility.
Determinism was described in nontechnical terms, and participants were
asked (in effect): whether our universe was a deterministic universe and
whether people in a deterministic universe are morally responsible for their
actions.
Across cultures, they found that most people said that our universe is not
deterministic and also that people in the deterministic universe are not
responsible for their actions. Although that isn’t particularly surprising—
people want to believe they have free will—something pretty interesting
emerges when you look at the smaller group of people who say that our
universe is deterministic. Across all of the cultures, this substantial minority
of free will skeptics were also much more likely to say that people are
responsible even if determinism is true. One way to interpret this finding is
that if you come to believe in determinism, you won’t drop your moral
attitudes. Rather, you’ll simply reverse your view that determinism rules out
moral responsibility.
Many philosophers and scientists reject free will and, while there has been
no systematic study of the matter, there’s currently little reason to think that
the philosophers and scientists who reject free will are generally less morally
upright than those who believe in it. But this raises yet another puzzling
question about the belief in free will. People who explicitly deny free will
often continue to hold themselves responsible for their actions and feel
guilty for doing wrong. Have such people managed to accommodate the rest

of their attitudes to their rejection of free will? Have they adjusted their
notion of guilt and responsibility so that it really doesn’t depend on the
existence of free will? Or is it that when they are in the thick of things,
trying to decide what to do, trying to do the right thing, they just fall back
into the belief that they do have free will after all?

Free Will: Now You Have It, Now You Don’t
By Dennis Overbye
Jan. 2, 2007

I was a free man until they brought the dessert menu around. There was one of those
molten chocolate cakes, and I was suddenly being dragged into a vortex, swirling
helplessly toward caloric doom, sucked toward the edge of a black (chocolate) hole.
Visions of my father’s heart attack danced before my glazed eyes. My wife, Nancy, had a
resigned look on her face.
The outcome, endlessly replayed whenever we go out, is never in doubt, though I often
cover my tracks by offering to split my dessert with the table. O.K., I can imagine what
you’re thinking. There but for the grace of God.
Having just lived through another New Year’s Eve, many of you have just resolved to be
better, wiser, stronger and richer in the coming months and years. After all, we’re free
humans, not slaves, robots or animals doomed to repeat the same boring mistakes over
and over again. As William James wrote in 1890, the whole “sting and excitement” of life
comes from “our sense that in it things are really being decided from one moment to
another, and that it is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable ages
ago.” Get over it, Dr. James. Go get yourself fitted for a new chain-mail vest. A bevy of
experiments in recent years suggest that the conscious mind is like a monkey riding a
tiger of subconscious decisions and actions in progress, frantically making up stories
about being in control.
As a result, physicists, neuroscientists and computer scientists have joined the heirs of
Plato and Aristotle in arguing about what free will is, whether we have it, and if not, why
we ever thought we did in the first place.
“Is it an illusion? That’s the question,” said Michael Silberstein, a science philosopher at
Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. Another question, he added, is whether talking
about this in public will fan the culture wars.
“If people freak at evolution, etc.,” he wrote in an e-mail message, “how much more will
they freak if scientists and philosophers tell them they are nothing more than
sophisticated meat machines, and is that conclusion now clearly warranted or is it
premature?”
Daniel C. Dennett, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at Tufts University who has
written extensively about free will, said that “when we consider whether free will is an
illusion or reality, we are looking into an abyss. What seems to confront us is a plunge into

nihilism and despair.”
Mark Hallett, a researcher with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke, said, “Free will does exist, but it’s a perception, not a power or a driving force.
People experience free will. They have the sense they are free.
“The more you scrutinize it, the more you realize you don’t have it,” he said.
That is hardly a new thought. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said, as
Einstein paraphrased it, that “a human can very well do what he wants, but cannot will
what he wants.”
Einstein, among others, found that a comforting idea. “This knowledge of the nonfreedom of the will protects me from losing my good humor and taking much too
seriously myself and my fellow humans as acting and judging individuals,” he said.
How comforted or depressed this makes you might depend on what you mean by free
will. The traditional definition is called “libertarian” or “deep” free will. It holds that
humans are free moral agents whose actions are not predetermined. This school of
thought says in effect that the whole chain of cause and effect in the history of the
universe stops dead in its tracks as you ponder the dessert menu.
At that point, anything is possible. Whatever choice you make is unforced and could have
been otherwise, but it is not random. You are responsible for any damage to your
pocketbook and your arteries.
“That strikes many people as incoherent,” said Dr. Silberstein, who noted that every
physical system that has been investigated has turned out to be either deterministic or
random. “Both are bad news for free will,” he said. So if human actions can’t be caused
and aren’t random, he said, “It must be — what — some weird magical power?”

Jonathan Rosen

People who believe already that humans are magic will have no problem with that.
But whatever that power is — call it soul or the spirit — those people have to explain how
it could stand independent of the physical universe and yet reach from the immaterial
world and meddle in our own, jiggling brain cells that lead us to say the words “molten

chocolate.”
A vote in favor of free will comes from some physicists, who say it is a prerequisite for
inventing theories and planning experiments.
That is especially true when it comes to quantum mechanics, the strange paradoxical
theory that ascribes a microscopic randomness to the foundation of reality. Anton
Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, said recently that quantum
randomness was “not a proof, just a hint, telling us we have free will.”
Is there any evidence beyond our own intuitions and introspections that humans work
that way?
Two Tips of the Iceberg
In the 1970s, Benjamin Libet, a physiologist at the University of California, San Francisco,
wired up the brains of volunteers to an electroencephalogram and told the volunteers to
make random motions, like pressing a button or flicking a finger, while he noted the time
on a clock.
Dr. Libet found that brain signals associated with these actions occurred half a second
before the subject was conscious of deciding to make them.
The order of brain activities seemed to be perception of motion, and then decision, rather
than the other way around.
In short, the conscious brain was only playing catch-up to what the unconscious brain
was already doing. The decision to act was an illusion, the monkey making up a story
about what the tiger had already done.
Dr. Libet’s results have been reproduced again and again over the years, along with other
experiments that suggest that people can be easily fooled when it comes to assuming
ownership of their actions. Patients with tics or certain diseases, like chorea, cannot say
whether their movements are voluntary or involuntary, Dr. Hallett said.
In some experiments, subjects have been tricked into believing they are responding to
stimuli they couldn’t have seen in time to respond to, or into taking credit or blame for
things they couldn’t have done. Take, for example, the “voodoo experiment” by Dan
Wegner, a psychologist at Harvard, and Emily Pronin of Princeton. In the experiment,
two people are invited to play witch doctor.
One person, the subject, puts a curse on the other by sticking pins into a doll. The second
person, however, is in on the experiment, and by prior arrangement with the doctors, acts
either obnoxious, so that the pin-sticker dislikes him, or nice.

After a while, the ostensible victim complains of a headache. In cases in which he or she
was unlikable, the subject tended to claim responsibility for causing the headache, an
example of the “magical thinking” that makes baseball fans put on their rally caps.
“We made it happen in a lab,” Dr. Wegner said.
Is a similar sort of magical thinking responsible for the experience of free will?
“We see two tips of the iceberg, the thought and the action,” Dr. Wegner said, “and we
draw a connection.”

Jonathan Rosen

But most of the action is going on beneath the surface. Indeed, the conscious mind is
often a drag on many activities. Too much thinking can give a golfer the yips. Drivers
perform better on automatic pilot. Fiction writers report writing in a kind of trance in
which they simply take dictation from the voices and characters in their head, a grace
that is, alas, rarely if ever granted nonfiction writers.
Naturally, almost everyone has a slant on such experiments and whether or not the word
“illusion” should be used in describing free will. Dr. Libet said his results left room for a
limited version of free will in the form of a veto power over what we sense ourselves
doing. In effect, the unconscious brain proposes and the mind disposes.
In a 1999 essay, he wrote that although this might not seem like much, it was enough to
satisfy ethical standards. “Most of the Ten Commandments are ‘do not’ orders,” he wrote.
But that might seem a pinched and diminished form of free will.
Good Intentions
Dr. Dennett, the Tufts professor, is one of many who have tried to redefine free will in a
way that involves no escape from the materialist world while still offering enough
autonomy for moral responsibility, which seems to be what everyone cares about.

The belief that the traditional intuitive notion of a free will divorced from causality is
inflated, metaphysical nonsense, Dr. Dennett says reflecting an outdated dualistic view of
the world.
Rather, Dr. Dennett argues, it is precisely our immersion in causality and the material
world that frees us. Evolution, history and culture, he explains, have endowed us with
feedback systems that give us the unique ability to reflect and think things over and to
imagine the future. Free will and determinism can co-exist.
“All the varieties of free will worth having, we have,” Dr. Dennett said.
“We have the power to veto our urges and then to veto our vetoes,” he said. “We have the
power of imagination, to see and imagine futures.”
In this regard, causality is not our enemy but our friend, giving us the ability to look
ahead and plan. “That’s what makes us moral agents,” Dr. Dennett said. “You don’t need a
miracle to have responsibility.”
Other philosophers disagree on the degree and nature of such “freedom.” Their
arguments partly turn on the extent to which collections of things, whether electrons or
people, can transcend their origins and produce novel phenomena.
These so-called emergent phenomena, like brains and stock markets, or the idea of
democracy, grow naturally in accordance with the laws of physics, so the story goes. But
once they are here, they play by new rules, and can even act on their constituents, as
when an artist envisions a teapot and then sculpts it — a concept sometimes known as
“downward causation.” A knowledge of quarks is no help in predicting hurricanes — it’s
physics all the way down. But does the same apply to the stock market or to the brain?
Are the rules elusive just because we can’t solve the equations or because something
fundamentally new happens when we increase numbers and levels of complexity?
Opinions vary about whether it will ultimately prove to be physics all the way down, total
independence from physics, or some shade in between, and thus how free we are. Dr.
Silberstein, the Elizabethtown College professor, said, “There’s nothing in fundamental
physics by itself that tells us we can’t have such emergent properties when we get to
different levels of complexities.”
He waxed poetically as he imagined how the universe would evolve, with more and more
complicated forms emerging from primordial quantum muck as from an elaborate
computer game, in accordance with a few simple rules: “If you understand, you ought to
be awestruck, you ought to be bowled over.”
George R. F. Ellis, a cosmologist at the University of Cape Town, said that freedom could
emerge from this framework as well. “A nuclear bomb, for example, proceeds to detonate
according to the laws of nuclear physics,” he explained in an e-mail message. “Whether it

does indeed detonate is determined by political and ethical considerations, which are of a
completely different order.”
I have to admit that I find these kind of ideas inspiring, if not liberating. But I worry that I
am being sold a sort of psychic perpetual motion machine. Free wills, ideas, phenomena
created by physics but not accountable to it. Do they offer a release from the chains of
determinism or just a prescription for a very intricate weave of the links?And so I sought
clarity from mathematicians and computer scientists. According to deep mathematical
principles, they say, even machines can become too complicated to predict their own
behavior and would labor under the delusion of free will.

Jonathan Rosen

If by free will we mean the ability to choose, even a simple laptop computer has some
kind of free will, said Seth Lloyd, an expert on quantum computing and professor of
mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Every time you click on an icon, he explained, the computer’s operating system decides
how to allocate memory space, based on some deterministic instructions. But, Dr. Lloyd
said, “If I ask how long will it take to boot up five minutes from now, the operating system
will say ‘I don’t know, wait and see, and I’ll make decisions and let you know.’ ”
Why can’t computers say what they’re going to do? In 1930, the Austrian philosopher
Kurt Gödel proved that in any formal system of logic, which includes mathematics and a
kind of idealized computer called a Turing machine, there are statements that cannot be

proven either true or false. Among them are self-referential statements like the famous
paradox stated by the Cretan philosopher Epimenides, who said that all Cretans are liars:
if he is telling the truth, then, as a Cretan, he is lying.
One implication is that no system can contain a complete representation of itself, or as
Janna Levin, a cosmologist at Barnard College of Columbia University and author of the
2006 novel about Gödel, “A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines,” said: “Gödel says you
can’t program intelligence as complex as yourself. But you can let it evolve. A complex
machine would still suffer from the illusion of free will.”
Another implication is there is no algorithm, or recipe for computation, to determine
when or if any given computer program will finish some calculation. The only way to find
out is to set it computing and see what happens. Any way to find out would be tantamount
to doing the calculation itself.
“There are no shortcuts in computation,” Dr. Lloyd said.
That means that the more reasonably you try to act, the more unpredictable you are, at
least to yourself, Dr. Lloyd said. Even if your wife knows you will order the chile rellenos,
you have to live your life to find out.
To him that sounds like free will of a sort, for machines as well as for us. Our actions are
determined, but so what? We still don’t know what they will be until the waiter brings the
tray.
That works for me, because I am comfortable with so-called physicalist reasoning, and
I’m always happy to leverage concepts of higher mathematics to cut through
philosophical knots.
The Magician’s Spell
So what about Hitler?
The death of free will, or its exposure as a convenient illusion, some worry, could wreak
havoc on our sense of moral and legal responsibility. According to those who believe that
free will and determinism are incompatible, Dr. Silberstein said in an e-mail message, it
would mean that “people are no more responsible for their actions than asteroids or
planets.” Anything would go.
Dr. Wegner of Harvard said: “We worry that explaining evil condones it. We have to
maintain our outrage at Hitler. But wouldn’t it be nice to have a theory of evil in advance
that could keep him from coming to power?”
He added, “A system a bit more focused on helping people change rather than paying
them back for what they’ve done might be a good thing.”

Dr. Wegner said he thought that exposing free will as an illusion would have little effect
on people’s lives or on their feelings of self-worth. Most of them would remain in denial.
“It’s an illusion, but it’s a very persistent illusion; it keeps coming back,” he said,
comparing it to a magician’s trick that has been seen again and again. “Even though you
know it’s a trick, you get fooled every time. The feelings just don’t go away.”
In an essay about free will in 1999, Dr. Libet wound up quoting the writer Isaac Bashevis
Singer, who once said in an interview with the Paris Review, “The greatest gift which
humanity has received is free choice. It is true that we are limited in our use of free
choice. But the little free choice we have is such a great gift and is potentially worth so
much that for this itself, life is worthwhile living.”
I could skip the chocolate cake, I really could, but why bother? Waiter!
A correction was made on Jan. 4, 2007: An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the
debate over free will misstated the location of Elizabethtown College, where Michael
Silberstein, who commented on free will and popular culture, is a science philosopher. It is

Free will: why people believe in it even when they think they’re
being manipulated

We all like to believe that we are free to make our own choices. At the same time, many people think
that psychological techniques are constantly being used to sway us – from social media trends to
advertising. So how do we square this?
Surprisingly, it’s a question most researchers have ignored until now. But in a series of recent studies,
we asked people, “Where in your day to day life do you think psychological tactics are being used to
manipulate you unconsciously?” – and investigated what that meant for their belief in free will.
In a 2018 study across four countries (Australia, Canada, UK and the USA), responses to the question
above were remarkably similar. In fact, they cut across age, gender, religiosity and political affiliation.

Free will: why people believe in it even when they think they’re being manipulated

Approximately 45% of the examples people gave of psychological manipulation referred to marketing
and advertising – especially “subliminal advertising” (using images or sounds to entice or persuade
people that they aren’t consciously aware of). The next most common (19%) was research (such as
using placebos), then political campaigning (7%), social media (4%) and hypnotherapy (4%).
People typically described methods that subtly change mood, emotions and thoughts in such a way
they that they persuade us into choosing or doing things that we have not consciously consented to.
For instance, shops can pipe the smell of fresh baked bread outside it to entice people in. In a speech,
a politician may emphasise specific words to persuade people to support them. Despite knowing such
a thing could happen, we typically can’t be sure when we were being manipulating in this way.
But do methods such as subliminal messaging actually work? Psychological research has not settled
on an answer to this. But it is interesting to ponder how all this affects our belief in free will.

Rating scenarios
We set out to investigate this topic over the past two years. Across eight studies we presented 1,230
people with scenarios based on the earlier examples people had volunteered in the study conducted in
2018. The scenarios were from a range of contexts (marketing/advertising, research, political
campaigning, social media, therapy).
For each scenario people had to rate the extent to which they believed there was unconscious
manipulation (from none at all to complete manipulation), and the extent to which free choice would
be maintained (from none at all to complete free choice).

Each person had to give ratings of free choice and ratings of unconscious manipulation several times
over because they had to do this for each of the scenarios they were presented with. Totalling up all
the ratings given across all eight studies across all 1,230 participants generated over 14,000 of each of
the two ratings. A total of 3.7% of the 14,000 ratings of free choice were “0” (no free choice at all) and
8.4% were “10” (complete free choice) – with the remainder being somewhere in the between.
These are crude indicators, but they give a reasonable impression that even where manipulation was
described to be occurring, there was proportionally more attributions of complete free choice than of
absolutely none. For ratings of unconscious manipulation, 3.4% were “0” (no unconscious
manipulation) and 9% were “10” (complete unconscious manipulation). So overall, people were more
likely to think they had complete free choice than not at all, but they are also more likely to believe
they were sometimes being manipulated than not at all.
We had expected to find what researchers call a negative correlation. That is, the more people think
they are being manipulated, the less they believe they have free will. But this isn’t what we found. In
the majority of the studies, there was no reliable correlation between the two. How can this be?

Free will: why people believe in it even when they think they’re being manipulated

Justifying beliefs
One reason for this is how we think of the manipulation methods. Chances are we don’t think they’ll
work very well on us, personally – leaving people to believe they remain in charge of their choices.
We did, however, find a difference when people were giving ratings from an impersonal point of view
and when they are asked to imagine themselves in the scenarios. The more vividly people imagined
the possibility of being manipulated, the more they saw this to impinge on their free choice. But
chances are we are biased to think of others as more manipulated than ourselves.
The scenarios weren’t equal either. Some people don’t especially care that there might be
manipulation going on. If marketing tactics and advertising steer us into selecting one cheap brand of
toothpaste compared to another, then as long as we are saving money, it doesn’t matter. So people
justify their belief in free will by assuming manipulation only happens for situations they don’t care
about or that they are actively choosing to be manipulated – they are letting it happen.
That might be a reasonable approach to advertising. But if we are going into a voting booth, we will
want to claim that it is our free choice who we vote for, and not a combination of psychological tactics
that meddled with our unconscious. In such a situation, we are more likely to believe there’s no
manipulation going on, or that we are somehow immune to it.
What the findings from our work tells us is that on a fundamental level we want to preserve a belief
that we are free to choose. But how much we maintain the belief seems to depend on what is at stake.
While this may seem irrational, it is actually rather helpful and healthy. Ultimately, the world as we
know it would totally collapse if we refused to believe we are responsible for our own actions.

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

From chaos to free will
A crude understanding of physics sees
determinism at work in the Universe. Luckily,
molecular uncertainty ensures this isn’t so
by George Ellis

George Ellis is the Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Complex Systems in the
Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape
Town in South Africa. He co-authored The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time
(1973) with Stephen Hawking.

Edited by Sally Davies

T he French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace (17491827) believed that the Universe was a piece of machinery,
and that physics determines everything. Napoleon, who had
read up on Laplace’s work, confronted him about the
conspicuous absence of a creator in his theory. ‘I had no need
of that hypothesis,’ came the reply. Laplace might have said
the same thing about free will, which his mechanistic universe
rendered superfluous.

Since Laplace’s day, scientists, philosophers and even
neuroscientists have followed his lead in denying the
possibility of free will. This reflects a widespread belief among
theoretical physicists that if you know the initial values of the
variables that characterise a physical system, together with the
equations that explain how these variables change over time,
then you can calculate the state of the system at all later times.
For example, if you know the positions and velocities of all the
particles that make up a gas in a container, you can determine
the positions and velocities of all those particles at all later

times. This means that there should be no freedom for any
deviation from this physically determined trajectory.

Consider, then, that everything we see around us – rocks and
planets, frogs and trees, your body and brain – is made up of
nothing but protons, electrons and neutrons put together in
very complex ways. In the case of your body, they make many
kinds of cells; in turn, these cells make tissues, such as muscle
and skin; these tissues make systems, such as the heart, lungs
and brain; and these systems make the body as a whole. It
might seem that everything that’s happening at the higher,
‘emergent’ levels should be uniquely determined by the
physics operating beneath them. This would mean that the
thoughts you’re having at this very moment were
predetermined at the start of the Universe, based on the
values of the particle physics variables at that time.

Now you might be forgiven for doubting whether William
Shakespeare’s sonnets, Winston Churchill’s speeches and the
words in Stephen Hawking’s book A Brief History of Time
(1988) really came into being in this way. And you would be
right to doubt: there are many problems with the skeptics’
position.

At very small scales, quantum theory underlies what’s
happening in the world. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
introduces an unavoidable fuzziness and an irreducible
uncertainty in quantum outcomes. You might know the value
of one variable, such as a particle’s momentum, but that
means you can’t accurately detect another, such as its
position. This seems to fundamentally undermine the
allegedly iron-clad link between initial data and physical
results. However, this is controversial, so I’ll set it aside for
now, as important as it is. Instead, I’ll focus on key aspects of
causation that occur in the molecular biology of neurons in
the brain.

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

One of the most astounding discoveries of the previous
century was that biological activity at the micro level is
literally grounded in the physical shape of biological
molecules, particularly DNA, RNA and proteins. This
discovery became possible only when X-ray crystallography
had progressed to the point of allowing us to determine the
extraordinarily complex detailed structure and foldings of
these molecules.

The structure of these molecules is truly the secret of life, as
Francis Crick and James Watson exclaimed when they
discovered the double helix structure of DNA, helped by the
work of Rosalind Franklin. This deservedly led to huge public
excitement about how DNA molecules encode our genetic
inheritance. However, it is the structure of other molecules –
proteins and associated messenger molecules – that in fact
makes things happen at the cellular level. DNA is important
only because it codes for the proteins that do the real
biological work. For example, haemoglobin in blood cells
transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
Rhodopsin in the eye absorbs light and turns it into electrical
signals. Kinesin and dynein are motor proteins that transport
materials from one place to another in a cell. Enzymes speed
up chemical reactions by such huge amounts that they
essentially turn them on and off. Voltage-gated ion channels
serve as biological versions of transistors, while ligand-gated
ion channels allow messenger molecules (‘ligands’) such as
neurotransmitters to convey information from one cell to
another in the brain. And so it goes. And all this functioning
follows from the details of the complex shapes of these
proteins.

This means that, to link physics and biology, we need to look
at the theory that underlies molecular shape. And that theory
is quantum chemistry, based in the fundamental equation of
quantum physics: the Schrödinger equation. In quantum
theory, the state of a system is described by what’s known as
its wave function, which determines the probabilities of
different outcomes when events take place. The Schrödinger

3/15

23/03/2025, 22:15

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

equation governs how the wave function changes with time.
For example, it governs the process of quantum tunnelling,
which in turn underlies important physical effects such as
how the Sun generates energy via nuclear fusion,
photosynthesis in plants, and flash memories you use to store
data in computer USB flash drives.

I will take for granted the validity of the Schrödinger equation,
which is one of the best-tested equations in physics. To link
this to the functioning of life, we need to apply the
Schrödinger equation to the wave function of the relevant
molecules – in this case, proteins – so as to determine how
their shape will change with time. So the actual question is:
does the Schrödinger equation, together with the initial state
of the wave function describing everything that existed in the
early Universe, determine everything I think today because it
determines the states of all the biomolecules in my body?

T he confounding thing for free-will skeptics is that all
outcomes don’t depend only on the equations and the initial
data. They also depend on constraints. An example is an apple
under the influence of gravity, such as the one that Isaac
Newton watched fall to the ground from a tree at Woolsthorpe
Manor. That was its unconstrained motion.

Now suppose Newton had suspended the apple from a
branch of the tree by a string attached to its stalk. It would
thereby have been turned into a pendulum, because the string
constrained its motion. Instead of dropping to the ground, it
would have swung back and forth in a circular arc under the
branch, with its state of motion determined uniquely by its
initial position and velocity. Consequently, the motions of all
the billions of atoms that make up the apple would then also
be determined by the string. It would make each of them also
move in a circular arc under the support. This is how
constraints shape outcomes.

4/15

23/03/2025, 22:15

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

Now let’s examine variation of the constraint over time. While
the apple was swinging peacefully back and forth, imagine
that Newton cut the string. The apple would then have fallen
to the ground. The initial state (its speed in a circular arc when
it started) no longer determined the outcome. It was the
unexpected cutting of the string that determined what
happened, because it removed the previous constraint. The
moral of the story is that, when constraints vary, outcomes are
not determined by initial conditions; they depend on the way
that the constraints change with time.

In the case of the biomolecules that underlie the existence of
life, it’s the shape of the molecule that acts as a constraint on
what happens. These molecules are quite flexible, bending
around joints rather like hinges. The distances between the
atomic nuclei in the molecules determine what bending is
possible. Any particular such molecular ‘conformation’ (a
specific state of folding) constrains the motions of ions and
electrons at the underlying physical level. This can happen in
a time-dependent fashion, according to biological needs. In
this way, biology can reach down to shape physical outcomes.
It changes constraints in the applicable Schrödinger equation.

A key case are the ion channels in cell walls that separate the
interior of a cell from its exterior. Ions are atoms that have
become electrically charged because they have lost or gained
an electron. Sodium and potassium atoms are positively
charged because they have lost an electron, while chlorine
ions are negatively charged because they have gained an
electron. Ion channels are proteins imbedded in the cell wall,
controlling the flow of ions in and out of the cell. They can be
open or closed, depending on the position of their hinged
parts. They thereby either allow movement of ions into or out
of the cell (depending on their type), or prevent it.

This gating plays a crucial role in brain functioning. For
example, neurons are linked to each other by fibres called
axons. Voltage-gated ion channels in the axon wall open or
https://aeon.co/essays/heres-why-so-many-physicists-are-wrong-about-free-will

5/15

23/03/2025, 22:15

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

close based on the difference in electrical voltage between the
inside and the outside of the cell. The ions moving in and out
of axons through these ion channels cause an electrical signal
to move along the neuron fibres, thus creating the electric
nerve impulses by which we think (called ‘spike chains’,
because they consist of a series of little voltage surges or
‘spikes’). These ion channels are a biological analogue of
transistors in computers, which allow currents to flow or not,
based in the voltage difference between two parts of the
circuit.

Another type of ion channel is a ligand-gated one, which
occurs in the synapses that connect neurons to each other.
The process is a complex biochemical version of opening a
door with a key: it will open only if the key is the right shape
for the specific lock. A ligand, in this case a neurotransmitter,
is a messenger molecule that binds to a receptor on the ion
channel, and so opens it by changing its shape.

Figure 1: Ligand-gated ion channel function. This is how
messenger molecules control physical outcomes inside the cell.

This allows ions to flow into a neuron, changing a chemical to
an electrical signal. The ion channel allows ions to enter a cell
only when a ligand is bound to a receptor and changes the
shape of the ion channel so that it opens. If no ligand is
present, the channel is closed and no ions can enter. The
binding that causes this opening and closing is a consequence
of the particular shape of the ligand: it can bind if and only if it
has precisely the right shape for that specific receptor. The
gating function, then, is a consequence of the detailed shape
of the ion channel.

structures that are the secret of life. Courtesy Wikipedia

This is how signalling molecules alter constraints on the flow
of ions through ion channels in cell walls. The constraints are
different before and after the binding of a messenger
molecule. This time-dependent nature of binding controls ion
flows at the synapses where one neuron joins to another one.
It is these changes of molecular shape, rather than initial
conditions, that determine which specific solutions of the
molecular Schrödinger equation will occur in your brain when
you’re thinking. They underlie the possibility of thought.

S o what determines which messages are conveyed to your
synapses by signalling molecules? They are signals
determined by thinking processes that can’t be described at
any lower level because they involve concepts, cognition and
emotions in an essential way. Psychological experiences drive
what happens. Your thoughts and feelings reach ‘down’ to
shape lower-level processes in the brain by altering the
constraints on ion and electron flows in a way that changes
with time.

For example, suppose you’re walking down the street, and
just in front of you a terrible accident happens – smashed-up
cars, people injured, blood everywhere. You react with horror:
sympathy for those who’ve been hurt, fear that they will die, a
guilty sense of relief that it didn’t happen to you. These are all
mental events that take place because of the way your brain
functions at the psychological level, based on some
combination of past experience and innate responses. None
of those qualities – sympathy, fear, guilt – occur at the ion or
synapse level. These high-level mental operations act down to
alter the shape of ion channels, and so change the motions of
billions of ions and electrons in your brain. In an intricate
causal dance between levels in your brain, those thoughts are
able to occur because of the underlying spike chains, but it’s
their essentially psychological nature – what it means to
recognise an accident, which thoughts flow through your
mind as you decide what to do, what it feels like to experience
the shock of seeing the event – that causes what happens.
Physics enabled what took place in your head and body, but
didn’t determine it; your mental interpretation of the event
did.

Learning and memory offer another example of how
downward causal effect shapes the underlying physics.
Memory is controlled by genes switching on and off, known
as ‘gene regulation’. Genes, made of DNA molecules, contain
the information needed for cells to manufacture specific
proteins at the right place and time. Now there’s a problem
here: nearly every cell in our body has the same genes, and
https://aeon.co/essays/heres-why-so-many-physicists-are-wrong-about-free-will

8/15

23/03/2025, 22:15

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

codes for all the proteins that occur in the rest of the body.
But each cell needs specific proteins to be produced,
depending on context. So identical DNA strands produce
different proteins in different cells at various times. How does
this happen? It occurs by gene regulation: genes being
switched on and off, and so being expressed or not. Gene
regulation is controlled by proteins called transcription
factors. These are regulatory proteins that bind to specific
sites on a DNA molecule that recognise their shape, and so
determine which proteins will be produced when the DNA is
read.

This process of gene regulation strengthens or weakens
neural connections in our brain. The cortex has columns of
densely packed neurons, connected to each other by an
immensely complex network of connections. The broad
structure of that network is the same for everyone, but the
details are not. It’s the detailed structure in each brain that
embodies the differences between us, and specifically our
long-term memories. The details of which neuron is connected
to which, and the strength of each connection, have been
shaped by our own history and memories.

How does any of this happen? As the Austrian-American
doctor Eric Kandel explained in his Nobel Prize Lecture from
2000, the process of learning at the mental level leads to
changed patterns of gene expression, and so specific proteins
being produced, which alter the strengths of neural
connections at synapses. This changes the strength of
connections between neurons, thereby storing memories.

Such learning is a psychological happening. You might
remember your pleasure on eating a delicious meal, the
details of a Yo-Yo Ma rendition of a Bach sonata, or the
painful memory of the car crash. Once again, these are
irreducible psychological events: they can’t be described at
any lower level. They reach down to alter neuronal
connections over time. These changes can’t be predicted on

9/15

23/03/2025, 22:15

Here’s why so many physicists are wrong about free will | Aeon Essays

the basis of the initial state of the neural connections (your
neurons did not know that the car crash was about to happen)
– but, afterwards, they constrain electron flows differently,
because connections have changed. Learning changes
structure at the macro scale (we have a ‘plastic brain’), which
reaches down to alter micro connections and the details of
electron flows at the bottom.

Another case in point is rational thought. In about 500 BCE,
the Pythagoreans discovered something startling: that the
square root of two is irrational. That is, if 2 is the product of a
number N with itself (N times N is 2), then N can’t be
expressed as a ratio of whole numbers, for example N cannot
be 3/2. This was so shocking that the discovery was treated as
an official secret. It wasn’t something they wished to be true,
and it was dangerous to know it.

This scandalous conclusion was reached by rational argument
according to mathematical rules – rules that shaped the
processes that took place in the brain of Hippasus of
Metapontum. Abstract logic was driving those brain
operations at all levels from the psychological (‘What ratio of
integral numbers gives me the square root of 2?’) to electrical
impulses flying along nerve fibres, to the ions moving in and
out of those fibres through ion channels, to the interactions
between electrons and protons that enabled the whole thing
to happen.

We don’t know the details of how thoughts are encoded by
spike chains, but we do know this coding must occur. The
spike trains must somehow reflect the structure of the logical
argument that the square root of 2 is irrational. If we
memorise this proof, the mathematical argument reaches
down to reshape neuronal connections via gene regulation as
the memory is stored. The logical argument is then literally
embodied in details of brain connections.

W hat these instances show is that psychological
understandings reach down to shape the motions of ions and
electrons by altering constraints at the physics-level over time.
That is, mental states change the shape of proteins because
the brain has real logical powers. This downward causation
trumps the power of initial conditions. Logical implications
determine the outcomes at the macro level in our thoughts,
and at the micro level in terms of flows of electrons and ions.

These examples are of course contentious because they
involve the human brain and thought, and implicitly the issue
of free will. However, the analogous issue also arises in the
case of computer algorithms. An algorithm working out
answers to specific questions – What pages will Google
display to you? How much can you withdraw with this credit
card? Can I book the 8:45am train tomorrow? – is again
based in abstract logic. This logic is explicitly coded in a
computer program written in a high-level programming
language such as FORTRAN, Java or Python.

The equations at the foundations of physics have no direct
relation to such algorithms. But computer programs are
clearly causally effective: they alter outcomes in the world.
Programs determine what happens according to the logic of
the algorithm acting on the relevant data. This is what
computer science students study. That logic cascades down to
the digital level, where it determines what happens to electron
flows by altering applied voltages that change the structure of
electron conduction channels in transistors. Before the
program is loaded into the computer, the relevant algorithm is
not represented in its innards; after the program is loaded, it
is. Constraints at the macro level have been changed by
loading the program. The physics dances to the tune of the
algorithm, as voltages at the micro level change microsecond
by microsecond during the program execution.

Free-will skeptics ignore the kind of time-dependent
constraints that I discuss here, which enable downwards

causation in biology in general and brain function in
particular. Of course, nothing about molecular biology
contradicts the physics that underlies all material existence.
Rather, it provides an extraordinarily complex context where
things work out according to that context. Even though our
brains are indeed made up of fundamental particles, highlevel function emerges through the interaction of upward and
downward causal processes.

But still a nagging thought occurs: if the initial data were
known for the entire Universe, then why can’t it determine all
these lower-level dynamics in a mechanistic way? After all,
aren’t they just smallscale details in this larger picture, where
one can claim that no constraints occur? The Universe is by
definition all that there is, so it can’t be constrained by effects
from a larger environment. Might physics not be deterministic
in that case, and my argument fall apart?

The response is twofold. First, there’s a major element of
randomness in what happens both in cosmology at large
scales and in molecular biology at small scales. At the large
scales, in cosmology we have difficulty in getting the details of
what happens right, even at galactic scales; we work only with
statistical likelihoods. There are significant unsolved
problems, such as how dark matter clumps around galaxies at
scales hugely greater than that of the solar system. We can’t
realistically determine from studies based in the initial
conditions in cosmology what happens at smaller scales such
as that of the Sun or Earth. There’s no hope whatsoever of
predicting details down to the scale of the human body.

However, skeptics still say that it’s just a matter of lacking
enough data and computing power. In principle, it could
work. But actually, it won’t, because of what happens at the
microscale. At molecular scales, the processes at work forget
initial data due to billions on billions of collisions between
molecules every second. Biology thrives on that disorder – a
‘molecular storm’, as Peter Hoffman calls it in his book Life’s
https://aeon.co/essays/heres-why-so-many-physicists-are-wrong-about-free-will

12/15

Ratchet (2012). Molecular machines do work, such as kinesin
moving cargos from one place to another in the cell,
extracting order out of the chaos. Far from physics having the
determinate nature envisaged by Laplace, all the molecules’
argy-bargy every microsecond means that the details of their
initial state of motion are irretrievably lost. It’s this molecularlevel chaotic motion that prevents micro-determinism in
practice.

But how can order emerge out of this chaos? As explained by
Denis Noble and Raymond Noble in their paper for the
journal Chaos in 2018, molecular randomness gives cellular
mechanisms the option of choosing the outcomes they want,
and discarding those they don’t. This power of choice enables
physiological systems such as the heart and brain to function
in a way that isn’t enslaved by the lower-level interactions, but
rather choosing the outcomes of the preferred interactions
from a multitude of options. In this way, a layer of order can
emerge from the disorder – and micro data – at the lower
level. This isn’t conclusive proof that free will exists, but at
least it opens up a way for it to exist.

F or the sake of argument, let’s suppose I’m wrong. Let’s
ignore all these issues and take the deterministic view
seriously. It implies that the words of every book ever written
– the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Das Kapital, the Harry Potter
series – were encoded into the initial state of the Universe,
whatever that was. No logical thinking by a human played a
causal role in the specific words of these books: they were
determined by physics alone.

It’s unclear how any words could have been encoded into the
Universe, which led to apparently random fluctuations at the
time when matter and radiation decoupled from each other.
How would they have been represented in those fluctuations?
It’s virtually impossible that they could have affected the
detailed brain-state of the authors when they wrote their
books. The issue of quantum uncertainty adds another layer

23/03/2025, 22:15

of implausibility to these claims. But let’s set all these major
issues aside for now. Let’s suppose it is indeed possible that
present-day brain-states are determined by initial conditions
in the Universe, because causally deterministic physics
underlies all.

The problem then is, how did all those words get there? Was
there a demiurge who coded all that stuff into the detailed
initial state of the Universe? It’s certainly not there in the
Schrödinger equation per se, or in a randomly determined set
of fluctuations in the early Universe as is normally envisaged
in cosmological studies. By definition, they don’t encode
either any detailed information or any logical argumentation.

So how could that data have got there? Not just for one book,
but for all the books ever written? Is that really a believable
story, or some kind of creationist myth?

Genuine mental functioning and the ability to make decisions
in a rational way is a far more persuasive explanation of how
books get written. That this is possible is due to the
extraordinary hierarchical structure of our brain and its
functioning. And that functioning is enabled by downward
causation from the psychological to the physical levels, with
outcomes at the physics level determined by constraints that
change over time. No violation of physical laws need occur.

Physics has made huge strides since the days of Laplace;
indeed, it would be completely unrecognisable to him. Yet
there are still physicists today who confidently proclaim that
we can’t have free will because physics determines everything,
including brain functioning – entirely ignoring the complex
context and the power of constraints.

If you seriously believe that fundamental forces leave no space
for free will, then it’s impossible for us to genuinely make
choices as moral beings. We wouldn’t be accountable in any

would in reality be governing our behaviour, and
responsibility wouldn’t enter into the picture.

The way I see it, the illusion of having free will (whatever that means) stems from our
inability to take into account the many factors that go into our every thought and
action. In that sense, the bare minimum that an organism would seem to need to
exhibit free will is a consciousness that is complex enough to show signs of
introspection, but not so complex as to be able to process all those factors.

How complex does an organism have to be to exhibit free will? | New Scientist

I am intrigued that this question on free will was originally posed in the same issue of
New Scientist as an article about sophisticated AI (9 October, p36

🔗

/article/mg25133550-800-supersized-ais-are-truly-intelligent-machines-just-amatter-of-scale/). If the brain is indeed a super-complex computer, then free will is
certainly an illusion. There is no evidence that there is anything in the brain other
than synapses firing in response to stimuli.
In which case, the best we can do to assert something akin to free will might be to
choose to determine an outcome based on the toss of a coin. Only by doing this can we
be sure that the decision wasn’t predetermined by a combination of various inputs,
from education to indigestion!
Peter Basford
Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, UK
A brain exists to receive inputs from external and internal sensors. From these, it
forms a model of the world, with the organism in it, and takes decisions as to what to
do based on that model.

“The bare minimum an organism
would need to exhibit free will is a
consciousness that is complex enough
to show introspection”
The more sophisticated the brain, the more sophisticated the model and the more
options the organism has to choose from – and the less likely it is to produce the same
decision in similar circumstances.
The moth isn’t capable of perceiving an option of not banging into a hot light bulb,
but a fox or a human can update their models of the world to change their options and
their decisions in the light of experience.

How much do our genes restrict free will?

Social media algorithms, artificial intelligence, and our own genetics are among the factors
influencing us beyond our awareness. This raises an ancient question: do we have control over our
own lives? This article is part of The Conversation’s series on the science of free will.

Many of us believe we are masters of own destiny, but new research is revealing the extent to which
our behaviour is influenced by our genes.
It’s now possible to decipher our individual genetic code, the sequence of 3.2 billion DNA “letters”
unique to each of us, that forms a blueprint for our brains and bodies.

How much do our genes restrict free will?

This sequence reveals how much of our behaviour has a hefty biological predisposition, meaning we
might be skewed towards developing a particular attribute or characteristic. Research has shown
genes may predispose not only our height, eye colour or weight, but also our vulnerability to mental
ill-health, longevity, intelligence and impulsivity. Such traits are, to varying degrees, written into our
genes — sometimes thousands of genes working in concert.
Most of these genes instruct how our brain circuitry is laid down in the womb, and how it functions.
We can now view a baby’s brain as it is built, even 20 weeks before birth. Circuitry changes exist in
their brains that strongly correlate with genes that predispose for autism spectrum disorder and
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They even predispose for conditions that might not
emerge for decades: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia.

school

Increasingly we are faced with the prospect that predispositions to more complex behaviours are
similarly wired into our brains. These include which religion we choose, how we form our political
ideologies, and even how we create our friendship groups.

Scientists are revealing that our genes predispose us to certain complex behaviours like how we form
our political beliefs, not only superficial things like hair and eye colour. Glenn Hunt/AAP

Nature and nurture are intertwined
There are also other ways our life stories can be passed down through generations, besides being
inscribed in our DNA.
“Epigenetics” is a relatively new area of science that can reveal how intertwined nature and nurture
can be. It looks not at changes to genes themselves, but instead at the “tags” that are put on genes
from life experience, which alter how our genes are expressed.

One 2014 study looked at epigenetic changes in mice. Mice love the sweet smell of cherries, so when a
waft reaches their nose, a pleasure zone in the brain lights up, motivating them to scurry around and
hunt out the treat. The researchers decided to pair this smell with a mild electric shock, and the mice
quickly learned to freeze in anticipation.

Read more: Epigenetics: what impact does it have on our psychology?

The study found this new memory was transmitted across the generations. The mice’s grandchildren
were fearful of cherries, despite not having experienced the electric shocks themselves. The
grandfather’s sperm DNA changed its shape, leaving a blueprint of the experience entwined in the
genes.
This is ongoing research and novel science, so questions remain about how these mechanisms might
apply to humans. But preliminary results indicate epigenetic changes can influence descendants of
extremely traumatic events.
One study showed the sons of US Civil War prisoners had an 11% higher death rate by their mid-40s.
Another small study showed survivors of the Holocaust, and their children, carried epigenetic changes
in a gene that was linked to their levels of cortisol, a hormone involved in the stress response. It’s a
complicated picture, but the results suggest descendants have a higher net cortisol level and are
therefore more susceptible to anxiety disorders.

Do we have any scope for free will?
Of course, it’s not simply the case that our lives are set in stone by the brain we’re born with, the DNA
given to us by our parents, and the memories passed down from our grandparents.
There is, thankfully, still scope for change. As we learn, new connections form between nerve cells. As
the new skill is practised, or the learning relived, the connections strengthen and the learning is
consolidated into a memory. If the memory is repeatedly visited, it will become the default route for
electrical signals in the brain, meaning learned behaviour becomes habit.
Take riding a bike, for example. We don’t know how to ride one when we are born, but through trial
and error, and a few small crashes along the way, we can learn to do it.

Similar principles create the basis for both perception and navigation. We make and strengthen
neural connections as we move around our environment and conjure our perception of the space that
surrounds us.
But there’s a catch: sometimes our past learnings blind us to future truths. Watch the video below —
we’re all biased towards seeing faces in our environment. This preference causes us to ignore the
shadow cues telling us it is the back end of a mask. Instead, we rely on tried and tested routes within
our brains, generating the image of another face.

You probably won’t notice that Albert Einstein’s face is the back side of a mask, rather than the front,
because our brains are biased towards seeing faces in our environment.

This illusion illustrates how difficult it can be to change our minds. Our identity and expectations are
based on past experiences. It can take too much cognitive energy to break down the frameworks in
our minds.

Elegant machinery
As I explore in my latest book published last year, The Science of Fate, this research touches on one of
life’s biggest mysteries: our individual capacity for choice.
For me, there’s something beautiful about viewing ourselves as elegant machinery. Input from the
world is processed in our unique brains to produce the output that is our behaviour.

However, many of us may not wish to relinquish the idea of being free agents. Biological determinism,
the idea that human behaviour is entirely innate, rightly makes people nervous. It’s abhorrent to think
that appalling acts in our history were perpetrated by people who were powerless to stop them,
because that raises the spectre that they might happen again.
Perhaps instead, we could think of ourselves as not being restricted by our genes. Acknowledging the
biology that influences our individuality may then empower us to better pool our strengths and
harness our collective cognitive capacity to shape the world for the better.

How Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your
"Free" Will

Physics and neurobiology can help us understand whether we choose our
own destiny

BY CHRISTOF KOCH
May 2012 Issue

Mind & Brain

In a remote corner of the universe, on a small blue planet gravitating around
a humdrum sun in the outer districts of the Milky Way, organisms arose
from the primordial mud and ooze in an epic struggle for survival that
spanned aeons.
Despite all evidence to the contrary, these bipedal creatures thought of
themselves as extraordinarily privileged, occupying a unique place in a
cosmos of a trillion trillion stars. Conceited as they were, they believed that
they, and only they, could escape the iron law
of cause and effect that governs everything. They could do this by virtue of
something they called free will, which allowed them to do things without
any material reason.
Can you truly act freely? The question of free will is no mere philosophical
banter; it engages people in a way that few other metaphysical questions do.
It is the bedrock of society’s notions of responsibility, praise and blame.
Ultimately it is about the degree of control you exert over your life.
Let’s say you are living with a loving and lovely spouse. A chance meeting
with a stranger turns this life utterly upside down. You begin talking for
hours on the phone, you share your innermost secrets, you start an affaire de

coeur. You realize perfectly well that this is all wrong from an ethical point of
view; it will wreak havoc with many lives, with no guarantee of a happy and
productive future. Yet something in you yearns for change.
Such gut-churning choices confront you with the question of how much say
you really have in the matter. You feel that you could, in principle, break off
the affair. Despite many attempts, you somehow never manage to do so.
In my thoughts on these matters of free will, I neglect millennia of learned
philosophical debates and focus on what physics, neurobiology and
psychology have to say, for they have provided partial answers to this
ancient conundrum.
Shades of Freedom
I recently served on a jury in United States District Court in Los Angeles.
The defendant was a heavily tattooed member of a street gang that smuggled
and sold drugs. He was charged with murdering a fellow gang member with
two shots to the head.
As the background to the crime was laid out by law enforcement, relatives,
and present and past gang members—some of them testifying while
handcuffed, shackled and dressed in bright orange prison jumpsuits—I
thought about the individual and societal forces that had shaped the
defendant. Did he ever have a choice? Did his violent upbringing make it
inevitable that he would kill? Fortunately, the jury was not called on to
answer these irresolvable questions or to determine his punishment. We
only had to decide, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether he was guilty as
charged, whether he had shot a particular person at a particular place and
time. And this we did.
According to what some call the strong definition of free will, articulated by
René Descartes in the 17th century, you are free if, under identical
circumstances, you could have acted otherwise. Identical circumstances refer
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/finding-free-will/

24/03/2025, 10:34

to not only the same external conditions but also the same brain states. The
soul freely chooses this way or that, making the brain act out its wishes, like
a driver who takes a car down this road or that one. This view is the one
most regular folks believe in.
Contrast this strong notion of freedom with a more pragmatic conception
called compatibilism, the dominant view in biological, psychological, legal
and medical circles. You are free if you can follow your own desires and
preferences. A long-term smoker who wants to quit but who lights up again
and again is not free. His desire is thwarted by his addiction. Under this
definition, few of us are completely free.
It is the rare individual—Mahatma Gandhi comes to mind—who can steel
himself to withhold sustenance for weeks on end for a higher ethical
purpose. Another extreme case of iron self-control is the self-immolation of
Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc in 1963 to protest the repressive regime
in South Vietnam. What is so singular about this event, captured in
haunting photographs, is the calm and deliberate nature of his heroic act.
While burning to death, Duc remained in the meditative lotus position,
without moving a muscle or uttering a sound, as the flames consumed him.
For the rest of us, who struggle to avoid going for dessert, freedom is always
a question of degree rather than an absolute good that we do or do not
possess.
Criminal law recognizes instances of diminished responsibility. The husband
who beats his wife’s lover to death in a blind rage when he catches them in
flagrante delicto is considered less guilty than if he had sought revenge
weeks later in a cold, premeditated manner. Norwegian Anders Breivik,
who shot more than 60 people in a cold-blooded and calculated manner in
July 2011, is a paranoid schizophrenic who was found to be criminally insane
and will probably be confined to a psychiatric institution. Contemporary

society and the judicial system are built on such a pragmatic, psychological
notion of freedom.
But I want to dig deeper. I want to unearth the underlying causes of actions
that are traditionally thought of as “free.”
A Clockwork Universe
In 1687 Isaac Newton published his Principia, which enunciated the law of
universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. Newton’s second law
links the force brought on a system—a billiard ball rolling on a green felt
table—to its acceleration. This law has profound consequences, for it
implies that the positions and velocities of all the components making up an
entity at any particular moment, together with the forces between them,
unalterably determine that entity’s fate—that is, its future location and
speed.
This is the essence of determinism. The mass, location and velocities of the
planets as they travel in their orbits around the sun determine where they
will be in a thousand, a million or a billion years from today, provided only
that all the forces acting on them are properly accounted for. The universe,
once set in motion, runs its course inexorably, like a clockwork.
A full-blown setback for the notion that the future can be accurately forecast
was revealed in the form of deterministic chaos. The late meteorologist
Edward Lorenz came across it while solving three simple mathematical
equations characterizing the motion of the atmosphere. The solution
predicted by his computer program varied widely when he entered starting
values that differed by only tiny amounts. This is the hallmark of chaos:
infinitesimally small perturbations in the equations’ starting points lead to
radically different outcomes. In 1972 Lorenz coined the term “butterfly
effect” to denote this extreme sensitivity to initial conditions: the beating of

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/finding-free-will/

a butterfly’s wings creates barely perceptible ripples in the atmosphere that
ultimately alter the path of a tornado elsewhere.
Remarkably, such a butterfly effect was found in celestial mechanics, the
epitome of the clockwork universe. Planets majestically ride gravity’s
geodesics, propelled by the initial rotation of the cloud that formed the solar
system. It came as a mighty surprise, therefore, when computer modeling in
the 1990s demonstrated that Pluto has a chaotic orbit, with a divergence
time of millions of years. Astronomers cannot be certain whether Pluto will
be on this side of the sun (relative to Earth’s position) or the other side 10
million years from now! If this uncertainty holds for a planet with a
comparatively simple internal makeup, moving in the vacuum of space
under a sole force, gravitation, what does it portend for the predictability of
a person, a tiny insect or an itsy-bitsy nerve cell, all of which are swayed by
countless factors?
Chaos does not invalidate the natural law of cause and effect, however. It
continues to reign supreme. Planetary physicists aren’t quite sure where
Pluto will be aeons from now, but they are confident that its orbit will
always be completely in thrall to gravity. What breaks down in chaos is not
the chain of action and reaction, but predictability. The universe is still a
gigantic clockwork, even though we can’t be sure where the minute and
hour hands will point a week hence.
Origins of Uncertainty
The deathblow to the Newtonian dream—or nightmare, in my opinion—
was the celebrated quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle, formulated
by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. In its most common interpretation, it avers
that any particle, say, a photon of light or an electron, cannot have both a
definite position and a definite momentum at the same time. If you know its
speed accurately, its position is correspondingly ill defined, and vice versa.

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a radical departure from classical
physics. It replaces dogmatic certainty with ambiguity.
Consider an experiment that ends with a 90 percent chance of an electron
being here and a 10 percent chance of it being over there. If the experiment
were repeated 1,000 times, on about 900 trials, give or take a few, the
electron would be here; otherwise, it would be over there. Yet this statistical
outcome does not ordain where the electron will be on the next trial. Albert
Einstein could never reconcile himself to this random aspect of nature. It is
in this context that he famously pronounced, “Der Alte würfelt nicht” (the Old
Man, that is, God, does not play dice).
The universe has an irreducible, random character. If it is a clockwork, its
cogs, springs and levers are not Swiss-made; they do not follow a
predetermined path. Physical determinism has been replaced by the
determinism of probabilities. Nothing is certain anymore.
But wait—I hear a serious objection. There is no question that the
macroscopic world of human experience is built on the microscopic,
quantum world. Yet that does not imply that everyday objects such as cars
inherit all the weird properties of quantum mechanics. When I park my red
Mini convertible, it has zero velocity relative to the pavement. Because it is
enormously heavy compared with an electron, the fuzziness associated with
its position is, to all intents and purposes, zero.
Cars have comparatively simple internal structures. The brains of bees,
beagles and boys, by comparison, are vastly more heterogeneous, and the
components out of which they are constructed have a noisy character.
Randomness is apparent everywhere in their nervous system, from sensory
neurons picking up sights and smells to motor neurons controlling the
body’s muscles. We cannot rule out the possibility that quantum
indeterminacy likewise leads to behavioral indeterminacy.

Such randomness may play a functional role. If a housefly pursued by a
predator makes a sudden, abrupt turn midflight, it is more likely to see the
light of another day than its more predictable companion. Thus, evolution
might favor circuits that exploit quantum randomness for certain acts or
decisions. Both quantum mechanics and deterministic chaos lead to
unpredictable outcomes.
Afterthought to Action
Let me return to solid ground and tell you about a classical experiment that
convinced many people that free will must be an illusion. This experiment
was conceived and carried out in the early 1980s by Benjamin Libet, a
neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Francisco.
The brain and the sea have one thing in common—both are ceaselessly in
commotion. One way to visualize this is to record the tiny fluctuations in
the electrical potential on the outside of the scalp, a few millionths of a volt
in size, using an electroencephalograph (EEG). Like the recording of a
seismometer, the EEG trace moves feverishly up and down, registering
unseen tremors in the cerebral cortex underneath. Whenever the person
being tested is about to move a limb, an electrical potential builds up. Called
the readiness potential, it precedes the actual onset of movement by one
second or longer.
Intuitively, the sequence of events that leads to a voluntary act must be as
follows: You decide to raise your hand; your brain communicates that
intention to the neurons responsible for planning and executing hand
movements; and those neurons relay the appropriate commands to the
motor neurons that contract the arm muscles. But Libet was not convinced.
Wasn’t it more likely that the mind and the brain acted simultaneously or
even that the brain acted before the mind did?

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/finding-free-will/

7/12

24/03/2025, 10:34

How Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your "Free" Will | Scientific American

Libet set out to determine the timing of a mental event, a person’s deliberate
decision, and to compare that with the timing of a physical event, the onset
of the readiness potential after that decision. He projected onto a screen a
point of bright light that went around and around, like the tip of the minute
hand on a clock. With EEG electrodes on his or her head, each volunteer
had to spontaneously, but deliberately, flex a wrist. They did this while
noting the position of the light when they became aware of the urge to act.
The results told an unambiguous story, which was bolstered by later
experiments. The beginning of the readiness potential precedes the
conscious decision to move by at least half a second and often by much
longer. The brain acts before the mind decides! This discovery was a
complete reversal of the deeply held intuition of mental causation.
The Conscious Experience of Will
Why don’t you repeat this experiment right now: go ahead and flex your
wrist. You experience three allied yet distinct feelings associated with the
plan to move (intention), your willing of the movement (a feeling called
agency or authorship), and the actual movement. If a friend were to take
your hand and bend it, you would experience the movement but neither
intention nor agency; that is, you would not feel responsible for the wrist
movement. This is a neglected idea in the debate about free will—that the
mind-body nexus creates a specific, conscious experience of “I willed this” or
“I am the author of this action.”
Daniel Wegner, a psychologist at Harvard University, is one of the
trailblazers of the modern study of volition. In one experiment, Wegner
asked a volunteer to wear gloves and stand in front of a mirror, her arms
hanging by her sides. Directly behind her stood a lab member, dressed
identically. He extended his arms under her armpits, so that when the
woman looked into the mirror, his two gloved hands appeared to be her
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/finding-free-will/

8/12

24/03/2025, 10:34

own. Both participants wore headphones through which Wegner issued
instructions, such as “clap your hands” or “snap your left fingers.” The
volunteer was supposed to report on the extent to which the actions of the
lab member’s hands were her own. When she heard Wegner’s directions
prior to the man’s hands carrying them out, she reported an enhanced
feeling of having willed the action herself, compared with when Wegner’s
instructions came after the man had already moved his hands.
The reality of these feelings of intention has been underscored by
neurosurgeons, who must occasionally probe brain tissue with brief pulses
of electric current. In the course of such explorations, Itzhak Fried, a
surgeon at U.C.L.A., stimulated the presupplementary motor area, which is
part of the vast expanse of cerebral cortex lying in front of the primary
motor cortex. He found that such stimulation can trigger the urge to move a
limb. Michel Desmurget of INSERM and Angela Sirigu of the Institute of
Cognitive Science in France discovered something similar when stimulating
the posterior parietal cortex, an area responsible for transforming visual
information into motor commands. Patients commented, “It felt like I
wanted to move my foot. Not sure how to explain,” or “I had a desire to roll
my tongue in my mouth.” Their feelings arose from within, without any
prompting by the examiner.
Free the Mind
I have taken two lessons from these insights. First, I have adopted a more
pragmatic conception of free will. I strive to live as free of constraints as
possible. The only exception should be restrictions that I deliberately and
consciously impose on myself, chief among them restraints motivated by
ethical concerns: do not hurt others and try to leave the planet a better place
than you found it. Other considerations include family life, health, financial
stability and mindfulness. Second, I try to understand my unconscious

24/03/2025, 10:34

motivations, desires and fears better. I reflect deeper about my own actions
and emotions than my younger self did.
I am breaking no new ground here—these are lessons wise men from all
cultures have taught for millennia. The ancient Greeks had “gnothi seauton”
(“know thyself”) inscribed above the entrance to the Temple of Apollo at
Delphi. The Jesuits have a nearly 500-year-old spiritual tradition that
emphasizes a twice-daily examination of conscience. This constant internal
interrogation sharpens your sensitivity to your actions, desires and
motivations. This will enable you not only to understand yourself better but
also to live a life more in harmony with your character and your long-term
goals.

Is Free Will an Illusion?

Don't trust your instincts about free will or consciousness, experimental
philosophers say

BY SHAUN NICHOLS
November 2011 Issue

Mind & Brain

IT SEEMS OBVIOUS to me that I have free will. When I have just made a
decision, say, to go to a concert, I feel that I could have chosen to do
something else. Yet many philosophers say this instinct is wrong. According
to their view, free will is a figment of our imagination. No one has it or ever
will. Rather our choices are either determined—necessary outcomes of the
events that have happened in the past—or they are ­random.
Our intuitions about free will, however, challenge this nihilistic view. We
could, of course, simply dismiss our intuitions as wrong. But psychology
suggests that doing so would be premature: our hunches often track the
truth pretty well [see “The Powers and Perils of Intuition,” by David G.
Myers; Scientific American Mind, June/July 2007]. For example, if you do not
know the answer to a question on a test, your first guess is more likely to be
right. In both philosophy and science, we may feel there is something fishy
about an argument or an experiment before we can identify exactly what the
problem is.
The debate over free will is one example in which our intuitions conflict
with scientific and philosophical arguments. Something similar holds for
intuitions about consciousness, morality, and a host of other existential
concerns. Typically philosophers deal with these issues through careful

thought and discourse with other theorists. In the past decade, however, a
small group of philosophers have adopted more data-driven methods to
illuminate some of these confounding questions. These so-called
experimental philosophers administer surveys, measure reaction times and
image brains to understand the sources of our instincts. If we can figure out
why we feel we have free will, for example, or why we think that
consciousness consists of something more than patterns of neural activity in
our brain, we might know whether to give credence to those feelings. That
is, if we can show that our intuitions about free will emerge from an
untrustworthy process, we may decide not to trust those beliefs.
Unknown Influences
To discover the psychological basis for philosophical problems,
experimental philosophers often survey people about their views on charged
issues. For instance, scholars have argued about whether individuals actually
believe that their choices are independent of the past and the laws of nature.
Experimental philosophers have tried to resolve the debate by asking study
participants whether they agree with descriptions such as the following:
Imagine a universe in which everything that happens is completely caused by
whatever happened before it. So what happened in the beginning of the universe
caused what happened next and so on, right up to the present. If John decided to
have french fries at lunch one day, this decision, like all others, was caused by what
happened before it.
When surveyed, Americans say they disagree with such descriptions of the
universe. From inquiries in other countries, researchers have found that
Chinese, Colombians and Indians share this opinion: individual choice is
not determined. Why do humans hold this view? One promising
explanation is that we presume that we can generally sense all the influences
on our decision making—and because we cannot detect deterministic
influences, we discount them.

Of course, people do not believe they have conscious access to everything in
their mind. We do not presume to intuit the causes of headaches, memory
formation or visual processing. But research indicates that people do think
they can access the factors affecting their choices.
Yet psychologists widely agree that unconscious processes exert a powerful
influence over our choices. In one study, for example, participants solved
word puzzles in which the words were either associated with rudeness or
politeness. Those exposed to rudeness words were much more likely to
interrupt the experimenter in a subsequent part of the task. When
debriefed, none of the subjects showed any awareness that the word puzzles
had affected their behavior. That scenario is just one of many in which our
decisions are directed by forces lurking beneath our awareness.
Thus, ironically, because our subconscious is so powerful in other ways, we
cannot truly trust it when considering our notion of free will. We still do
not know conclusively that our choices are determined. Our intuition,
however, provides no good reason to think that they are not. If our instinct
cannot support the idea of free will, then we lose our main rationale for
resisting the claim that free will is an illusion.
Is Consciousness Just a Brain Process?
Though a young movement, experimental philosophy is broad in scope. Its
proponents apply their methods to varied philosophical problems, including
questions about the nature of the self. For example, what (if anything) makes
you the same person from childhood to adulthood? They investigate issues
in ethics, too: Do people think that morality is objective, as is mathematics,
and if so, why? Akin to the question of free will, they are also tackling the
dissonance between our intuitions and scientific theories of consciousness.

Scientists have postulated that consciousness is populations of neurons
firing in certain brain areas, no more and no less. To most people, however,
it seems bizarre to think that the distinctive tang of kumquats, say, is just a
pattern of neural activation.
Our instincts about consciousness are triggered by specific cues,
experimental philosophers explain, among them the existence of eyes and
the appearance of goal-directed behavior, but not neurons. Studies indicate
that people’s intuitions tell them that insects—which, of course, have eyes
and show goal-directed behavior—can feel happiness, pain and anger.
The problem is that insects very likely lack the neural wherewithal for these
sensations and emotions. What is more, engineers have programmed robots
to display simple goal-directed behaviors, and these robots can produce the
uncanny impression that they have feelings, even though the machines are
not remotely plausible candidates for having awareness. In short, our
instincts can lead us astray on this matter, too. Maybe consciousness does
not have to be something different from—or above and beyond—brain
processes.
Philosophical conflicts over such concepts as free will and consciousness
often have their roots in ordinary intuitions, and the historical debates often
end in stalemates. Experimental philosophers maintain that we can move
past some of these impasses if we understand the nature of our gut feelings.
This nascent field will probably not produce a silver bullet to fully restore or
discredit our beliefs in free will and other potential illusions. But by
understanding why we find certain philosophical views intuitively
compelling, we might find ourselves in a position to recognize that, in some
cases, we have little reason to hold onto our hunches.

James Gleick, interviewed by Daniel Drake | The New York Review of Books

James Gleick opens his essay from our January 18 issue with a bang:
“Nobody was holding a gun to your head when you started reading
this. You made a choice.” From this playful premise, he examines
where philosophical questions of free will converge with science,
making the case for human agency by teasing out which physical
processes give rise to volition. He quotes the neuroscientist Kevin
Mitchell: “The universe doesn’t have purpose, but life does.”
Gleick is the author of seven books, including biographies of Isaac
Newton and Richard Feynman, an introduction to chaos theory, and a
history of information, which won the 2012 PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary
Science Writing Award. Since 2008 he has written twenty articles for
the Review, on subjects ranging from dictionaries to death. He was also
one of the inspirations for the character Ian Malcolm in Michael
Crichton’s Jurassic Park.
I wrote Gleick last week to ask him about chaos theory, how to test for
free will, and whether we’ll know if AI has gained consciousness
before it’s too late.

Daniel Drake: Early in your essay, you note that Kevin Mitchell employs
a “complex-systems perspective” in his thinking about biological
organisms and free will, as opposed to a “reductionist” approach, like that
taken by physicists or neuroscientists who focus on smaller or more
fundamental parts and processes. Could you explain a little what is meant
by “complex systems”? I have an intuitive sense of how it contrasts with
reductionism, and of what it would mean to try to model highly
contingent, multiply determined processes, but is there a more concrete
scientific definition?
James Gleick: Complex-systems theory arose alongside chaos theory
as a discipline unto itself in the 1970s and 1980s. The climate is a
canonical complex system, as are the brain, the global economy,
immune systems, food webs, epidemics, social networks—entities
made up of many different parts, interacting and interdependent.
Complex systems can behave in chaotic and unpredictable ways, yet
they reveal patterns and structures that carry over from one discipline
to another.
The more traditional reductionist program in science looks for
explanations at the deepest or smallest levels, where fundamental
particles might reveal basic laws. The great Steven Weinberg, a proud
reductionist, felt the rise of complexity theory was a rebuke to his
specialty, particle physics. “There is a low-intensity culture war going
on,” he wrote in this magazine two decades ago, “between scientists
who specialize in free-floating theories of this sort and those (mostly
particle physicists) who pursue the old reductionist dream of finding
laws of nature that are not explained by anything else, but that lie at
the roots of all chains of explanation.”

James Gleick, interviewed by Daniel Drake | The New York Review of Books

What vindicates the complex-systems people, as I see it, is the
recognition of “emergent behaviors,” unexpected phenomena that
arise from seemingly simple interactions. Organized strategies for
foraging and defense emerge in ant colonies, demonstrating a
collective intelligence that can’t be found in individual ants. Emergent
behaviors are seen in traffic patterns, computer networks, and, of
course, brains. All the fun stuff, in other words. Mitchell’s rebuke to
Weinberg would be, you can’t reduce biology to physics. A complexity
theorist says that even when you learn everything there is to know
about neurons and synapses, you’ll still fail to capture what’s really
going on when we think, feel, or act. You can write down all the
equations of fluid dynamics and still be surprised by a tornado.
You convincingly cast doubt on the Libet experiments, which used
electrodes attached to subjects’ brains to discover neuronal activity in
advance of any awareness of a decision. Do you know of an experimental
design, or even a thought experiment, that might more convincingly tell
the difference between free will and determinism?
Here’s an experiment that proves we don’t have free will—no
electrodes required. Arrange the subject in a seated position with legs
dangling freely. Place one hand behind the knee, and with the other
hand use a little rubber mallet to give a sharp whack just below the
kneecap. Expected result: the subject’s leg will kick forward, willynilly. This is the automatic reflex that goes by the name “knee-jerk
reaction.” Your quadriceps muscle feels the jolt and signals some
motor neurons, by way of the spinal cord. Your fancy-pants brain
doesn’t enter into it.
Most of us have our patellar reflex tested this way as part of a regular
check-up. To me it always feels a bit uncanny, as if I’m somebody’s
marionette. My knee kicks out and I think, Whoa! Who did that? The
free-will deniers say we’re all somebody’s marionette. The problem
with designing an experiment to prove otherwise is that we’re already
running that experiment, more or less continuously. For example, try
the following: look at your watch, and in fifteen seconds raise your
hand—either your right or your left. I’ll wait…. Did you raise your
hand? Or did you decide not to bother? Either way, you just exercised
free will.
Now, a physical determinist might say that whether or not you raised
your hand was merely a matter of elementary particles moving this
way and that, through your brain and your muscles, obeying the laws
of physics, all part of a grand machine that has been running since the
Big Bang. If my typing these words led, some days later, to your
reading them, followed by your hand going up, there was still an
unbroken chain of particle interactions all along the way. If the
universe keeps surprising us, the determinist says it’s because we
haven’t done the math.

James Gleick, interviewed by Daniel Drake | The New York Review of Books

You may have noticed a flaw in my so-called “experiment”: the only
person who knows for sure that you freely chose whether to raise your
hand is you, looking inward, examining your own thoughts. An
observer has to take your word for it. Scientists rightly mistrust
evidence from introspection. When we look into our own minds, the
view is notoriously cloudy. For that matter, an AI-powered robot could
certainly be programmed to raise its hand, or not, on command.
How might we be able to tell if or when an AI device or system has started
striving or planning?
They might tell us themselves, when the time comes.
In our newest issue, Meghan O’Gieblyn writes about William Egginton’s
book The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate
Nature of Reality, and a tendency Egginton calls “metaphysical
overreach”: “the problems and paradoxes that emerge when we try to
extend our ordinary way of seeing the world beyond the human scale.”
There are a number of interesting convergences between your essay and
O’Gieblyn’s—in particular time, as the thrust of her essay concerns
continuity and discontinuity of knowledge and the self over time. Could
you expand a little on the comments you make in your essay about how
free will and time are linked?
Long before physicists started telling us that free will was an illusion,
theologians wondered how our feeling of freedom could be reconciled
with divine foreknowledge. Augustine addressed God this way: “In the
sublimity of an eternity which is always in the present, you are before
all things past and transcend all things future, because they are still to
come.” A God outside of time, omniscient, seeing past and present in a
tapestry already woven, doesn’t leave us much room for choice.
We mortals can aspire to that godlike perspective—“that purely
transcendent, objective vantage outside the totality of things,” as
O’Gieblyn puts it—but she eloquently reminds us that we can’t have it.
We live in time, and when we forget that, we fall into metaphysical
traps. “Problems and paradoxes” indeed. “Weird things happen,” she
says, “when humans try to cast off the shackles of linear time and
assume the vantage of eternity.” That’s what certain physicists do
when they imagine the universe as a four-dimensional space-time
continuum, in which past and future are interchangeable. They replace
the all-seeing God with the laws of physics, eternal and immutable.
I read O’Gieblyn’s essay as a welcome plea for humility. She quotes
Heisenberg: “We have to remember that what we observe is not nature
in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” We can
construct powerful mathematical models and use them to great effect,
but the models are not the universe (as Borges loved reminding us).
Her paraphrase of the sixth-century philosopher Boethius strikes me
as particularly apt: “We are free because any knowledge that exists

outside of time is irrelevant to the very nature of choice, which must
necessarily take place in time.” As long as the future is still to come,
our choices might matter.
In the last five years alone, you’ve written for us about the moon,
conspiracies and misinformation, Stephen Hawking, clocks, Buckminster
Fuller, invisibility, and, now, free will. How do you choose—or will, as it
were—what subjects to write about?
That sounds like quite a hodgepodge, when you list them that way. My
books have also been fairly wide-ranging, but I’m aware of certain
themes connecting them. Vaguely aware, anyway. I don’t think I’m a
reliable analyst (see above re: introspection). Clearly, I’m drawn to
frontiers of science, though I’m no scientist myself. I’m a sucker for
technology, and I mistrust it. I have a liking for paradox and for
unexpected connections between things.

Just How Free is Free Will? | Smithsonian

Turns out that the more scientists learn about how our brain functions, the less
they think we’re as much in control of our behavior as we’d like to believe. Our
genetic wiring apparently is a very powerful thing, so powerful that it starts to calls
into question just how much we really do control our destiny. Who doesn’t want to
believe that if you really needed to, you could change the way you act or think, that
ultimately you’re the one running the show inside your skull, not millions of
nondescript neurons? But are you really? And if so, how much of it?
This is sobering stuff, although it does give you an out if you’ve already
surrendered to the siren song of chocolate cheesecake. That was, after all, out of
your control, right?
Alfred Mele wouldn’t be so quick to give you a pass. He’s believes in at least some
level of free will and has been researching and writing about these kind of
things for many years. In 2010 he was awarded a $4.4 million foundation grant to
head a four-year project called “Big Questions in Free Will.” Big questions indeed,
from “Is there any scientific evidence that human beings sometimes make free
decisions?” to “Is there any scientific evidence that our subjective sense of free
choice is an illusion?” and a lot of ground in between.
These questions have been bending our minds for thousands of years. But only
recently has technology allowed scientists to track brain activity during the
decision-making process. And that has raised some profound possibilities. One
study in particular, by neuroscientist John-Dylan Haynes concluded that people
seemed to become conscious of making a decision only after their neurons had
already fired into action. Haynes asked people to hit a button randomly with their
right or left hand and, based on what he observed in their brain scans, was able to
predict their decisions seven seconds before they realized they were making them.
Or as Haynes put it, “By the time consciousness kicks in, most of the work has
already been done.”
Not so fast, says Alfred Mele. There’s a big difference between hitting a button in a
lab and say, deciding to move cross-country to start a career or a

relationship. Only when scientists can see how brains behave during those kind of
complex, life-changing decisions, will they be able to draw any meaningful
conclusions about how much free will shapes our lives.
What makes Mele’s project particularly innovative is that it’s taking on free will
from three different directions, mixing neuroscientists with philosophers and
theological scholars. The idea is to merge modern science and ancient wisdom,
and through those diverse perspectives bring us closer to figuring out if we’re in
the driver’s seat or if consciousness is simply your brain’s way of tricking you into
thinking you have control.
Don’t blame me
Of course, there’s risk that comes with this. If the researchers were to conclude
that free will is largely an illusion and behavior is predetermined by a combination
of our genes and our environment, well, that opens up one Costco-size can of
worms.
Other research suggests that if people believe they have little control–and
ultimately little responsibility–for what happens in their lives, they slide to the
dark side. One study found that we’re more willing to cheat, another that
we’re more likely to become slackers at work. Still another, that we become less
generous.
This was enough to have the researchers for the “cheater” study, Kathleen Vohs
and Jonathan Schooler, conclude: “If exposure to deterministic messages increases
the likelihood of unethical actions, then identifying approaches for insulating the
public against this danger becomes imperative.”
In other words, if free will does turn out to be an illusion, maybe it’s better if we
didn’t know.
Who’s in charge here?

When the genes fit: A study by scientists at the University of Oxford
concluded that genetics, not environment, plays a major role in how primates
behave in groups.
Now stop blaming your mother: Yes, there is a “fat gene” that makes it
more likely you’ll be overweight, but no, it’s not a one-way ticket to
Fatsville. New research suggests that the effect of the gene is relatively small
and exercise and a healthy diet can more than compensate for it.
So why doesn’t Queen Latifah have her own country?: Another
study examines how much a person’s name influences their career choice. It
cites, for instance, the “disproportionate” number of dentists named Dennis
or Denise. Who knew?
Ugly truth: Researchers in Belgium say prejudice is a deep psychological
need for people who aren’t comfortable with ambiguity and feel compelled to
make quick, firm decisions about others. And, they argue, it’s virtually
impossible to change this basic way that people think. Now there’s a ray of
sunshine.

Letter: Another nail in the coffin of free will
Published 9 June 2021
From Adrian Bowyer, Foxham, Wiltshire, UK
A number of people quoted in the article on the hypothesis of quantum
superdeterminism criticise it by saying it would make free will untenable (15 May, p 36

🔗 /article/mg25033340-700-is-everything-predetermined-why-physicists-arereviving-a-taboo-idea/).
Setting aside that this criticism confuses the desirable with the real, free will doesn’t
need determinism (quantum or otherwise) to make it untenable. All it needs is logic.
Every event must be caused by one or more preceding events, be spontaneous or result
from both. The two categories – caused and spontaneous – are disjoint, complemental
and together universal; there can be no other sort of event instigator.
Thought is a parallel and sequential collection of events. If they are all caused, then
there is no free will. If some are spontaneous, then there is still no free will: a
spontaneous event is, by definition, not willed.

Letter: Free to question the very idea of free will
Published 26 May 2021
From Nigel Tuersley, Wardour, Wiltshire, UK
You looked at superdeterminism, a take on quantum theory that does away with
randomness (15 May, p 36

🔗 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033340-

700-is-everything-predetermined-why-physicists-are-reviving-a-taboo-idea/).
Objections were raised to it on the grounds that it would deny humans free will.
As far as we are aware, nothing in the universe is independent of the cosmos, and
what we refer to as free will is, in fact, no more or less than the sum of our prior
genetic and environmental influences.
More fundamentally, by what convoluted logic can it be argued that an element of
randomness at the quantum level renders the case for independent thought more
compelling? A so-called free will rooted in random processes is no more independent
than if it is determined by non-random factors.

Letter: Free will | New Scientist

Letter: Free will
Published 7 February 2007
From Andrew Briggs
John Searle takes us on a fascinating and cogent logical journey around the terrain of
free will (13 January, p 48). But I baulked at the assertion that “at the quantum level,
the absence of causally sufficient conditions produces randomness”.
Surely it would be more accurate to say that the absence of any determining factor
allows the continued co-existence of all possible outcomes? Is our notion of “free
will”, then, a manifestation of the pre-observed quantum state – perhaps “collapsing”
into a decision? Might “fate”, where we may perceive or suspect it, be a phenomenon
of entanglement?
From Bjarne Hellemann
So John Searle has chosen to spread a little confusion regarding the much cherished
notion of “free will”. The “problems” of consciousness, and of free will as well as
many others, are merely pseudo-problems demonstrating that dear old dualism is still
with us.
When I choose one thing rather than another, there may be many reasons, some of
which I am conscious of – and others which I don’t know about and, properly, don’t
care about. If you like you can say that all these determine my choice and so, in an
absolute sense, there is no “free” will. But who holds the curious idea that there could
be any phenomenon in the universe that is totally independent of the rest of the
universe? It’s the old “problem” of mind versus body, or soul versus material world.
René Descartes thought that there must be an organ in the brain where two worlds
could somehow connect. Our current knowledge tells us that there are no such things
as separate subjective and objective worlds: there are no signs of superior beings
residing above the profane material world.
If I “drink my mead with a will”, to paraphrase an Icelandic saga, it is sufficient that
there is a will, be it more or less free. The philosophical confusion arises because
“free” is defined as unbounded, limitless freedom from causal and material
phenomena, corresponding to the belief that consciousness, mind or soul are
phenomena or entities separated from matter – and incidentally facilitates belief in
purely spiritual beings.

Letter: Free will | New Scientist

Århus, Denmark
From John Brew
As John Searle suggests, there doesn’t seem to be much room for free will in the usual
scientific paradigms. But is it possible to state what assumptions need to be relaxed in
order for free will to appear?
Would some knowledge of the future, allowing a circular causal loop, be sufficient? If
so, would a control theory or feedback-loop formulation with negative time lag
produce free will? Would a conscious mind and a model of the future be sufficient?
And what, in that case, would be the minimal properties that characterise a “conscious
mind”?

Letter: Is complexity a clue to our place in the

Published 15 April 2020
From Malcolm Shute, La Tour d'Aigues, France
Richard Webb says that free will is “often seen as the opposite of determinism” (15
February, p 34

🔗 /article/mg24532690-700-your-decision-making-ability-is-a-

superpower-physics-cant-explain/). Surely, though, it is randomness that is the true
opposite of determinism.
It seems to me that free will is balanced on the knife-edge boundary between these
states, in a way that is analogous to liquid existing on the line between gaseous and
crystalline states.
Many articles in New Scientist have commented on the special nature of this boundary
between stasis and randomness, and the interesting and counter-intuitive chaotic
behaviour that it leads to.
I see quantum mechanics, too, as positioned on the boundary of self-organised
criticality between classical physical behaviour and weird interconnectedness (26

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

Just deserts
Can we be held morally responsible for our
actions? Yes, says Daniel Dennett. No, says Gregg
Caruso. Reader, you decide
by Daniel C Dennett & Gregg D Caruso

Daniel C Dennett (1942-2024) was the Austin B Fletcher professor of philosophy and
co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University in Massachusetts.
He wrote more than a dozen books, including From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The
Evolution of Minds (2017).
Gregg D Caruso is professor of philosophy at SUNY Corning in New York, honorary
professor of philosophy at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and visiting
researcher at the University of Aberdeen School of Law in Scotland. His latest book
is Unjust Deserts: Free Will, Punishment, and Criminal Justice (forthcoming).

Edited by Nigel Warburton

C aruso: [Dan,] you have famously argued that freedom
evolves and that humans, alone among the animals, have
evolved minds that give us free will and moral responsibility. I,
on the other hand, have argued that what we do and the way
we are is ultimately the result of factors beyond our control,
and that because of this we are never morally responsible for
our actions, in a particular but pervasive sense – the sense
that would make us truly deserving of blame and praise,
punishment and reward. While these two views appear to be
at odds with each other, one of the things I would like to
explore in this conversation is how far apart we actually are. I
suspect that we may have more in common than some think –
but I could be wrong. To begin, can you explain what you
mean by ‘free will’ and why you think humans alone have it?

Dennett: A key word in understanding our differences is
‘control’. [Gregg,] you say ‘the way we are is ultimately the
result of factors beyond our control’ and that is true of only
those unfortunates who have not been able to become
autonomous agents during their childhood upbringing. There
really are people, with mental disabilities, who are not able to
control themselves, but normal people can manage under all
but the most extreme circumstances, and this difference is
both morally important and obvious, once you divorce the
idea of control from the idea of causation. Your past does not
control you; for it to control you, it would have to be able to
monitor feedback about your behaviour and adjust its
interventions – which is nonsense.

In fact, if your past is roughly normal, it contains the causal
chains that turned you into an autonomous, self-controlling
agent. Lucky you. You weren’t responsible for becoming an
autonomous agent, but since you are one, it is entirely
appropriate for the rest of us to hold you responsible for your
deeds under all but the most dire circumstances. As [the
American country singer] Ricky Skaggs once put it: ‘I can’t
control the wind, but I can adjust the sails.’ To suppose that
some further condition should be met in order for you or
anyone else to be ‘truly deserving’ is to ignore or deny the
manifest difference in abilities for self-control that we can
observe and measure readily. In other words, the rationale or
justification for excusing someone, holding them not
deserving of criticism or punishment, is their deficit in this
competence. We don’t try to reason with bears or babies or
lunatics because they aren’t able to respond appropriately.
Why do we reason with people? Why do we try to convince
them of conclusions about free will or science or causation or
anything else? Because we think – for good reason – that in
general people are reasonable, are moved by reasons, can
adjust their behaviour and goals in the light of reasons
presented to them. There is something indirectly self-refuting
in arguing that people are not moved by reasons! And that is
the key to the kind of self-control which we are justified in
treating as our threshold for true desert.

Caruso: I don’t disagree with you that there are important
differences between agents who have the kind of rational
control you highlight and those who lack it. Such a distinction
is undeniable. A normal adult who is responsive to reasons
differs in significant ways from one who is suffering from
psychopathy, Alzheimer’s or severe mental illness. I have no
issue, then, with acknowledging various degrees of ‘control’ or
‘autonomy’ – in fact, I think you and other compatibilists have
done a great job highlighting these differences. My
disagreement has more to do with the conditions required for
what I call ‘basic desert’ moral responsibility. As a free-will
skeptic, I maintain that the kind of control and reasonsresponsiveness you point to, though important, is not enough
to ground basic-desert moral responsibility – the kind of
responsibility that would make us truly deserving of blame
and praise, punishment and reward in a purely backwardlooking sense.

Consider, for example, the various justifications one could
give for punishing wrongdoers. One justification, the one that
dominates our legal system, is to say that they deserve it. This
retributive justification for punishment maintains that
punishment of a wrongdoer is justified for the reason that
he/she deserves something bad to happen to them just
because they have knowingly done wrong. Such a justification
is purely backward-looking. For the retributivist, it is the basic
desert attached to the criminal’s immoral action alone that
provides the justification for punishment. This means that the
retributivist position is not reducible to consequentialist
considerations that try to maximise good outcomes in the
future, nor in justifying punishment does it appeal to wider
goods such as the safety of society or the moral improvement
of those being punished. I contend that retributive
punishment is never justified since agents lack the kind of free
will and basic-desert moral responsibility needed to ground it.

While we may be sensitive to reasons, and this may give us the
kind of voluntary control you mention, the particular reasons
that move us, along with the psychological predispositions,

likes and dislikes, and other constitutive factors that make us
who we are, themselves are ultimately the result of factors
beyond our control. And this remains true whether those
factors include determinism, indeterminism, chance, or luck.
This is not to say that there are not other conceptions of
responsibility that can be reconciled with determinism,
chance or luck. Nor is it to deny that there may be good
forward-looking reasons for maintaining certain systems of
punishment and reward. For instance, free-will skeptics
typically point out that the impositions of sanctions serve
purposes other than punishment of the guilty: it can also be
justified by its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating and
deterring offenders. My question, then, is whether the kind of
desert you have in mind is enough to justify retributive
punishment? If not, then it becomes harder to understand
what, if anything, our disagreement truly amounts to since
forward-looking justifications of punishment are perfectly
consistent with the denial of free will and basic-desert moral
responsibility. And if you are willing to reject retributivism, as
I think you might be, then I’m curious to know exactly what
you mean by ‘desert’ – since it’s debatable whether talk of
giving agents their just deserts makes any sense devoid of its
backward-looking, retributive connotations.

D ennett: You grant that the distinction I make between
people who are autonomous and those who are not (because
of various limits on their abilities to control themselves) is
important, but then say that it is not enough for ‘the kind of
desert’ that would ‘justify retributive punishment’. I too reject
retributivism. It’s a hopeless muddle, and so is any doctrine of
free will that aspires to justify it. But that doesn’t mean there
is no ‘backward-looking’ justification of punishment.

It’s quite straightforward. On Monday you make me a
promise, which I accept in good faith, and rely on when I
adjust my own activities. On Friday, I discover you have
broken your promise, with no excuse (what counts as an
excuse has been well-explored, so I will take that on without
further notice). I blame you for this. My blaming you is of
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

4/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

course backward-looking: ‘But you promised me!’ Autonomous
people are justly held responsible for what they did because all
of us depend on being able to count on them. It is for this
reason that among their responsibilities is preserving their
status as autonomous agents, guarding against the usurpation
or manipulation of their own powers of discernment and
decision. So we can blame them for being duped, for getting
drunk, etc. When we blame them, we are not just diagnosing
them, or categorising them; we are holding them deserving of
negative consequences. If this isn’t ‘basic desert’ then so
much the worse for basic desert. What is it supposed to add to
this kind of desert?

The fact is – and I invite you to consider whether it is a fact –
that autonomous people understand that they will be held to
account and have tacitly accepted this as a condition for their
maintaining their freedom in the political sense. I take this to
be all the grounds we need for justifying the imposition of
negative consequences (under all the usual conditions). The
difference between the madman who is physically restrained
and removed to quarantine for the sake of public safety, and
the deserving culprit who is similarly restrained and then
punished, is large, and it is a key feature of any defensible
system of government. The culprit has the kind of desert that
warrants punishment (but not ‘retributive’ punishment,
whatever that is).

As I have argued before, we can see this rationale in a simpler
domain of human activity: sport. The penalty kicks and red
cards of soccer, the penalty box of ice hockey, the ejection of
players for flagrant fouls, etc, all make sense; the games they
enable would not survive without them. The punishment
(consider the etymology of ‘penalty’) is relatively mild because
‘it’s only a game’, but if the transgression is serious enough,
large fines can be assessed, or banishment from the game,
and, of course, criminal prosecution for assault or cheating
also lurks in the wings. Free-will skeptics should consider if
they would abolish all these rules because the players don’t
have real free will. And if they would grant a special

exemption for such penalties in sport, what principle would
they cite for not extending the same policies to the much
more important game of life?

You also say ‘the particular reasons that move us, along with
the psychological predispositions, likes and dislikes, and other
constitutive factors that make us who we are, themselves are
ultimately the result of factors beyond our control’. So what?
The point I think you are missing is that autonomy is
something one grows into, and this is indeed a process that is
initially entirely beyond one’s control, but as one matures, and
learns, one begins to be able to control more and more of
one’s activities, choices, thoughts, attitudes, etc. Yes, a great
deal of luck is involved, but then a great deal of luck is
involved in just being born, in being alive. We human beings
are well designed to take advantage of the luck we encounter,
and to overcome or deflect or undo the bad luck we
encounter, to the point where we are held responsible for not
taking foolish chances (for instance) that might lead to our
losing control. There is no incompatibility between
determinism and self-control.

C aruso: Well, I’m glad to know that you reject retributivism
along with ‘any doctrine of free will that aspires to justify it’.
This point of agreement is significant since it entails that
major elements of the criminal justice system are unjustified.
I’m curious to know, however, what exactly you would replace
retributive legal punishment with, and to what extent you
reject the status quo. I ask because, though you claim to reject
retributivism, you go on to defend a backward-looking
conception of blame and punishment grounded in the idea
that offenders are ‘deserving of negative consequences’. Isn’t
this just retributivism by another name?

Retributivism is the view that we ought to punish offenders
because they deserve to be punished. Punishment is justified,
for the retributivist, solely by the fact that those receiving it
deserve it. And while punishment may deter future crime,
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

6/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

incapacitate dangerous criminals, educate citizens, and the
like, for a retributivist these are a happy surplus that
punishment produces, and form no part of what makes
punishment just – ie, we are justified in punishing deserving
offenders even if the punishment produces none of these
other surplus good effects. How does your view differ from
this? Do you think the forward-looking benefits of
punishment are what justified it? If so, then what role does
desert play? If not, aren’t we left with the retributivist claim
that backward-looking desert is sufficient to justify blame and
punishment?

As for your sports example, I don’t see why this would be a
problem for free-will skeptics. There are good instrumentalist
and forward-looking reasons for maintaining penalties even if
we reject free will and basic-desert moral responsibility. First
and foremost, penalties deter players from breaking the rules.
This keeps the game fair, prevents injuries, and serves all
kinds of non-punitive purposes. The 24-second clock in
basketball, for instance, was introduced to make the game
more exciting. Without it, the game was dull, all too often
played at a snail’s pace with one team opening up a lead and
freezing the ball until time ran out. The only thing the trailing
team could do was foul, thus games became rough, ragged,
boring free-throw contests. Penalties for unnecessarily
aggressive physical play, on the other hand, protect players,
reduce injuries, and deter future bad behaviour. All of this can
be explained without appeal to free will and just deserts.

Lastly, you say that ‘autonomy is something one grows into,
and this is indeed a process that is initially entirely beyond
one’s control, but as one matures, and learns, one begins to be
able to control more and more of one’s activities, choices,
thoughts, attitudes, etc’. You acknowledge that ‘a great deal of
luck is involved’ in this, but I would go further and argue that
‘luck swallows everything’ (to borrow a phrase from [the
British analytic philosopher] Galen Strawson). Consider the
significant role luck plays in our lives. First, there is the initial
‘lottery of life’ or ‘luck of the draw’, over which we have no say.

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

Whether we are born into poverty or affluence, war or peace,
abusive or loving homes, is simply a matter of luck. It is also a
matter of luck what natural gifts, talents, predispositions, and
physical traits we are born with. Beyond this initial lottery of
life, there is also the luck of what breaks one encounters
during one’s period of self-formation, and what environmental
influences are most salient to us.

Combined, these matters of luck determine what Thomas
Nagel famously calls constitutive luck – luck in who one is and
what character traits and dispositions one has. Since our
genes, parents, peers and other environmental influences all
contribute to making us who we are, and since we have no
control over these, it seems that who we are is at least largely a
matter of luck. And since how we act is partly a function of
who we are, the existence of constitutive luck entails that what
actions we perform depends on luck.

In Elbow Room (1984), your first book on free will, you
acknowledge all this, but then go on to say that luck in initial
conditions need not ‘lead to something hideously unfair’. You
proceed to give the example of a footrace where some are
given a head start based on when they were born (an arbitrary
fact). You argue that this would be unfair if the race were a
100-yard dash but not if it’s a marathon. ‘In a marathon,’ you
write, ‘such a relatively small initial advantage would count for
nothing, since one can reliably expect other fortuitous breaks
to have even greater effects.’ You conclude: ‘A good runner
who starts at the back of the pack, if he is really good enough
to deserve winning, will probably have plenty of opportunity
to overcome the initial disadvantage.’ On your analogy, then,
since life is more like a marathon than a sprint, ‘luck averages
out in the long run’.

While this example has folksy appeal, it is demonstrably false.
Luck does not average out in the long run. Those who start
from a disadvantaged position of genetic abilities or early
environment do not always have offsetting luck later in life.

The data clearly shows that early inequalities in life often
compound over time rather than average out, affecting
everything from differences in health and incarceration rates
to success in school and all other aspects of life. To use
another sports example, in his book Outliers (2008), [the
Canadian journalist] Malcolm Gladwell documents the rather
strange fact that there are more players in the National
Hockey League born in January, February and March than
any other months. His explanation is that in Canada, where
children start playing hockey at a very young age, the
eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey programmes is January
1. At the ages of six and seven, being 10 or 11 months older
gives one a distinct advantage over one’s competitors. Since
the older players tend to do better, they end up getting more
playing time, and as they progress through the ranks they are
selected for better teams and more elite programmes, receive
better coaching, and play more games against better
competition. What begins as a small advantage, a mere matter
of luck, snowballs and leads to an ever-widening gap of
achievement and success.

This kind of phenomenon can be found throughout society.
Studies show, for instance, that low socioeconomic status in
childhood can affect everything from brain development to
life expectancy, education, incarceration rates and income.
The same is true for educational inequity, exposure to
violence, and nutritional disparities. It’s a mistake, then, to
think that luck averages out in the long run – it does not.

In addition to constitutive luck, there is also present luck – luck
at or around the moment of a putatively free and morally
responsible action or decision. Present luck can include an
agent’s mood, what reasons happen to come to her,
situational features of the environment, how aware she is of
the morally significant features of her surroundings, and the
like. It is a matter of present luck, for instance, whether our
attention wanders at just the right/wrong moment or whether
chance features of the environment prime our deliberation. I
contend, following my friend [the British neuroethicist] Neil
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

Levy, that the one-two punch of constitutive luck (luck that
causes relevant properties of agents, such as their beliefs,
desires and predispositions) and present luck completely
undermine basic-desert moral responsibility.

The problem with constitutive luck is that an agent’s
endowments (ie, traits and dispositions) result from factors
beyond the agent’s control. Now, I’m sure you will say that as
long as an agent takes responsibility for her endowments,
dispositions and values, over time she will become morally
responsible for them (and perhaps even gain some control
over them). The problem with this reply, however, is that the
series of actions through which agents shape and modify their
endowments, dispositions and values are themselves
significantly subject to luck – and, as Levy puts it: ‘We cannot
undo the effects of luck with more luck’. Hence the very
actions to which compatibilists point, the actions whereby
agents take responsibility for their endowments, either express
that endowment (when they are explained by constitutive
luck) or reflect the agent’s present luck, or both. Either way,
responsibility is undermined.

D ennett: The sense of ‘deserve’ that I defend is the everyday
sense in which, when you win the race fair and square, you
deserve the blue ribbon or gold medal; and if you wrote the
novel, you deserve the royalties, and if you plagiarised it, you
don’t; and if you knowingly parked in a ‘No Parking’ zone,
you deserve a parking ticket; and if you refuse to pay it, you
deserve some escalated penalty; and if you committed
premeditated murder, you deserve to go to prison for a very
long time – provided, in all cases, that you are a responsible
agent, a member in the Moral Agents Club, as I have called it.
Of course it is the ‘forward-looking benefits’ of the whole system
of desert (praise and blame, reward and punishment) that
justifies it, but it justifies the system while ruling out case-bycase consideration of the specific benefits or lack thereof
accruing to any particular instance of blame or punishment –
which is not true of therapy, for instance. The system
specifically prohibits even raising the issue of whether, in this
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

instance, more good than harm would result from
abandoning the verdict and the penalty.

People understand that. They would be incensed by a baseball
umpire who took it upon himself to call strikes balls in order
to bolster the ego of the depressed batter whose dying mother
was watching from the stands, and they would be incensed –
and properly so, I claim – by a judge who set aside damning
evidence because the defendant had suffered enough already.
Jury nullification is, of course, an example of the sort of
bending of the rules which we all understand, and we
understand it should be reserved for very special
circumstances in which the laws, as they are written, fail to
treat defendants fairly. The reason is that upholding the law
and respect for the law is a key ‘forward-looking’ policy. It is
the maintenance of the credibility of the law and support for
its provisions that governs all adjustments and limits all
exemptions, for a straightforward reason: people are not
angels, and will be clever (rational) and self-interested enough
to explore for loopholes and ways of gaming the system. That
is why the burden of proof of moral incompetence must rest
on the defendant.

So is the concept I am defending any kind of desert? It is not
‘basic desert’ – a chimera fantasised by philosophers,
apparently. Praise (or royalties, or your paycheck) is not just
encouragement or reinforcement, and blame (or fines or
incarceration) is not just deterrence or therapy. You are
entitled to the praise you get for your good deeds and to the
paycheck you get for your doing your job; and the criticism,
the shame, the blame you get if you offend common decency
or violate the laws is quite justly and properly placed at your
doorstep. That is not ‘retributive’ punishment, I guess, but it
hurts, and so it should.

You think my parallel with rules in sports ‘can all be explained
without appeal to free will and just deserts’. I disagree. The
rules of sports have exclusionary clauses for events outside
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

11/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

the control of the players, and also rules obliging players to
maintain self-control. (There are cases where a player gets
excused if he ‘could not have done otherwise’, and cases
where this is no excuse, in exact parallel to the moral cases.
No player has ever raised the issue of being exempt from
blame because of the truth of determinism!) Players must be
capable of understanding the rules, and agreeing to play by
them, so they are considered to be autonomous, reasoning
agents. Rules are composed to make games fair, and as [the
American political philosopher] John Rawls noted long ago,
justice is a kind of fairness.

You claim that adopting my non-retributive defence of
punishment would require that ‘major elements of the
criminal justice system’ would need to be abandoned. I don’t
see it. What would be jeopardised? I myself have urged all
along that we need major reform of our penal policies,
drastically reducing sentences, eliminating the death penalty,
and instituting many programmes to help prisoners prepare
for the resumption of their full rights of citizenship, but it
would still be a system of punishment, not just enforced
rehabilitation processes or quarantine. If a magic pill were
invented that would turn any convict into a safe honest
citizen, it would not obviate the need for punishment, for
instance.

Strawson may have said that ‘luck swallows everything’ but, if
so, he was wrong. Luck sets the stage, but even you note that
– according to Nagel – ‘who we are is at least largely a matter
of luck’. Largely, not all. Yes, what actions we perform depend
(trivially) on luck, but not entirely on luck. Skill comes into it
(and, yes, as I discussed in Elbow Room, how good you are at
acquiring skill is itself largely – not entirely – a matter of
luck). (See the discussion in [my 2003 book] Freedom Evolves,
pp276ff, where I deal with the marathon case and your
objection.) When I said that luck averages out in the long run,
I was speaking of those of us who (lucky us) are competent
moral agents. There are manifest differences, of course,
between those of us who barely make the grade and those

who are fortunate enough to find being moral quite easy, all
things considered, and our policies and practices allow for
this by setting a ‘ceiling effect’ (FE, p291). We also take steps
to improve the moral competence of all, with practices that
amount to compensatory ‘special ed’ instruction and therapy.

In effect, you are stuck on the wrong side of a sorites puzzle: if
I am born without moral responsibility, utterly dependent on
the luck of genes and environment, then how can adding a
smidgen of competence ever lead me to be responsible?
When does a pile become a heap? When does a man lose
enough hair to be bald? The gradual accumulation of the
grounds for being held responsible, and holding oneself
responsible, has no natural moment when ‘a bell rings’ and
you acquire free will, but we have devised defensible and
adjustable thresholds that measure what matters. Since the
benefits of political freedom in a well-governed state are so
great, most people aspire to moral competency, and for good
reasons. And when they screw up, they would rather be
punished than institutionalised as morally incompetent.
‘Thanks, I needed that!’

C aruso: I don’t doubt that the sense of ‘desert’ you defend is
the everyday sense. Keep in mind, though, that it is exactly
this sense of desert that is used to justify retributivism. And
nothing you have said suggests that you reject either of the
two main tenets of retributivism – its backward-looking-ness
(at least internal to the moral responsibility system) and its
appeal to just deserts. Quite the opposite, you explicitly state
that the premeditated murderer really does ‘deserve to go to
prison for a very long time’, irrespective of future
consequences in specific instances. I’m confused, then, why
you continue to deny that you are a retributivist. It seems to
me that your view is indistinguishable from retributivism. Yes,
you support sentence reform and eliminating the death
penalty, but that’s doesn’t make you a non-retributivist. But
rather than get into a debate over your membership in the
Retributivist Party, I think it would be more helpful to focus
on specifics.

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

I disagree with you that people deserve to be praised and
blamed in the everyday cases you discuss. Consider the case
of Albert Einstein. He too was a free-will skeptic who believed
that his scientific accomplishments were not of his own
making. In a 1929 interview in The Saturday Evening Post, he
said: ‘I do not believe in free will … I believe with
Schopenhauer: we can do what we wish, but we can only wish
what we must.’ He goes on to add: ‘My own career was
undoubtedly determined, not by my own will but by various
factors over which I have no control.’ He concludes by
rejecting the idea that he deserves praise or credit for his
scientific achievements: ‘I claim credit for nothing. Everything
is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over
which we have no control.’

Side note: my own free-will skepticism is agnostic about
determinism. I maintain that whether or not the Universe is
governed by deterministic laws, Einstein’s general point
remains true, since indeterminate events are no more within
our control than determined ones. This is why, following [the
Dutch-born moral philosopher] Derk Pereboom, I call myself
a hard-incompatibilist rather than a hard-determinist.) Of course
we can attribute various accomplishments to Einstein – freewill skepticism is perfectly consistent with attributability. We
can also say that Einstein was extremely intelligent, gifted and
creative. What we cannot say, if we are free-will skeptics, is
that Einstein deserves praise (in the ‘basic desert’ sense) for his
attributes and accomplishments.

I know this sounds counterintuitive, but that’s only because
internal to the moral responsibility system, desert-based praise
and blame, punishment and reward come naturally. The
problem with appealing to our everyday practices, however, is
that it takes for granted the very thing in need of justification.
To paraphrase my friend and fellow skeptic [the American
ethicist] Bruce Waller, if we start from the assumption of the
moral responsibility system, then the denial of moral
responsibility is absurd and self-defeating. But the universal
denial of moral responsibility does not start from the
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

14/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

assumption that under normal circumstances we are morally
responsible, and it does not proceed from that starting point
to enlarge and extend the range of excuses to cover everyone
(so that everyone is profoundly flawed). That is indeed a path
to absurdity. Rather, those who reject moral responsibility
reject the basic system which starts from the assumption that
all minimally competent persons are morally responsible. For
the free-will skeptic, it is never fair to treat anyone as morally
responsible, no matter how reasonable, competent, selfefficacious, strong-willed and clear-sighted that person may
be. Since skeptics like myself, who globally challenge moral
responsibility, do not accept the rules of that system, it is
question-begging to assume our ordinary moral responsibility
practices are justified without refuting the various arguments
for global skepticism.

Now, in fairness, you do provide a forward-looking
justification for backward-looking blame and punishment.
That is, you argue that the whole moral responsibility system is
justified in terms of its forward-looking benefits, but once we
adopt the ‘system of desert’ we need to reject case-by-case
judgments of what would produce the best outcomes. Internal
to the system, you maintain, we need to adopt backwardlooking, desert-based practices and policies. But I see at least
two problems with this. First, it’s an open question whether
the moral responsibility system has the forward-looking
benefits you maintain. The notion of just deserts, for instance, is
too often used to justify punitive excess in criminal justice, to
encourage treating people in severe and demeaning ways, and
to excuse and perpetuate social and economic inequalities.
Additionally, resentment, indignation, moral anger and blame
are often counterproductive on the interpersonal level when it
comes to the goals of safety, moral formation and
reconciliation.

Rather than argue the point further here, however, I will
simply note that it remains an empirical question whether, on
balance, we would be better off without a system of desert. I
believe we would be. My second concern is that blame and
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

15/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

punishment, especially legal punishment, can cause severe
harm. If you want to justify the harm caused by blame and
punishment on the assumption that agents are free and
morally responsible, hence justly deserve to suffer for the
wrongs they have done, then it would seem you need good
epistemic reasons for thinking agents actually are free and
morally responsible in the sense required. But I don’t see how
a pragmatic or consequentialist justification of the ‘whole
system of desert’ can provide such a justification. Pointing to
the benefits of adopting a system of desert seems orthogonal to
the core question.

Lastly, regarding luck, I go further than Nagel, and maintain
that every morally significant act is either constitutively lucky,
presently lucky, or both. Your antidote to luck seems to be
skill or moral competency. But, as I argued earlier, the series
of actions through which agents develop various skills and
competencies are themselves either the result of constitutive
luck (when they stem from an agent’s endowments), present
luck, or both.

D ennett: You find my view ‘indistinguishable from
retributivism’. This baffles me, since I have all along stressed
the ‘forward-looking’ justification I have presented. There are
non-retributive, non-deontological, consequentialist
justifications of punishment. See, for instance, the excellent
entry on punishment in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
by my late friend and [Tufts University] colleague Hugo
Bedau. The ‘liberal justification’ of punishment he offers there
is one with which I, along with many others, concur. As Bedau
notes, after making proper hash of retributivism: ‘But the
basic insights of retributivism cannot be merely brushed
aside. There is a role for desert in a liberal theory of
punishment, but its scope needs careful restriction.’

A key feature of that careful restriction is an appreciation of its
role in preserving and enhancing respect for the law. You
describe my view as holding that ‘once we adopt the “system
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

16/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

of desert we need to reject case-by-case judgments of what
would produce the best outcomes’. Not quite right; you must
add ‘in the immediate circumstances’. The point is that a
policy of case-by-case judgments of what would produce the
‘best outcome’ considered locally would threaten both the
effective administration of justice (by inviting special pleading
on behalf of either the perpetrator or the injured party or
society as a whole) and respect for the law. That is the point of
my examples of the biased umpire and the judge who
suppresses evidence. Accepting bad outcomes in specific
cases is only justified by the long-run protection of respect for
the law, and whenever evidence mounts for adjustments to
general policies, laws can be revised, a demonstrably better
policy than ‘taking the law into your own hands’.

Bedau usefully lists four requirements for any justification of
punishment:
Accordingly, to justify punishment we must specify, first,
what our goals are in establishing (or perpetuating) the
practice itself. Second, we must show that when we
punish we actually achieve these goals. Third, we must
show that we cannot achieve these goals unless we
punish (and punish in certain ways and not in others)
and that we cannot achieve them with comparable or
superior efficiency and fairness by nonpunitive
interventions. Fourth, we must show that striving to
achieve these goals by way of the imposition of
deprivations is itself justified.
You say ‘it’s an open question whether the moral
responsibility system has the forward-looking benefits you
maintain’ (Bedau’s point two) and ‘it remains an empirical
question whether, on balance, we would be better off without
a system of desert. I believe we would be’ (Bedau’s point
three). Indeed, these are open empirical questions, but not
very open! I cannot see how you can think we would be better
off without a system of desert – unless you are granting me
my kind of desert and merely saying we’d be better off without

some as yet undescribed sort of ‘basic’ desert (and I am quite
sure we are better off without that). For without my kind of
desert, no one would deserve to receive the prize they
competed for in good faith and won, no one would deserve to
be blamed for breaking solemn promises without excuse, no
one would deserve to have their driver’s licence revoked for
drunk-driving, no one would deserve punishment for lying
under oath, and so forth. There would be no rights, no
recourse to authority to protect against fraud, theft, rape,
murder. In short, no morality.

I was astonished by your sentence: ‘For the free-will skeptic, it
is never fair to treat anyone as morally responsible, no matter
how reasonable, competent, self-efficacious, strong-willed and
clear-sighted that person may be.’ Do you really want to
return humanity to [the 17th-century English philosopher
Thomas] Hobbes’s state of nature where life is nasty, brutish
and short? If you have some other vision of how a stable,
secure and just state can thrive without appeal to moral
responsibility, you owe us the details. Waller, in The Injustice of
Punishment (2018), makes a brave attempt to do that, but
even he concedes that you cannot have such a society without
punishment, as announced by the title of his Chapter 2: ‘The
Unjust Necessity of Punishment’. Well, if punishment is a
necessity, it isn’t a logical or physical necessity; it’s a necessity
for a viable state in which as much justice as practically
possible might be achieved. In what way would such a
necessity be ‘unjust’? In the same way, it seems to me, that it
is ‘unfair’ that everyone can’t be above average – in beauty,
strength, intelligence, whatever. Life is tough, but not ipso
facto unjust, and we can use our reason to make life, and its
institutions, more and more just, more and more fair, a better
world for all.

C aruso: Thank you for clearing some things up for me. You
say that my confusion over whether you reject retributivism
‘baffles’ you, since you ‘have all along stressed the “forwardlooking” justification [you] have presented’. I guess my
confusion stemmed from the fact that earlier in the
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

18/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

conversation you said that rejecting retributivism ‘doesn’t
mean there is no “backward-looking” justification of
punishment’. You then went on to defend what looked to be a
backward-looking justification of blame and punishment
grounded in desert. If, instead, you adopt a forward-looking
consequentialist account of punishment, then I’m happy to
retract my earlier charge that you are a retributivist in all but
name. That said, by adopting a forward-looking
consequentialist justification, your view comes much closer to
that of the skeptic. The main difference, it seems, is that you
want to retain the language of desert while the skeptic wants
to consign it to the flames – along with libertarian free will,
retributivism, and the idea of being self-made men and
women (all of which you reject as well).

You go on to say: ‘I cannot see how you can think we would be
better off without a system of desert.’ Well, for me, the notion
of basic desert, which has been my target all along, is a
pernicious one that does more harm than good. If that is not
the sense of desert you have in mind, then so be it. But my
claim is that basic-desert moral responsibility, and with it the
notion of just deserts, is too often used to justify punitive
excess in criminal justice, to encourage treating people in
severe and demeaning ways, and to excuse and perpetuate
social and economic inequalities. Consider, for example,
punitiveness. Researchers have found that stronger belief in
free will is correlated with increased punitiveness. They also
found that weakening one’s belief in free will makes them less
retributive in their attitudes about punishment (for details,
see here.)

These empirical findings concern me.

There are additional concerns as well. As I argue in my Public
Health and Safety (2017), the social determinants of criminal
behaviour are broadly similar to the social determinants of
health. In that work, and elsewhere, I advocate adopting a
broad public-health approach for identifying and taking
https://aeon.co/essays/on-free-will-daniel-dennett-and-gregg-caruso-go-head-to-head

19/21

23/03/2025, 22:15

On free will: Daniel Dennett and Gregg Caruso go head to head | Aeon Essays

action on these shared social determinants. I focus on how
social inequities and systemic injustices affect health
outcomes and criminal behaviour, how poverty affects brain
development, how offenders often have pre-existing medical
conditions (especially mental-health issues), how
homelessness and education affects health and safety
outcomes, how environmental health is important to both
public health and safety, how involvement in the criminal
justice system itself can lead to or worsen health and cognitive
problems, and how a public-health approach can be
successfully applied within the criminal justice system. I argue
that, just as it is important to identify and take action on the
social determinants of health if we want to improve health
outcomes, it is equally important to identify and address the
social determinants of criminal behaviour. My fear is that the
system of desert you want to preserve leads us to myopically
focus on individual responsibility and ultimately prevents us
from addressing the systemic causes of criminal behaviour.

Consider, for example, the crazed reaction to [the then US
president Barack] Obama’s claim that, ‘if you’ve got a
[successful] business, you didn’t build that’ alone. The
Republicans were so incensed by this claim that they
dedicated the second day of the 2012 Republican National
Convention to the theme ‘We Built it!’ Obama’s point, though,
was simple, innocuous, and factually correct. To quote him
directly: ‘If you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on
your own.’ So, what’s so threatening about this? The answer, I
believe, lies in the notion of just deserts. The system of desert
keeps alive the belief that if you end up in poverty or prison,
this is ‘just’ because you deserve it. Likewise, if you end up
succeeding in life, you and you alone are responsible for that
success. This way of thinking keeps us locked in the system of
blame and shame, and prevents us from addressing the systemic
causes of poverty, wealth-inequality, racism, sexism,
educational inequity and the like. My suggestion is that we
move beyond this, and acknowledge that the lottery of life is
not always fair, that luck does not average out in the long run,

and that who we are and what we do is ultimately the result of
factors beyond our control.

Finally, I do not agree that rejecting free will and basic-desert
moral responsibility will ‘return humanity to Hobbes’s state of
nature where life is nasty, brutish and short’. You write: ‘If you
have some other vision of how a stable, secure and just state
can thrive without appeal to moral responsibility, you owe us
the details.’ First, let me reiterate that the kind of moral
responsibility I reject is basic-desert moral responsibility. Of
course, there are other conceptions of moral responsibility
that are perfectly consistent with free-will skepticism – such
as Waller’s notion of take-charge responsibility, the
attributability responsibility I referenced in the Einstein
example, and Pereboom’s forward-looking notion of
responsibility that focuses on three nondesert-invoking
desiderata: future protection, future reconciliation, and future
moral formation. Second, I agree that I owe you and others an
account of how to maintain a stable, secure and just society
without basic-desert moral responsibility. Fortunately, my
good friend Derk Pereboom has already provided most of the
details for such an account in his two books Living Without
Free Will (2001) and Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life
(2014). And I have further developed a detailed account of
how to address criminal behaviour without basic-desert moral
responsibility – it’s called the public health-quarantine model.
While I wish we could debate the merits of it here, it
unfortunately looks like we have run out of time. The details of
my account, however, are readily available for anyone who is
interested (see here, here, and here).

A CONVERSATION WITH

Robert Sapolsky Doesn’t Believe in
Free Will. (But Feel Free to Disagree.)
Shedding the concept “completely strikes at our sense of identity and autonomy,” the
Stanford biologist and neuroscientist argues. It might also be liberating.
By Hope Reese
Published Oct. 16, 2023 Updated Oct. 18, 2023

There is no free will, according to Robert Sapolsky, a biologist and neuroscientist at
Stanford University and a recipient of the MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. Dr.
Sapolsky worked for decades as a field primatologist before turning to neuroscience, and
he has spent his career investigating behavior across the animal kingdom and writing
about it in books including “Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst” and
“Monkeyluv, and Other Essays on Our Lives as Animals.”
In his latest book, “Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will,” Dr. Sapolsky
confronts and refutes the biological and philosophical arguments for free will. He
contends that we are not free agents, but that biology, hormones, childhood and life
circumstances coalesce to produce actions that we merely feel were ours to choose.
It’s a provocative claim, he concedes, but he would be content if readers simply began to
question the belief, which is embedded in our cultural conversation. Getting rid of free
will “completely strikes at our sense of identity and autonomy and where we get meaning
from,” Dr. Sapolsky said, and this makes the idea particularly hard to shake.
There are major implications, he notes: Absent free will, no one should be held
responsible for their behavior, good or bad. Dr. Sapolsky sees this as “liberating” for most
people, for whom “life has been about being blamed and punished and deprived and
ignored for things they have no control over.”
He spoke in a series of interviews about the challenges that free will presents and how he
stays motivated without it. These conversations were edited and condensed for clarity.
To most people, free will means being in charge of our actions. What’s wrong with that
outlook?
It’s a completely useless definition. When most people think they’re discerning free will,
what they mean is somebody intended to do what they did: Something has just
happened; somebody pulled the trigger. They understood the consequences and knew

that alternative behaviors were available.
But that doesn’t remotely begin to touch it, because you’ve got to ask: Where did that
intent come from? That’s what happened a minute before, in the years before, and
everything in between.
For that sort of free will to exist, it would have to function on a biological level completely
independently of the history of that organism. You would be able to identify the neurons
that caused a particular behavior, and it wouldn’t matter what any other neuron in the
brain was doing, what the environment was, what the person’s hormone levels were,
what culture they were brought up in. Show me that those neurons would do the exact
same thing with all these other things changed, and you’ve proven free will to me.
So, whether I wore a red or blue shirt today — are you saying I didn’t really choose that?
Absolutely. It can play out in the seconds before. Studies show that if you’re sitting in a
room with a terrible smell, people become more socially conservative. Some of that has to
do with genetics: What’s the makeup of their olfactory receptors? With childhood: What
conditioning did they have to particular smells? All of that affects the outcome.
What about something bigger, like choosing where to go to college?
You ask, “Why did you pick this one?” And the person says, “I’ve learned that I do better
in smaller classes.” Or, “They have an amazing party scene.” At any meaningful juncture,
we’re making decisions based on our tastes and predilections and values and character.
And you have to ask: Where did they come from?
Neuroscience is getting really good at two levels of stuff. One is understanding what a
particular part of the brain does, based on techniques like neuroimaging and transcranial
magnetic stimulation.
The other is at the level of tiny, reductive stuff: This variant of this gene interacts with
this enzyme differently. So, we kind of understand what happens in one neuron. But how
do 30 billion of them collectively make this a human cortex instead of a primate cortex?
How do you scale up from understanding little component parts and getting some sense
of the big, emergent thing?
Say we figured that out. Have X happen 4,000 times per second in Y part of the brain,
countered — as an opposing, inhibitory thing — 2,123 times a second when the hormone
levels are doing such-and-such. How does this big thing called a “behavior” or a
“personality” or a “thought” or a “mistake” pop out at the macro level? We’re beginning
to understand how you get from one level to the other, but it’s unbelievably difficult.
If we’re not responsible for our actions, can we take ownership of them?

Robert Sapolsky Doesn’t Believe in Free Will. (But Feel Free to Disagree.) - The New York Times

Well, we can take ownership in a purely mechanical sense. My molecules knocked into
the molecules making up that vase of flowers and knocked it over and broke it — that’s
true. And we can keep ourselves going with myths of agency when it really doesn’t make
a difference. If you want to believe that you freely chose to floss your upper teeth before
your bottom teeth today, that’s a benign myth to operate with.
But you’re saying that the myth isn’t always benign?
Fundamentally injurious things about our universe run on the notion that people get stuff
that they didn’t earn or they didn’t deserve, and a huge amount of humanity’s misery is
due to myths of free will.
Most of the time, I get by without having to pay any attention whatsoever to how I think
things work. Recognize how hard it is to do otherwise. Save that recognition for when it
matters: when you’re on a jury; when you’re a schoolteacher, assessing students. If you
have myths about free will, keep it to how you’re flossing your teeth.
I want to wean people off the knee-jerk reaction to the notion that without free will, we
will run amok because we can’t be held responsible for things. That we have no societal
mechanisms for having dangerous people not be dangerous, or for having gifted people
do the things society needs to function. It’s not the case that in a deterministic world,
nothing can change.
How should privileged people think about their accomplishments?
Every living organism is just a biological machine. But we’re the only ones that know that
we’re biological machines; we are trying to make sense of the fact that we feel as if our
feelings are real.
At some point, it doesn’t make a difference whether your feelings are real or whether
your feeling of feelings being real is the case. We still find things aversive enough as
biological machines that it’s useful to call stuff like that “pain” or “sadness” or
“unhappiness.” And even though it’s completely absurd to think that something good can
happen to a machine, it’s good when the feeling of feeling pain is lessened.
That’s a level on which we have to function. Meaning feels real. Purpose feels real. Every
now and then, our knowledge of the machine-ness should not get in the way of the fact
that this is a weird machine that feels as if feelings are real.
Do we lose love, too, if we lose free will?
Yeah. Like: “Wow! Why? Why did this person turn out to love me? Where did that come
from? And how much of that has to do with how my parents raised me, or what sort of
olfactory receptor genes I have in my nose and how much I like their scent?” At some
point you get to that existential crisis of, “Oh God, that’s what’s underlying all this stuff!”
That’s where the machine-ness becomes something we should be willing to ignore.

A social universe is an extraordinarily complex thing. At its own level, a mind-brain is equally
complex. When a mind is behaving within in a group, patterns emerge – patterns that the mind can
hardly grasp. These complex forms are self-organising, and emerge on their own and for adaptive
purposes. They are perfectly fitted to the context in which they are born and each is unique. There is a
particular feeling of being part of the pattern, just as there is a particular feeling of being excluded
from the whole. Consider this scene.

Social determinism starts at school

Extrait COMME UN LOUP - la scène du vélo

Scene from Comme un Loup (“Like a Wolf”).

A group of kids taking turns on a bicycle in the midst of a playground. Never have they been told to do
this, nor when, how or with whom. They just know when the time is right, and it feels great.
Contemplate these children and their organisation, feel the implicit laws of their social universe. They
are learning as a group. The scene is taken from the film Comme un Loup (“Like a Wolf” in English),
which provides a new take on the place of school in the world of youth, and the place of youth in the
world of school.
Comme un Loup is a documentary about school and its psychological and behavioural consequences.
The film asks several important questions, which cannot be answered through traditional testing
methods. To what degree can school be said to occupy the living world of young people? And do young
people genuinely exist as individuals in the midst of educational planning? To put it another way, to
what degree do pupils belong to or in school?

Social determinism starts at school

Comme Un Loup (“Like a Wolf”, 2017) is a documentary film exploring social determinism at school.

Pupils would be the first to agree that centring on the pupil is not what our current school system
does. In fact, the needs and wishes of pupils are increasingly being pushed further into the
background in the administrative striving toward higher ‘standards’ and a broader range of skills and
competences. Behind this lies an unassailable narrative whose moral is unequivocal: success at school
is the key to prosperity in life. What are the consequences here? What the costs for pupils and,
ultimately, for our societies?
The purpose of school is to create the human resources necessary to sustain culture in the future –
and, incidentally, to fund the old age of those currently deciding the fate of children. But if we choose
to see school from the point of view of the children themselves, as human beings growing, building the
forces necessary to launch themselves on their trajectory of life, creating their identity and learning to
share spheres of belonging, then school becomes something quite different. It ceases to be a factory
producing workers for the future and becomes a period of time, a realm of possibilities, a playground,
an arena for life, a stable ground where ideas and talents can grow.

School as a sphere of opportunities
Children do not go to school to be transformed into some kind of resource bank, they go to school to
grow, to enjoy, to interact, to experiment and to learn about the mysteries of life. They go to school to
discover what is not already known, the vastness both of self and of world. We chose not to show any
school in the film, since, as far as young people are concerned, they simply seem a world apart – a
sphere in which only the few belong.

Social determinism starts at school

School teaches us to be proud or ashamed, that we are a success or a failure – and that knowledge
never leaves us. To know that you are a failure is to know you do not belong in the society that brands
you so. When schools send failures into the world, they are surely creating not resources but problems
for the future. The three characters of this film all frequented the same middle school before their
trajectories diverged. Whether through boxing or politics, each has found a sphere of belonging
outside of the schooling system; all except the main character of the film, Yaya who happens to be a
success at school.

Scene from Comme un Loup.

Yaya is torn between worlds, between school and family, family and friends, friends from the
neighbourhood and friends from school. The tragic hero in the play of meritocracy, Yaya is the
individual success hiding a collective failure. Its many spheres of belonging conflict under the
authority of ever more precise evaluations, which permeates all aspects of the boy’s life. When
discussing lovers, the first thing Yaya and his friends do is rate them on scale of one to ten. Their lives
are predicated and determined on the values and thought processes they have learned through school.
Yaya is one of the only kids in his marginalised neighbourhood in Paris to pursue higher studies. Poster

Social determinism starts at school

In an increasingly globalised, transient and confusing world, many children – especially those who
have been displaced – are seeking to find their identity in a sphere of belonging – in the circles of
family, friendship, neighbourhood and school. How can harmony be achieved among spheres of
belonging? Among the thousands of virtual relations and fragile and fluid affiliations, is there still
hope for a unified culture? Can school provide a centre for these circles, a place of collective learning
– or does it create outcasts at the periphery of society?

The battle for free will in the face of determinism
Oliver Burkeman’s long read pitches philosophical readers against the
more scientifically minded ones
Letters
Fri 30 Apr 2021 03.27 AEST

I read the online version of Oliver Burkeman’s long read that raises the question of whether free will is an illusion, and shortly
afterwards read the same article again in print (The clockwork universe, Journal, 27 April). I was surprised when I realised that
the brief reference to quantum physics online was missing in the printed version. Was it simply a matter of space, or was it left
out because it made the whole argument too complicated? Either way, its omission was unfortunate.
Most physicists would not regard the events in our universe as deterministic, or clockwork if you insist; they are in fact
considered probabilistic and would leave Laplace’s demon scratching its head when attempting to make any long-term
predictions. Quantum theory is fundamental to our understanding of reality, and those “tiny fluctuations” that the article
mentions are an essential part of our reality. They allow the stars to shine, for instance. The argument for determinism implies a
first mover, the unmoved mover, as Thomas Aquinas put it. Perhaps the quantum universe injects a multiplicity of unmoved
movers, all that is needed to disrupt a predictable, in theory at least, deterministic universe and restore the possibility of free
will.
Andrew Bromilow

Oliver Burkeman’s common-sense argument against free-will scepticism – “it’s just at odds with too much else that seems
obviously true about life” – is persuasive. Every hard determinist I’ve ever met seems to agree in practice. I’ve yet to meet one
who didn’t look both ways before crossing the street.

Rev Carl Harding
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria
“The latest resurgence of scepticism [about free will] has been driven by advances in neuroscience,” Oliver Burkeman says.
What this shows, however, is that most people still don’t really get the problem. You don’t get it until you see that nothing in
science could ever make any difference, for reasons that Burkeman gives. That said, it’s worth listening to Albert Einstein echoing
the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza in his contribution to The Golden Book of Tagore, published in 1931: “If the moon,
in the act of completing its eternal way around the earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced
that it was travelling its way of its own accord on the strength of a resolution taken once and for all. So would a Being, endowed
with higher insight and more perfect intelligence, watching man and his doings, smile about man’s illusion that he was acting
according to his own free will.”
Galen Strawson
London
Those who suggest free will is an illusion are ignoring the gap in our understanding of consciousness and its
relationship to the quantum realm in which randomness (ie indeterminism) has been proven to be real by the National Institute
for Science and Technology’s work on a randomness beacon. Causal determinism in the human brain is on a shoogly peg, and it is
likely that Laplace’s demon could no more make accurate predictions about the universe than about a football match, or any
situation where the outcome is influenced by human consciousness. Given our lack of understanding about consciousness, any
argument against free will is at best incomplete and at worst requires a quasi-religious leap of faith around something we do not
understand enough to make such bold claims.
Joe Hind

The theory that our choices are determined by forces that go back to prehistory is pointless and dangerous. Pointless because
any decision taken can be explained by the theory of predetermination or by the common view that people are able to make
choices based on their beliefs, ethical standards and experience. Neither explanation can be proved or disproved. It should
therefore be rejected as of little use for individuals or society. It is dangerous not only because it rids individuals of the
responsibility for their actions but because it can also lead to the same conclusion when nations act irresponsibly towards each
other.
This is not just a question for the academic world. There are political “realists” who contend that a rising power like China will
inevitably clash with the established world power that is the US. This is where the “clockwork” world can lead us.
Our environment and genes are the main factors that shape who we are, but we know that there are many crossroads in life
where the road less travelled was the one that we should have taken. Free will needs to be defended against the determinists.
Derek Heptinstall
Westgate-on-Sea, Kent
I bought the Guardian on Tuesday after I saw the front-page trail: “Is free will just an illusion?” I don’t buy the Guardian often,
simply because I can’t afford it, but I couldn’t ignore this. Surely according to quantum physics all possibilities exist at every
moment in time, so the possibility of the existence of free will exists simultaneously with the possibility of not free will?
Margaret Forbes
Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire
The problem with the assertion that free will is an illusion is that it carries inescapable consequences for the ability of our
intelligence to arrive at an adequation of the truth. Notwithstanding that education, cultural background and character affect our
cognitive reasoning, to have any hope of knowing anything truly, we must be capable of objectivity and therefore, by definition,
free in our thought to some degree. If we are always deterministically fated to be led down a wired neural pathway towards a
conclusion that we cannot escape, we have no real basis for assuming that it bears any relation to the actual nature of things.
If free will is an illusion, then so is true knowledge. And this would then also apply to our capacity to know the true nature of free
will. Is Oliver Burkeman not fatally determined to arrive at the conclusion he has, regardless of whether it is actually true or not?
In which case, I’m not sure we can really say his conclusion is true.
Khalid Naqib
Chilton, Buckinghamshire
I read Oliver Burkeman’s article with increasing frustration. To propose a mechanistic universe in which every effect of a cause
is precisely determined ignores modern scientific thinking. Chaos theory tells us of the “butterfly effect”, whereby even a very
small variation in initial conditions can lead to an extremely large difference in later results. And quantum theory tells us that, at
the subatomic level, we can only say that a given range of effects has a probability (which we might be able to calculate) of
resulting from that cause. Schrödinger’s cat has a 50% chance of survival. We do not know, even given the most precise
knowledge conceivable of today’s conditions, what will happen tomorrow.
Burkeman is contrasting two extreme theories, of unfettered free will and Laplace’s demon, when the truth lies somewhere in
between. Surely the truth is that we have free will, but the options available to us and our likely preferences are influenced to
varying degrees by things beyond our control?

The battle for free will in the face of determinism | Letters | The Guardian

The free will debate is surely the most fruitless in all philosophy. Imagine a world with free will. Now imagine a world without.
Would there be the slightest difference? And the argument that if there is no free will then there is no responsibility and so
punishment is unjustified is spurious. In such a world we would also lack the free will to choose whether to punish. I feel I have
no choice but to believe in free will.
Jim Watson
Stroud, Gloucestershire
The long read reminded me of the test to distinguish between a scientist and an engineer. With the candidate at one end of a
long room and a highly desirable prize at the other, the candidate is allowed to travel half of the intervening space on each
command to move. The scientist, of course, instantly recognises that it is impossible to reach the goal in a finite time and remains
standing, whereas the engineer moves smartly forward to get close enough for all practical purposes as soon as possible. The
principle that every event has a cause is sound, but does that translate to every event being inevitable from the origin of time?
Sure, we can do a thought experiment tracing every event back through its sequence of preceding causes to whatever origin we
choose. If, though, we then allow the system to rerun, the sheer enormity of possible outcomes ensures that the slightest
perturbation at any point will result in a radically different outcome. For all practical purposes, I’m an engineer on this one.
David Woolley
Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire
In my 95 years, I have frequently pondered on the subject question about which much can be said, as Oliver Burkeman
demonstrates. We find it easy to define determinism, but what do we mean by free will?
Say, for example, that I am a beginner at chess and face a checkmate from just two options. My tutor points out a third, which
recovers the situation. Was my free choice the same as theirs?
My hopeless situation induces me to resign from the game. My opponent insists I continue to the end. I comply and
unexpectedly achieve a draw. Would I have offered to resign had I known the eventual outcome?
Few choices in life are between an apple and a banana. Almost always, we don’t know all the options, or their outcomes. The real
choice is between the outcomes, which requires us to know the future. We have to guess that. My conclusion is that determinism
is so complex that for all practical purposes it may be discarded, but that for the same reason we must discard the notion of free
will.
HS Grünewald
Pinner, London
As a physicist and engineer, I have my own views on free will and religion. Quantum mechanics was not as issue for the earlier
philosophers who considered a Newtonian world of perfect prediction given perfect knowledge. That is no longer considered
true. Apart from the obvious quantum truth that nothing can be measured perfectly, any interaction between particles can have
only probabilistic outcomes.
For example, in the article two examples are given in which a person acts strangely as a result of cancer. Cancer is generally the
result of a chemical or radiation incident, which is totally random and unpredictable. The human body has many mechanisms
that may or may not repair the original cancerous cell. This could not be predicted a year in advance, certainly not at birth, and
absolutely not as the outcome of generations of procreation, each of which involves one sperm out of millions, chosen at
random.
Coming from a different angle, if someone commits a homicidal outrage, which may or may not be the result of free will, surely I
and my community should have equal freedom to react with a punishment, which may or may not be the result of a free-will
decision. If a person is driven to antisocial action, their actions, whether a result of free will or not, are likely to take into account
the likelihood of punishment. If society regards actions as punishable, those actions will be somewhat less likely than if not.
I regard “punishment” as less important than deterrence and prevention; in many cases, there is no real gain but a high cost in
imprisonment. In other cases, the important function of imprisonment is isolation from society, thereby avoiding further harm.
But I am a scientist and engineer, not a moral philosopher and legislator or judge.

owards the end of a conversation dwelling on some of the deepest
metaphysical puzzles regarding the nature of human existence, the
philosopher Galen Strawson paused, then asked me: “Have you spoken to
anyone else yet who’s received weird email?” He navigated to a file on his
computer and began reading from the alarming messages he and several other
scholars had received over the past few years. Some were plaintive, others abusive,
but all were fiercely accusatory. “Last year you all played a part in destroying my
life,” one person wrote. “I lost everything because of you – my son, my partner, my
job, my home, my mental health. All because of you, you told me I had no control,
how I was not responsible for anything I do, how my beautiful six-year-old son was
not responsible for what he did … Goodbye, and good luck with the rest of your
cancerous, evil, pathetic existence.” “Rot in your own shit Galen,” read another note,
sent in early 2015. “Your wife, your kids your friends, you have smeared all there
[sic] achievements you utter fucking prick,” wrote the same person, who
subsequently warned: “I’m going to fuck you up.” And then, days later, under the
subject line “Hello”: “I’m coming for you.” “This was one where we had to involve
the police,” Strawson said. Thereafter, the violent threats ceased.
It isn’t unheard of for philosophers to receive death threats. The Australian ethicist
Peter Singer, for example, has received many, in response to his argument that, in
highly exceptional circumstances, it might be morally justifiable to kill newborn
babies with severe disabilities. But Strawson, like others on the receiving end of this
particular wave of abuse, had merely expressed a longstanding position in an
ancient debate that strikes many as the ultimate in “armchair philosophy”, wholly
detached from the emotive entanglements of real life. They all deny that human
beings possess free will. They argue that our choices are determined by forces
beyond our ultimate control – perhaps even predetermined all the way back to the
big bang – and that therefore nobody is ever wholly responsible for their actions.
Reading back over the emails, Strawson, who gives the impression of someone far
more forgiving of other people’s flaws than of his own, found himself empathising
with his harassers’ distress. “I think for these people it’s just an existential
catastrophe,” he said. “And I think I can see why.”
The difficulty in explaining the enigma of free will to those
unfamiliar with the subject isn’t that it’s complex or obscure. It’s that the experience
of possessing free will – the feeling that we are the authors of our choices – is so
utterly basic to everyone’s existence that it can be hard to get enough mental
distance to see what’s going on. Suppose you find yourself feeling moderately
hungry one afternoon, so you walk to the fruit bowl in your kitchen, where you see
one apple and one banana. As it happens, you choose the banana. But it seems
absolutely obvious that you were free to choose the apple – or neither, or both –

instead. That’s free will: were you to rewind the tape of world history, to the instant
just before you made your decision, with everything in the universe exactly the
same, you’d have been able to make a different one.
Nothing could be more self-evident. And yet according to a growing chorus of
philosophers and scientists, who have a variety of different reasons for their view, it
also can’t possibly be the case. “This sort of free will is ruled out, simply and
decisively, by the laws of physics,” says one of the most strident of the free will
sceptics, the evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne. Leading psychologists such as
Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom agree, as apparently did the late Stephen Hawking,
along with numerous prominent neuroscientists, including VS Ramachandran, who
called free will “an inherently flawed and incoherent concept” in his endorsement of
Sam Harris’s bestselling 2012 book Free Will, which also makes that argument.
According to the public intellectual Yuval Noah Harari, free will is an anachronistic
myth – useful in the past, perhaps, as a way of motivating people to fight against
tyrants or oppressive ideologies, but rendered obsolete by the power of modern data
science to know us better than we know ourselves, and thus to predict and
manipulate our choices.
Arguments against free will go back millennia, but the latest resurgence of
scepticism has been driven by advances in neuroscience during the past few
decades. Now that it’s possible to observe – thanks to neuroimaging – the physical
brain activity associated with our decisions, it’s easier to think of those decisions as
just another part of the mechanics of the material universe, in which “free will”
plays no role. And from the 1980s onwards, various specific neuroscientific findings
have offered troubling clues that our so-called free choices might actually originate
in our brains several milliseconds, or even much longer, before we’re first aware of
even thinking of them.
Despite the criticism that this is all just armchair philosophy, the truth is that the
stakes could hardly be higher. Were free will to be shown to be nonexistent – and
were we truly to absorb the fact – it would “precipitate a culture war far more
belligerent than the one that has been waged on the subject of evolution”, Harris has
written. Arguably, we would be forced to conclude that it was unreasonable ever to
praise or blame anyone for their actions, since they weren’t truly responsible for
deciding to do them; or to feel guilt for one’s misdeeds, pride in one’s
accomplishments, or gratitude for others’ kindness. And we might come to feel that
it was morally unjustifiable to mete out retributive punishment to criminals, since
they had no ultimate choice about their wrongdoing. Some worry that it might
fatally corrode all human relations, since romantic love, friendship and neighbourly
civility alike all depend on the assumption of choice: any loving or respectful gesture
has to be voluntary for it to count.
Peer over the precipice of the free will debate for a while, and you begin to
appreciate how an already psychologically vulnerable person might be nudged into a

breakdown, as was apparently the case with Strawson’s email correspondents.
Harris has taken to prefacing his podcasts on free will with disclaimers, urging those
who find the topic emotionally distressing to give them a miss. And Saul Smilansky,
a professor of philosophy at the University of Haifa in Israel, who believes the
popular notion of free will is a mistake, told me that if a graduate student who was
prone to depression sought to study the subject with him, he would try to dissuade
them. “Look, I’m naturally a buoyant person,” he said. “I have the mentality of a
village idiot: it’s easy to make me happy. Nevertheless, the free will problem is really
depressing if you take it seriously. It hasn’t made me happy, and in retrospect, if I
were at graduate school again, maybe a different topic would have been preferable.”
Smilansky is an advocate of what he calls “illusionism”, the idea that although free
will as conventionally defined is unreal, it’s crucial people go on believing otherwise
– from which it follows that an article like this one might be actively dangerous.
(Twenty years ago, he said, he might have refused to speak to me, but these days
free will scepticism was so widely discussed that “the horse has left the barn”.) “On
the deepest level, if people really understood what’s going on – and I don’t think I’ve
fully internalised the implications myself, even after all these years – it’s just too
frightening and difficult,” Smilansky said. “For anyone who’s morally and
emotionally deep, it’s really depressing and destructive. It would really threaten our
sense of self, our sense of personal value. The truth is just too awful here.”

T

he conviction that nobody ever truly chooses freely to do anything – that
we’re the puppets of forces beyond our control – often seems to strike its
adherents early in their intellectual careers, in a sudden flash of insight. “I
was sitting in a carrel in Wolfson College [in Oxford] in 1975, and I had no
idea what I was going to write my DPhil thesis about,” Strawson recalled. “I was
reading something about Kant’s views on free will, and I was just electrified. That
was it.” The logic, once glimpsed, seems coldly inexorable. Start with what seems
like an obvious truth: anything that happens in the world, ever, must have been
completely caused by things that happened before it. And those things must have
been caused by things that happened before them – and so on, backwards to the
dawn of time: cause after cause after cause, all of them following the predictable
laws of nature, even if we haven’t figured all of those laws out yet. It’s easy enough
to grasp this in the context of the straightforwardly physical world of rocks and
rivers and internal combustion engines. But surely “one thing leads to another” in
the world of decisions and intentions, too. Our decisions and intentions involve
neural activity – and why would a neuron be exempt from the laws of physics any
more than a rock?
So in the fruit bowl example, there are physiological reasons for your feeling hungry
in the first place, and there are causes – in your genes, your upbringing, or your
current environment – for your choosing to address your hunger with fruit, rather

than a box of doughnuts. And your preference for the banana over the apple, at the
moment of supposed choice, must have been caused by what went before,
presumably including the pattern of neurons firing in your brain, which was itself
caused – and so on back in an unbroken chain to your birth, the meeting of your
parents, their births and, eventually, the birth of the cosmos.

But if all that’s true, there’s simply no room for the kind of free will you might
imagine yourself to have when you see the apple and banana and wonder which one
you’ll choose. To have what’s known in the scholarly jargon as “contra-causal” free
will – so that if you rewound the tape of history back to the moment of choice, you
could make a different choice – you’d somehow have to slip outside physical reality.
To make a choice that wasn’t merely the next link in the unbroken chain of causes,
you’d have to be able to stand apart from the whole thing, a ghostly presence
separate from the material world yet mysteriously still able to influence it. But of
course you can’t actually get to this supposed place that’s external to the universe,
separate from all the atoms that comprise it and the laws that govern them. You just
are some of the atoms in the universe, governed by the same predictable laws as all
the rest.
It was the French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace, writing in 1814, who most
succinctly expressed the puzzle here: how can there be free will, in a universe where
events just crank forwards like clockwork? His thought experiment is known as
Laplace’s demon, and his argument went as follows: if some hypothetical ultraintelligent being – or demon – could somehow know the position of every atom in
the universe at a single point in time, along with all the laws that governed their

interactions, it could predict the future in its entirety. There would be nothing it
couldn’t know about the world 100 or 1,000 years hence, down to the slightest
quiver of a sparrow’s wing. You might think you made a free choice to marry your
partner, or choose a salad with your meal rather than chips; but in fact Laplace’s
demon would have known it all along, by extrapolating out along the endless chain
of causes. “For such an intellect,” Laplace said, “nothing could be uncertain, and the
future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes.”
It’s true that since Laplace’s day, findings in quantum physics have indicated that
some events, at the level of atoms and electrons, are genuinely random, which
means they would be impossible to predict in advance, even by some hypothetical
megabrain. But few people involved in the free will debate think that makes a
critical difference. Those tiny fluctuations probably have little relevant impact on
life at the scale we live it, as human beings. And in any case, there’s no more
freedom in being subject to the random behaviours of electrons than there is in
being the slave of predetermined causal laws. Either way, something other than your
own free will seems to be pulling your strings.

B

y far the most unsettling implication of the case against free will, for most
who encounter it, is what it seems to say about morality: that nobody,
ever, truly deserves reward or punishment for what they do, because what
they do is the result of blind deterministic forces (plus maybe a little
quantum randomness). “For the free will sceptic,” writes Gregg Caruso in his new
book Just Deserts, a collection of dialogues with his fellow philosopher Daniel
Dennett, “it is never fair to treat anyone as morally responsible.” Were we to accept
the full implications of that idea, the way we treat each other – and especially the
way we treat criminals – might change beyond recognition.
Consider the case of Charles Whitman. Just after midnight on 1 August 1966,
Whitman – an outgoing and apparently stable 25-year-old former US Marine – drove
to his mother’s apartment in Austin, Texas, where he stabbed her to death. He
returned home, where he killed his wife in the same manner. Later that day, he took
an assortment of weapons to the top of a high building on the campus of the
University of Texas, where he began shooting randomly for about an hour and a half.
By the time Whitman was killed by police, 12 more people were dead, and one more
died of his injuries years afterwards – a spree that remains the US’s 10th worst mass
shooting.
Within hours of the massacre, the authorities discovered a note that Whitman had
typed the night before. “I don’t quite understand what compels me to type this
letter,” he wrote. “Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have
recently performed. I don’t really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be
an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I can’t recall

when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts
[which] constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate
on useful and progressive tasks … After my death I wish that an autopsy would be
performed to see if there is any visible physical disorder.” Following the first two
murders, he added a coda: “Maybe research can prevent further tragedies of this
type.” An autopsy was performed, revealing the presence of a substantial brain
tumour, pressing on Whitman’s amygdala, the part of the brain governing “fight or
flight” responses to fear.
As the free will sceptics who draw on Whitman’s case concede, it’s impossible to
know if the brain tumour caused Whitman’s actions. What seems clear is that it
certainly could have done so – and that almost everyone, on hearing about it,
undergoes some shift in their attitude towards him. It doesn’t make the killings any
less horrific. Nor does it mean the police weren’t justified in killing him. But it does
make his rampage start to seem less like the evil actions of an evil man, and more
like the terrible symptom of a disorder, with Whitman among its victims. The same
is true for another wrongdoer famous in the free-will literature, the anonymous
subject of the 2003 paper Right Orbitofrontal Tumor with Paedophilia Symptom and
Constructional Apraxia Sign, a 40-year-old schoolteacher who suddenly developed
paedophilic urges and began seeking out child pornography, and was subsequently
convicted of child molestation. Soon afterwards, complaining of headaches, he was
diagnosed with a brain tumour; when it was removed, his paedophilic urges
vanished. A year later, they returned – as had his tumour, detected in another brain
scan.
If you find the presence of a brain tumour in these cases in any way exculpatory,
though, you face a difficult question: what’s so special about a brain tumour, as
opposed to all the other ways in which people’s brains cause them to do things?
When you learn about the specific chain of causes that were unfolding inside Charles
Whitman’s skull, it has the effect of seeming to make him less personally responsible
for the terrible acts he committed. But by definition, anyone who commits any
immoral act has a brain in which a chain of prior causes had unfolded, leading to the
act; if that weren’t the case, they’d never have committed the act. “A neurological
disorder appears to be just a special case of physical events giving rise to thoughts
and actions,” is how Harris expresses it. “Understanding the neurophysiology of the
brain, therefore, would seem to be as exculpatory as finding a tumour in it.” It
appears to follow that as we understand ever more about how the brain works, we’ll
illuminate the last shadows in which something called “free will” might ever have
lurked – and we’ll be forced to concede that a criminal is merely someone unlucky
enough to find himself at the end of a causal chain that culminates in a crime. We
can still insist the crime in question is morally bad; we just can’t hold the criminal
individually responsible. (Or at least that’s where the logic seems to lead our modern
minds: there’s a rival tradition, going back to the ancient Greeks, which holds that
you can be held responsible for what’s fated to happen to you anyway.)

For Caruso, who teaches philosophy at the State University of New York, what all
this means is that retributive punishment – punishing a criminal because he
deserves it, rather than to protect the public, or serve as a warning to others – can’t
ever be justified. Like Strawson, he has received email abuse from people disturbed
by the implications. Retribution is central to all modern systems of criminal justice,
yet ultimately, Caruso thinks, “it’s a moral injustice to hold someone responsible for
actions that are beyond their control. It’s capricious.” Indeed some psychological
research, he points out, suggests that people believe in free will partly because they
want to justify their appetite for retribution. “What seems to happen is that people
come across an action they disapprove of; they have a high desire to blame or
punish; so they attribute to the perpetrator the degree of control [over their own
actions] that would be required to justify blaming them.” (It’s no accident that the
free will controversy is entangled in debates about religion: following similar logic,
sinners must freely choose to sin, in order for God’s retribution to be justified.)
Caruso is an advocate of what he calls the “public health-quarantine” model of
criminal justice, which would transform the institutions of punishment in a radically
humane direction. You could still restrain a murderer, on the same rationale that you
can require someone infected by Ebola to observe a quarantine: to protect the
public. But you’d have no right to make the experience any more unpleasant than
was strictly necessary for public protection. And you would be obliged to release
them as soon as they no longer posed a threat. (The main focus, in Caruso’s ideal
world, would be on redressing social problems to try stop crime happening in the
first place – just as public health systems ought to focus on preventing epidemics
happening to begin with.)

It’s tempting to try to wriggle out of these ramifications by protesting that, while
people might not choose their worst impulses – for murder, say – they do have the
choice not to succumb to them. You can feel the urge to kill someone but resist it, or
even seek psychiatric help. You can take responsibility for the state of your
personality. And don’t we all do that, all the time, in more mundane ways, whenever
we decide to acquire a new professional skill, become a better listener, or finally get
fit?
But this is not the escape clause it might seem. After all, the free will sceptics insist,
if you do manage to change your personality in some admirable way, you must
already have possessed the kind of personality capable of implementing such a
change – and you didn’t choose that. None of this requires us to believe that the
worst atrocities are any less appalling than we previously thought. But it does entail
that the perpetrators can’t be held personally to blame. If you’d been born with
Hitler’s genes, and experienced Hitler’s upbringing, you would be Hitler – and
ultimately it’s only good fortune that you weren’t. In the end, as Strawson puts it,
“luck swallows everything”.

G

iven how watertight the case against free will can appear, it may be
surprising to learn that most philosophers reject it: according to a 2009
survey, conducted by the website PhilPapers, only about 12% of them are
persuaded by it. And the disagreement can be fraught, partly because free
will denial belongs to a wider trend that drives some philosophers spare – the
tendency for those trained in the hard sciences to make sweeping pronouncements
about debates that have raged in philosophy for years, as if all those dull-witted
scholars were just waiting for the physicists and neuroscientists to show up. In one
chilly exchange, Dennett paid a backhanded compliment to Harris, who has a PhD in
neuroscience, calling his book “remarkable” and “valuable” – but only because it
was riddled with so many wrongheaded claims: “I am grateful to Harris for saying,
so boldly and clearly, what less outgoing scientists are thinking but keeping to
themselves.”
What’s still more surprising, and hard to wrap one’s mind around, is that most of
those who defend free will don’t reject the sceptics’ most dizzying assertion – that
every choice you ever make might have been determined in advance. So in the fruit
bowl example, a majority of philosophers agree that if you rewound the tape of
history to the moment of choice, with everything in the universe exactly the same,
you couldn’t have made a different selection. That kind of free will is “as illusory as
poltergeists”, to quote Dennett. What they claim instead is that this doesn’t matter:
that even though our choices may be determined, it makes sense to say we’re free to
choose. That’s why they’re known as “compatibilists”: they think determinism and
free will are compatible. (There are many other positions in the debate, including
some philosophers, many Christians among them, who think we really do have

“ghostly” free will; and others who think the whole so-called problem is a chimera,
resulting from a confusion of categories, or errors of language.)
To those who find the case against free will persuasive, compatibilism seems
outrageous at first glance. How can we possibly be free to choose if we aren’t, in fact,
you know, free to choose? But to grasp the compatibilists’ point, it helps first to
think about free will not as a kind of magic, but as a mundane sort of skill – one
which most adults possess, most of the time. As the compatibilist Kadri Vihvelin
writes, “we have the free will we think we have, including the freedom of action we
think we have … by having some bundle of abilities and being in the right kind of
surroundings.” The way most compatibilists see things, “being free” is just a matter
of having the capacity to think about what you want, reflect on your desires, then
act on them and sometimes get what you want. When you choose the banana in the
normal way – by thinking about which fruit you’d like, then taking it – you’re clearly
in a different situation from someone who picks the banana because a fruit-obsessed
gunman is holding a pistol to their head; or someone afflicted by a banana addiction,
compelled to grab every one they see. In all of these scenarios, to be sure, your
actions belonged to an unbroken chain of causes, stretching back to the dawn of
time. But who cares? The banana-chooser in one of them was clearly more free than
in the others.
“Harris, Pinker, Coyne – all these scientists, they all make the same two-step move,”
said Eddy Nahmias, a compatibilist philosopher at Georgia State University in the
US. “Their first move is always to say, ‘well, here’s what free will means’” – and it’s
always something nobody could ever actually have, in the reality in which we live.
“And then, sure enough, they deflate it. But once you have that sort of balloon in
front of you, it’s very easy to deflate it, because any naturalistic account of the world
will show that it’s false.”

Consider hypnosis. A doctrinaire free will sceptic might feel obliged to argue that a
person hypnotised into making a particular purchase is no less free than someone
who thinks about it, in the usual manner, before reaching for their credit card. After
all, their idea of free will requires that the choice wasn’t fully determined by prior
causes; yet in both cases, hypnotised and non-hypnotised, it was. “But come on,
that’s just really annoying,” said Helen Beebee, a philosopher at the University of
Manchester who has written widely on free will, expressing an exasperation
commonly felt by compatibilists toward their rivals’ more outlandish claims. “In
some sense, I don’t care if you call it ‘free will’ or ‘acting freely’ or anything else – it’s
just that it obviously does matter, to everybody, whether they get hypnotised into
doing things or not.”
Granted, the compatibilist version of free will may be less exciting. But it doesn’t
follow that it’s worthless. Indeed, it may be (in another of Dennett’s phrases) the
only kind of “free will worth wanting”. You experience the desire for a certain fruit,
you act on it, and you get the fruit, with no external gunmen or internal disorders
influencing your choice. How could a person ever be freer than that?
Thinking of free will this way also puts a different spin on some notorious
experiments conducted in the 80s by the American neuroscientist Benjamin Libet,
which have been interpreted as offering scientific proof that free will doesn’t exist.
Wiring his subjects to a brain scanner, and asking them to flex their hands at a
moment of their choosing, Libet seemed to show that their choice was detectable
from brain activity 300 milliseconds before they made a conscious decision. (Other
studies have indicated activity up to 10 seconds before a conscious choice.) How

could these subjects be said to have reached their decisions freely, if the lab
equipment knew their decisions so far in advance? But to most compatibilists, this is
a fuss about nothing. Like everything else, our conscious choices are links in a causal
chain of neural processes, so of course some brain activity precedes the moment at
which we become aware of them.
From this down-to-earth perspective, there’s also no need to start panicking that
cases like Charles Whitman’s might mean we could never hold anybody responsible
for their misdeeds, or praise them for their achievements. (In their defence, several
free will sceptics I spoke to had their reasons for not going that far, either.) Instead,
we need only ask whether someone had the normal ability to choose rationally,
reflecting on the implications of their actions. We all agree that newborn babies
haven’t developed that yet, so we don’t blame them for waking us in the night; and
we believe most non-human animals don’t possess it – so few of us rage indignantly
at wasps for stinging us. Someone with a severe neurological or developmental
impairment would surely lack it, too, perhaps including Whitman. But as for
everyone else: “Bernie Madoff is the example I always like to use,” said Nahmias.
“Because it’s so clear that he knew what he was doing, and that he knew that what
he was doing was wrong, and he did it anyway.” He did have the ability we call “free
will” – and used it to defraud his investors of more than $17bn.
To the free will sceptics, this is all just a desperate attempt at face-saving and
changing the subject – an effort to redefine free will not as the thing we all feel, when
faced with a choice, but as something else, unworthy of the name. “People hate the
idea that they aren’t agents who can make free choices,” Jerry Coyne has argued.
Harris has accused Dennett of approaching the topic as if he were telling someone
bent on discovering the lost city of Atlantis that they ought to be satisfied with a trip
to Sicily. After all, it meets some of the criteria: it’s an island in the sea, home to a
civilisation with ancient roots. But the facts remain: Atlantis doesn’t exist. And
when it felt like it wasn’t inevitable you’d choose the banana, the truth is that it
actually was.

I

t’s tempting to dismiss the free will controversy as irrelevant to real life, on the
grounds that we can’t help but feel as though we have free will, whatever the
philosophical truth may be. I’m certainly going to keep responding to others as
though they had free will: if you injure me, or someone I love, I can guarantee
I’m going to be furious, instead of smiling indulgently on the grounds that you had
no option. In this experiential sense, free will just seems to be a given.
But is it? When my mind is at its quietest – for example, drinking coffee early in the
morning, before the four-year-old wakes up – things are liable to feel different. In
such moments of relaxed concentration, it seems clear to me that my intentions and
choices, like all my other thoughts and emotions, arise unbidden in my awareness.

There’s no sense in which it feels like I’m their author. Why do I put down my coffee
mug and head to the shower at the exact moment I do so? Because the intention to
do so pops up, caused, no doubt, by all sorts of activity in my brain – but activity that
lies outside my understanding, let alone my command. And it’s exactly the same
when it comes to those weightier decisions that seem to express something
profound about the kind of person I am: whether to attend the funeral of a certain
relative, say, or which of two incompatible career opportunities to pursue. I can
spend hours or even days engaged in what I tell myself is “reaching a decision”
about those, when what I’m really doing, if I’m honest, is just vacillating between
options – until at some unpredictable moment, or when an external deadline forces
the issue, the decision to commit to one path or another simply arises.
This is what Harris means when he declares that, on close inspection, it’s not merely
that free will is an illusion, but that the illusion of free will is itself an illusion: watch
yourself closely, and you don’t even seem to be free. “If one pays sufficient
attention,” he told me by email, “one can notice that there’s no subject in the middle
of experience – there is only experience. And everything we experience simply arises
on its own.” This is an idea with roots in Buddhism, and echoed by others, including
the philosopher David Hume: when you look within, there’s no trace of an internal
commanding officer, autonomously issuing decisions. There’s only mental activity,
flowing on. Or as Arthur Rimbaud wrote, in a letter to a friend in 1871: “I am a
spectator at the unfolding of my thought; I watch it, I listen to it.”
There are reasons to agree with Saul Smilansky that it might be personally and
societally detrimental for too many people to start thinking in this way, even if it
turns out it’s the truth. (Dennett, although he thinks we do have free will, takes a
similar position, arguing that it’s morally irresponsible to promote free-will denial.)
In one set of studies in 2008, the psychologists Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan
Schooler asked one group of participants to read an excerpt from The Astonishing
Hypothesis by Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, in which he
suggests free will is an illusion. The subjects thus primed to doubt the existence of
free will proved significantly likelier than others, in a subsequent stage of the
experiment, to cheat in a test where there was money at stake. Other research has
reported a diminished belief in free will to less willingness to volunteer to help
others, to lower levels of commitment in relationships, and lower levels of gratitude.
Unsuccessful attempts to replicate Vohs and Schooler’s findings have called them
into question. But even if the effects are real, some free will sceptics argue that the
participants in such studies are making a common mistake – and one that might get
cleared up rather rapidly, were the case against free will to become better known
and understood. Study participants who suddenly become immoral seem to be
confusing determinism with fatalism – the idea that if we don’t have free will, then
our choices don’t really matter, so we might as well not bother trying to make good
ones, and just do as we please instead. But in fact it doesn’t follow from our choices
being determined that they don’t matter. It might matter enormously whether you

choose to feed your children a diet rich in vegetables or not; or whether you decide
to check carefully in both directions before crossing a busy road. It’s just that
(according to the sceptics) you don’t get to make those choices freely.
In any case, were free will really to be shown to be nonexistent, the implications
might not be entirely negative. It’s true that there’s something repellent about an
idea that seems to require us to treat a cold-blooded murderer as not responsible for
his actions, while at the same time characterising the love of a parent for a child as
nothing more than what Smilansky calls “the unfolding of the given” – mere blind
causation, devoid of any human spark. But there’s something liberating about it,
too. It’s a reason to be gentler with yourself, and with others. For those of us prone
to being hard on ourselves, it’s therapeutic to keep in the back of your mind the
thought that you might be doing precisely as well as you were always going to be
doing – that in the profoundest sense, you couldn’t have done any more. And for
those of us prone to raging at others for their minor misdeeds, it’s calming to
consider how easily their faults might have been yours. (Sure enough, some research
has linked disbelief in free will to increased kindness.)
Harris argues that if we fully grasped the case against free will, it
would be difficult to hate other people: how can you hate someone you don’t blame
for their actions? Yet love would survive largely unscathed, since love is “the
condition of our wanting those we love to be happy, and being made happy
ourselves by that ethical and emotional connection”, neither of which would be
undermined. And countless other positive aspects of life would be similarly
untouched. As Strawson puts it, in a world without a belief in free will, “strawberries
would still taste just as good”.
Those early-morning moments aside, I personally can’t claim to find the case against
free will ultimately persuasive; it’s just at odds with too much else that seems
obviously true about life. Yet even if only entertained as a hypothetical possibility,
free will scepticism is an antidote to that bleak individualist philosophy which holds
that a person’s accomplishments truly belong to them alone – and that you’ve
therefore only yourself to blame if you fail. It’s a reminder that accidents of birth
might affect the trajectories of our lives far more comprehensively than we realise,
dictating not only the socioeconomic position into which we’re born, but also our
personalities and experiences as a whole: our talents and our weaknesses, our
capacity for joy, and our ability to overcome tendencies toward violence, laziness or
despair, and the paths we end up travelling. There is a deep sense of human
fellowship in this picture of reality – in the idea that, in our utter exposure to forces
beyond our control, we might all be in the same boat, clinging on for our lives, adrift
on the storm-tossed ocean of luck.

The Fate of Free Will
James Gleick

In Free Agents, Kevin Mitchell makes a scientific case for the existence of human agency.

Free Agents: How Evolution Gave Us Free Will
by Kevin J. Mitchell

Nobody was holding a gun to your head when you started reading this. You
made a choice. Surely it felt that way, at least. A sense of agency—of control
over our actions, of continual decision-making—is part of the experience of
being human, moment by moment and day by day. True, we sometimes just
drift, like robots or zombies, but at other times we gird our loins and exert
our will. David Hume defined will nearly three centuries ago as “the internal
impression we feel and are conscious of, when we knowingly give rise to
any new motion of our body, or new perception of our mind.” The feeling
was universal then and it’s universal now.
Yet a peculiar fact about the state of the sciences in the early twenty-first
century is that many authorities—physicists, neuroscientists, and even
philosophers—will tell you that this sense of agency is an illusion. In their
daily lives, these same experts pick out clothing, choose wallpaper, and
order from restaurant menus, but when they study the matter professionally
they doubt that they have chosen freely. They understand “free will” to be a
feeling people have, but no more than that.
For physicists, the problem is that we are made of matter, like every particle
and planet in the universe, and matter is governed by physical laws.
According to the physicist and best-selling author Brian Greene, “We need
to recognize that although the sensation of free will is real, the capacity to
exert free will—the capacity for the human mind to transcend the laws that
control physical progression—is not.” We do not and cannot cause
anything; we are caused. “Our choices are the result of our particles
coursing one way or another through our brains,” he writes.
Our actions are the result of our particles moving this way or that through our
bodies. And all particle motion—whether in a brain, a body, or a baseball—is
controlled by physics and so is fully dictated by mathematical decree.

It is a stern and final lesson: “We are no more than playthings knocked to
and fro by the dispassionate rules of the cosmos.” Nothing to see here.
Move along.
Brain scientists, too, doubt free will and look for root causes—mechanisms
underlying behavior—in the material substrate of what we like to call our
minds. This is reductionism: as physicists begin at the bottom, with
elementary particles, so neuroscientists look to neurons. They tend to reach
the same conclusion: volition is the end, not the cause, of a chain of
electrical and chemical activity. Our desires, intentions, and plans float
above the engine room, the systems of the brain where the real work is
done.
Some people resist the arguments of physics by resorting to stubborn faith,
and it’s hard to blame them. The mathematical philosopher Martin Gardner
remained persuaded that “somehow, in a way utterly beyond our ken, you

and I possess that incomprehensible power we call free will,” but he gave
up trying to explain. “Like time, with which it is linked, free will is best left
—indeed, I believe we cannot do otherwise—an impenetrable mystery. Ask
not how it works because no one on earth can tell you.”
The term “free will” carries a lot of baggage; the constraints of nature and
nurture, our genes and our unconscious habits, our family histories and
social conditions all help determine our behavior and thus make us less
than fully free. The more general term is “agency,” the capacity for
purposeful action. Terminology notwithstanding, the conviction that we act
with some degree of freedom features not just in our private thoughts but
in our public life. Legal institutions, theories of government, and economic
systems are built on the assumption that humans make choices and strive
to influence the choices of others. Without some kind of free will, politics
has no point. Nor does sports. Or anything, really.

N

onetheless, Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and philosopher who wrote
the popular book Free Will (2012), insisted not only that free will is an

illusion but that the concept “cannot be made conceptually coherent.”
Consider it a challenge: “No one has ever described a way in which mental
and physical processes could arise that would attest to the existence of
such freedom.”
Kevin J. Mitchell answers exactly this challenge in Free Agents: How
Evolution Gave Us Free Will. A neuroscientist and geneticist at Trinity
College Dublin, Mitchell sets out to rescue our intuitive sense of agency
from a cloud of obfuscation. Yes, he says, free will exists. It is neither an
illusion nor merely a figure of speech. It is our essential, defining quality
and as such demands explanation. “We make decisions, we choose, we act,”
he declares.
These are the fundamental truths of our existence and absolutely the most basic
phenomenology of our lives. If science seems to be suggesting otherwise, the
correct response is not to throw our hands up and say, “Well, I guess everything
we thought about our own existence is a laughable delusion.” It is to accept
instead that there is a deep mystery to be solved and to realize that we may need
to question the philosophical bedrock of our scientific approach if we are to
reconcile the clear existence of choice with the apparent determinism of the
physical universe.

Agency distinguishes even bacteria from the otherwise lifeless universe.
Living things are “imbued with purpose and able to act on their own
terms,” Mitchell says. He makes a powerful case that the history of life, in
all its complex grandeur, cannot be appreciated until we understand the
evolution of agency—and then, in creatures of sufficient complexity, the
evolution of conscious free will.
Mitchell is one of a new breed of biologists who espouse a complex-systems
perspective as an antidote to reductionism. He aims to reclaim from the
philosophers words like purpose, reason, and meaning, which scientists
often avoid as being unquantifiable. He mostly eschews jargon. This is a
plainspoken book. It gets mildly technical in matters of biology and

neuroscience, but it builds an argument that is methodical and crisp, and it
cuts through years of disputation like a knife through cotton candy. This is
what you are, Mitchell asserts: “You are the type of thing that can take
action, that can make decisions, that can be a causal force in the world: you
are an agent.”
If the denial of free will has been an error, it has not been a harmless one.
Its message is grim and etiolating. It drains purpose and dignity from our
sense of ourselves and, for that matter, of our fellow living creatures. It
releases us from responsibility and treats us as passive objects, like billiard
balls or falling leaves.

W

hat Is Life? was an influential little book by the quantum pioneer
Erwin Schrödinger, assembled from lectures he delivered in Dublin

in 1943. When can we say that a thing is alive? He gave a surprising answer:
When it goes on “doing something,” moving, exchanging material with its
environment, and so forth, and that for a much longer period than we would
expect an inanimate piece of matter to “keep going” under similar
circumstances.

Notice the emphasis on time. First a living organism has to persist. It does
this in defiance of the second law of thermodynamics, which says that the
universe and its contents tend inexorably toward disorder. Left alone, a
sandcastle degrades to a pile of sand. Cream disperses into the coffee.
Everything in a closed system arrives at the same temperature, because
entropy’s disorder also implies equilibrium. Against this universal tendency,
the organism fights back. It sucks order out of disorder.
“The organism is not a pattern of stuff,” Mitchell says; “it is a pattern of
interacting processes, and the self is that pattern persisting.” Within the first
single-celled organisms the raw materials were already in place for the
mechanism of replication famously described by James Watson and Francis
Crick in 1953. Nucleic acids—RNA and DNA—act as templates, complex
macromolecules storing information in a coded sequence. The code in DNA
remains chemically stable, while the RNA molecules read its information
and replicate it. Cells could divide, making copies of themselves. Then they
could evolve.
This part of the story is well known. Populations of microorganisms
compete for resources. Random errors in the transcription process create
mutations. Some organisms compete more effectively than others, and thus
nature selects the fittest to survive. It’s worth noting that all the elementary
particles engaged in this activity are obeying the laws of motion, but the
processes that interest us—metabolism, reproduction, mutation—take
place on a different scale of complexity and abstraction. It may seem
paradoxical, but just because laws of physics apply to everything doesn’t
mean they explain everything. Sometimes they just aren’t the right tool. The
equations of particle physicists don’t explain evolution any more than they
explain genes or epidemics.

Biological entities develop across time, and as they do, they store and
exchange information. “That extension through time generates a new kind
of causation that is not seen in most physical processes,” Mitchell says,
“one based on a record of history in which information about past events
continues to play a causal role in the present.” Within even a single-celled
organism, proteins in the cell wall respond chemically to changing
conditions outside and thus act as sensors. Inside, proteins are activated
and deactivated by biochemical reactions, and the organism effectively
reconfigures its own metabolic pathways in order to survive. Those
pathways can act as logic gates in a computer: if the conditions are X, then
do A.
“They’re not thinking about it, of course,” Mitchell says, “but that is the
effect, and it’s built right into the design of the molecule.” As organisms
grow more complex, so do these logical pathways. They create feedback
mechanisms, positive and negative. They make molecular clocks,
responding to and then mimicking the solar cycle. Increasingly, they
embody knowledge of the world in which they live.
The tiniest microorganisms also developed means of propulsion by
changing their shape or deploying cilia and flagella, tiny vibrating hairs. The
ability to move, combined with the ability to sense surroundings, created
new possibilities—seeking food, escaping danger—continually amplified by
natural selection. We begin to see organisms extracting information from
their environment, acting on it in the present, and reproducing it for the
future. “Information thus has causal power in the system,” Mitchell says,
“and gives the agent causal power in the world.”
We can begin to talk about purpose. First of all, organisms struggle to
maintain themselves. They strive to persist and then to reproduce. Natural
selection ensures it. “The universe doesn’t have purpose, but life does,”
Mitchell says.
And unlike the designed machines and gadgets that surround us in our daily
lives, which also have a purpose or at least serve a purpose, living organisms are
adapted for the sake of only one thing—their selves. This brings something new
to the universe: a frame of reference, a subject. The existence of a goal imbues
things with properties that previously never existed relative to that goal:
function, meaning, and value.

And yet—impressed though we may be when we contemplate the
paramecium, its oblong single cell covered in motile hairs, spiraling through
the water in response to electrical signals sent by ion receptors, gathering
food and avoiding obstacles and even forming symbiotic relationships with
other organisms—no one would say that it has will, free or otherwise.

A

determinist believes that whatever happens had to happen. The laws
of nature carry the present into the future like gears in an unyielding

machine or like the sequential states of a computer. It’s no mystery why
physicists are drawn to determinism: the laws of nature are their bread and
butter. The canonical expression of scientific determinism came from
Pierre-Simon Laplace, an enthusiastic disciple of Newton:

An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well
as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to
comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as
the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently
powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the
future as well as the past would be present to its eyes.

As far as the equations of motion are concerned, the future and the past
look the same. Einstein formalized this picture two centuries later when he
envisioned the universe as a four-dimensional space-time continuum.
“Everything is determined,” he said,
the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is
determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human being, vegetables or
cosmic dust, we all dance to an invisible tune, intoned in the distance by a
mysterious player.

Is there no room for slippage in the gears? As it happens, there is. When
physicists attempt to carry out Laplace’s program, they discover that they
cannot perfectly specify the state of even the smallest, simplest particle.
This is the famous uncertainty principle: Werner Heisenberg established in
the 1920s that the more precisely one determines a particle’s position, the
less one can specify its momentum. This is sometimes discussed as a
matter of epistemology, of what an observer can know, but the problem is
more fundamental. No human needs to be part of the picture. The
uncertainty is a feature of the universe.
Theorists handled this troublesome discovery by replacing Newtonian
mechanics with a new mathematical system. Quantum mechanics treats
particles as waves of probability via a wave function, using an equation that
Schrödinger devised. The Schrödinger equation enables physicists to
calculate—with astonishing success—how a quantum system evolves over
time. Like Newton’s laws of motion, the Schrödinger equation is
deterministic in form. When physicists rerun the calculation, they always
get the same answer, perforce. Once again, in quantum mechanics the
current state of the universe seems to determine the next state.
This is why so many modern physicists continue to embrace philosophical
determinism. But their theories are deterministic because they’ve written
them that way. We say that the laws govern the universe, but that is a
metaphor; it is better to say that the laws describe what is known. In a way
the mistake begins with the word “laws.” The laws aren’t instructions for
nature to follow. Saying that the world is “controlled” by physics—that
everything is “dictated” by mathematics—is putting the cart before the
horse. Nature comes first. The laws are a model, a simplified description of
a complex reality. No matter how successful, they necessarily remain
incomplete and provisional.
Furthermore, quantum calculations of the wave function produce not a
specific result but rather a probability distribution—hence the predicament
of Schrödinger’s hapless cat, neither dead nor alive until the wave function

“collapses.” Some physicists do agree that indeterminacy cannot be swept
away but remains inherent at every level. “The upshot of these views is that
the future is open: indeed, that is what makes it the future,” Mitchell writes.
Because we only inhabit the present we don’t experience this indeterminacy
first-hand…. If we could really glimpse the future, we would see a world out of
focus. Not separate paths already neatly laid out, waiting to be chosen—just a
fuzzy, jittery picture that gets fuzzier and jitterier the further into the future you
look.

Between the strict regime of physical determinism and the naive feeling of
free will is an uneasy territory where we find many leading philosophers.
What if, they ask, we could describe some version of free will, or something
like free will, that is compatible with determinism? This approach is called
compatibilism. Compatibilists argue that even if we accept that the future is
already fixed, we can still talk about psychological freedom in a way that
preserves concepts like moral responsibility.
Daniel Dennett made the modern case for compatibilism in his 1984 book
Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting—as he put it, he was
“saving everything that mattered about the everyday concept of free will,
while jettisoning the impediments.” (Updating Elbow Room in 2014, he
expressed some frustration with the never-ending debate: “It is fair to say
that I underestimated the persistence of some of the ideas I sought to
dismantle and discredit in the 1980s.”) Compatibilism comes in many
flavors, but the essential point is to set physics aside, leave it quietly in the
corner, and study the ways in which people speak of free will, the deep
questions on which it touches, the consequences for behavior and ethics—
in short, to continue the investigation of free will as if the universe had
room for such a thing.
Mitchell could have made his argument a compatibilist one. Dennett did
something like that, exploring many of the same themes, in his 2017 book
From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds. But Mitchell finds
it unsatisfying to act as if “a perspectival shift is all that is needed to get us
out of the metaphysical hole we seem to find ourselves in.” He wants to say,
yes, we live in a materialistic universe; yes, the laws of physics apply; yet the
future is not yet written, and living things have the power to change it.

R

ejecting the reductionist view does not mean resorting to mind–body
dualism—positing some extra, nonphysical entity, like a soul or a

spirit. There is no ghost in this machine. “Our minds are not an extra layer
sitting above our physical brains,” Mitchell says. They are the holistic sum
of that continuous, dynamic, distributed activity.
The brain is material, and its parts are increasingly well understood. Where
the earliest organisms had protein sensors and ion pathways to perform the
most basic kind of information processing, we have networks of neurons
firing electrical signals that excite or inhibit others, organized by the
millions in columns and sheets—“levels and levels of internal processing in
which information is being processed, parsed, and transformed from each
cortical area to the next,” as Mitchell says. On top of information about

smell and touch come increasingly complex signals from the visual and
auditory cortices. These inputs are combined and layered to reveal higherorder relationships, and in this way organisms build up internal models of
the external world.
It’s still just chemistry and electricity, but the state of the brain at one
instant does not lead inexorably to the next. Mitchell emphasizes the
inherent noisiness of the system: more or less random fluctuations that
occur in an assemblage of “wet, jiggly, incomprehensibly tiny components
that jitter about constantly.” He believes that the noise is not just inevitable;
it’s useful. It has adaptive value for organisms that live, after all, in an
environment subject to change and surprise. “The challenges facing
organisms vary from moment to moment,” he notes, “and the nervous
system has to cope with that volatility: that is precisely what it is
specialized to do.” But merely adding randomness to a deterministic
machine still doesn’t produce anything we would call free will.
Free will, as distinct from agency, implies consciousness and self-reflection.
Yet so much of what we do is involuntary. Many neurologists see
involuntary behavior as the norm and the sensation of willing as a sometime
adjunct. They have a litany of examples of action disconnected from will.
We breathe, we blink, we daydream, we scratch, we blush, we reach for a
glass, we drift to sleep (easier than willing ourselves to sleep), we walk the
same familiar route, all without a moment’s thought. Memories appear
unbidden. Daniel M. Wegner illustrated his influential 2002 text The Illusion
of Conscious Will with a picture of Dr. Strangelove (played by Peter Sellers in
Stanley Kubrick’s film), whose black-gloved right hand kept shooting up in
an involuntary Nazi salute. “Alien hand syndrome,” Wegner explains, is a
genuine disorder “in which a person experiences one hand as operating
with a mind of its own.” The hand acts contrary to the patient’s conscious
intent, at least as the patient perceives it.
We may think it’s normal for action to coincide with will, but Wegner argues
otherwise:
They come apart often enough to make one wonder whether they may be
produced by separate systems in the mind…. As soon as we accept the idea that
the will should be understood as an experience of the person who acts, we realize
that conscious will is not inherent in action—there are actions that have it and
actions that don’t.

People have multiple “personalities.” They say, “I am torn.” They have an
angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other.
Give the free-will deniers their due: in all these ways and more, the idea of
our conscious self as a trustworthy and competent master of our destiny—a
pilot in the cockpit—has badly frayed. Even on our best days we’re subject
to delusion and confusion. We act without thinking, from habit or reflex or
instinct. We behave impulsively, for no reasons we can discern. Yet
unconscious decision-making is still decision-making. And sometimes we
do think. We reflect, ponder, dither, weigh alternatives for some time before
choosing to act.

A

touchstone for neuroscientists who doubt free will is a series of
controversial experiments conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s.

Libet, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco,
attached electrodes to participants’ scalps and asked them to move a finger
whenever they chose and to report the instant of making the decision. He
found that brain activity relating to the finger began many milliseconds
before the awareness of any decision. If the conscious decision came after
the action, how could it be the cause? “The position of conscious will in the
time line suggests perhaps that the experience of will is a link in a causal
chain leading to action, but in fact it might not even be that,” Wegner wrote.
“It might just be a loose end—one of those things, like the action, that is
caused by prior brain and mental events.”
But somebody moved those fingers. No one suggests they had marionette
strings attached. Sam Harris says that “I” don’t choose; choices are made
“by events in my brain that I, as the conscious witness of my thoughts and
actions, could not inspect or influence.” But where is the line that separates
events in my brain from the conscious witness? Let’s say instead: We make
choices. We make decisions. Some of our decision-making is prolonged and
thoughtful, while some is spontaneous and practically random. We may
understand our choices, we may rationalize them, or they may remain
mysterious and obscure.
Mitchell proposes what he calls a “more naturalized concept of the self.”
We are not just our consciousness; we’re the organism, taken as a whole.
We do things for reasons based on our histories, and “those reasons inhere
at the level of the whole organism.” Much of the time, perhaps most of the
time, our conscious self is not in control. Still, when the occasion requires,
we can gather our wits, as the expression goes. We have so many
expressions like that—get a grip; pull yourself together; focus your thoughts—
metaphors for the indistinct things we see when we look inward. We don’t
ask who is gathering whose wits.
Mitchell points out that the Libet experiment was designed to encourage
randomness: subjects were told to “let the urge to act appear on its own at
any time without any preplanning or concentration on when to act.” But
some decisions may well be unconsidered, spontaneous, or even random,
while others involve careful deliberation:
Overall then, Libet’s experiments have very little relevance for the question of
free will. They do not relate to deliberative decisions at all…. Instead, they
confirm, first, that neural activity in the brain is not completely deterministic
and, second, that organisms can choose to harness the inherent randomness to
make arbitrary decisions in a timely fashion. It is likely that we do this all the
time, without being aware of it.

Indeed, some degree of randomness is essential to Mitchell’s neural model
for agency and decision-making. He lays out a two-stage model: the
gathering of options—possible actions for the organism to take—followed
by a process of selection. For us, organisms capable of conscious free will,
the options arise as patterns of activity in the cerebral cortex, always
subject to fluctuations and noise. We may experience this as “ideas just

‘occurring to you.’” Then the brain evaluates these options, with “upvoting” and “down-voting,” by means of “interlocking circuit loops among
the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain.” In that way, selection
employs goals and beliefs built from experience, stored in memory, and still
more or less malleable.
The primitive single-celled organism moves and eats without thinking. We
humans also move and eat, and we think about it. On the way from there to
here, nature created organisms of increasing ability. Multicellular creatures
developed specialized morphology, including linked neurons and grouped
muscle cells, communicating with one another through chemical signals.
Organs for vision and hearing became valuable means of gathering
information about the environment. Complex networks of neurons gained
the ability to store symbolic representations of the world and its parts,
including, eventually, representations of the self, distinguished from
everything else. All this happened; there’s nothing controversial about it.

W

e can compare different organisms by looking at their cognitive

depth. Humans are admirably deep. “If a nematode worm could be
said to be thinking, it’s certainly not thinking about much,” Mitchell says.
It may integrate a few signals at a time and can do simple forms of learning, but
it doesn’t create much of a map of the world or its own self and doesn’t do any
kind of long-term cognition. It inhabits the here and now.

We’re not like that, and we know it. Our mental processes are seldom
algorithmic, changing their states one step at a time. Thought involves
continual feedback and self-correction, and the individual components
cannot be teased apart. Mitchell writes:
The various subsystems involved are in constant dialogue with each other, each
attempting to satisfy its own constraints in the context of the dynamically
changing information it receives from all the interconnected areas.

He draws from the computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter the concept of
cognitive loops—recursive representations of other representations, with
feedback—from which arise the ability to think about thinking, to reason
about reasons.
These capabilities required more than just increased size or computing
power. As brains evolved, a convoluted processing hierarchy arose: “As the
cortical sheet expands, there is a tendency for existing areas to split into
two, creating new areas that can act as new levels of the processing
hierarchy.” These new levels are “capable of abstracting information and
thinking about new things.” We look out at the world, and we look in upon
ourselves with our mind’s eye. Not only do we develop goals and desires,
but we recognize them; we develop language for them; we talk about them
with our fellow creatures. We exercise free will, and we say so—because we
are social organisms, and culture, too, evolves.

In the present moment, it’s natural to ask whether an artificial intelligence
might develop any degree of free will or agency. Indeed, the question of
agency in AI systems may be more critical than the question of
consciousness. In an epilogue, Mitchell takes stock of the latest
developments in neural networks and large language models, noting that
their ability to generate text and respond to conversational prompts creates
an impression of knowledge, if not sentience. At the same time, the models’
limitations are well known. They are designed for specialized tasks, as
distinct from artificial general intelligence. They simulate human language
with astonishing skill, based on statistical pattern-finding in enormous
volumes of training data, but the text they generate is seldom tethered to
real-world meaning, and they often fail in novel situations. Understanding
of causal relations appears to be a weakness. Most starkly, however, they
are passive.
Agency is what distinguishes us from machines. For biological creatures,
reason and purpose come from acting in the world and experiencing the
consequences. Artificial intelligences—disembodied, strangers to blood,
sweat, and tears—have no occasion for that. If they have goals, the goals are
imposed by their creators. They don’t plan. They don’t strive. At least so far.

The psychology of believing in free will
Published: July 2, 2018 8.21pm AEST
Peter Gooding
PhD Candidate of Psychology, University of Essex

From coffee table books and social media to popular science lectures, it seems it has has become
increasing fashionable for neuroscientists, philosophers and other commentators to tell anyone that
will listen that free will is a myth.
But why is this debate relevant to anyone but a philosophy student keen to impress a potential date?
Actually, a growing body of evidence from psychology suggests belief in free will matters enormously
for our behaviour. It is also becoming clear that how we talk about free will affect whether we believe
in it.
In the lab, using deterministic arguments to undermine people’s belief in free will has led to a number
of negative outcomes including increased cheating and aggression. It has also been linked to a
reduction in helping behaviours and lowered feelings of gratitude.

The psychology of believing in free will

A recent study showed that it is possible to diminish people’s belief in free will by simply making them
read a science article suggesting that everything is predetermined. This made the participants’ less
willing to donate to charitable causes (compared to a control group). This was only observed in nonreligious participants, however.
Scientists argue that these outcomes may be the result of a diminished sense of agency and control
that comes with believing that we are free to make choices. Similarly, we may also feel less moral
responsibility for the outcomes of our actions.
It may therefore be unsurprising that some studies have shown that people who believe in free will are
more likely to have positive life outcomes – such as happiness, academic success and better work
performance . However, the relationship between free will belief and life outcomes may be complex so
this association is still debated.

Disturbing dualism
Language and definitions seem linked to whether we believe in free will. Those who refute the
existence of free will typically refer to a philosophical definition of free will as an ability of our
consciousness (or soul) to make any decision it chooses – regardless of brain processes or preceding
causal events. To undermine it, they often couple it with the “determinism” of classical physics.
Newton’s laws of physics simply don’t allow for free will to exist – once a physical system is set in
motion, it follows a completely predictable path.
According to fundamental physics, everything that happens in the universe is encoded in its initial
conditions. From the Big Bang onward, mechanical cause-and-effect interactions of atoms formed
stars, planets, life and eventually your DNA and your brain. It was inevitable. Your physical brain was
therefore always destined to process information exactly as does, so every decision that you are ever
going to make is predetermined. You (your consciousness) are a mere bystander – your brain is in
charge of you. Therefore you have no free will. This argument is known as determinism.
Descartes mind and body: Inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the epiphysis in the brain and
from there to the immaterial spirit. wikipedia

But this approach is absurdly dualistic, requiring people to see their consciousness as their true self
and their brain as something separate. Despite being an accurate description of the philosophical
definition of free will, this flies in the face of what ordinary people – and many scientists – actually
believe.
In reality it seems that the functioning of our brain actually affects our consciousness. Most of us can
recognise, without existential angst, that drinking alcohol, which impacts our physical brain,
subsequently diminishes our capacity to make rational choices in a manner that our consciousness is
powerless to simply override. In fact, we tend to be able to accept that our consciousness is the
product of our physical brain, which removes dualism. It is not that our brains make decisions for us,
rather we make our decisions with our brains.

The psychology of believing in free will

Most people define free will as simply their capacity to make choices that fulfil their desires – free
from constraints. This lay understanding of free will doesn’t really involve arguments about
deterministic causation stretching back to the Big Bang.
But how could we learn about the arguments for and against the existence of free will without feeling
threatened and having our moral judgement undermined? One way could be to re-express valid
deterministic arguments in language that people actually use.
For example, when the determinist argues that “cause-and-effect interactions since the Big Bang
fashioned the universe and your brain in a way that has made your every decision inevitable”, we
could replace it with more familiar language. For example, “your family inheritance and life
experience made you the person you are by forming your brain and mind”.
In my view, both arguments are equally deterministic – “family inheritance” is another way of saying
DNA while “life experiences” is a less challenging way of saying prior causal events. But, importantly,
the latter allows for a greater feeling of freedom, potentially reducing any possible negative impacts
on behaviour.

Quantum weirdness
Some even argue that the notion of scientific determinism is being challenged by the rise of quantum
mechanics, which governs the micro world of atoms and particles. According to quantum mechanics,
you cannot predict with certainty what route a particle will take to reach a target – even if you know
all its initial conditions. All you can do is to calculate a probability, which implies that nature is a lot
less predictable than we thought. In fact, it is only when you actually measure a particle’s path that it
“picks” a specific trajectory – until then it can take several routes at once.
While quantum effects such as these tend to disappear on the scale of people and everyday objects, it
has recently been shown that they may play a role in some biological processes, ranging from
photosynthesis to bird navigation. So far we have no evidence that they play any role in the human
brain – but, of course, that’s not to say they don’t.
People using a philosophical definition and classical physics may argue convincingly against the
existence of free will. However, they may want to note that modern physics does not necessarily agree
that free will is impossible.
Ultimately, whether free will exists or not may depend on your definition. If you wish to deny its
existence, you should do so responsibly by first defining the concepts clearly. And be aware that this
may affect your life a lot more than you think.

The Rise of the Uncertain
Uncertainty in physics has gone from black sheep to overachiever.

L

et me tell you a short, fictitious story about a very real Spanish conquistador, Francisco
de Orellana.

In 1546 he was captured and imprisoned in a small, dank cell. Before long he was summoned, and
a judge sentenced him to death. To add insult to injury, the judge decided a bit of mental torture
was in order. The sentence was passed on a Sunday, and the judge ordered that Orellana be
hanged by the end of the week—but also that he be told of the event only on the morning of his
execution. Each night, Orellana would fall asleep not knowing whether it would be his last.
But hang on a minute, thought Orellana (presumably maintaining his rationality in the face of
death). The execution could not take place on Friday because, if Orellana hadn’t been informed
by Thursday morning that he would be killed that very day, then he would need to be executed
the following day, giving him a full day’s foresight. The tortuous surprise would be missing.
Therefore he would be killed on Thursday at the latest.
But Thursday, too, was impossible, since if he hadn’t been told by Wednesday morning that he
would die that day, he would have the same full day’s notice. Following this line of thought,

Orellana concluded that Wednesday, Tuesday, and all the other days leading back to the Sunday
when his sentence was passed were equally unworkable appointments with the executioner.
Orellana concluded that he had deflected his torture by sheer dint of thought. The execution
could never come as a surprise!
This well-known puzzle, called the “hangman paradox,” has existed in many different variants for
years. To this day philosophers argue about where the catch lies. How could it be that so simple
an instruction as the judge’s fails? Is there a hidden assumption? A subtle break in logic? Is the
definition of the word surprise consistent throughout?

Indeterminism
At the heart of the hangman paradox is a tension between determinism and chance.
Determinism tells us simply that the very first moment of a history decides every other moment
up to the last. In the words of Persian poet and astronomer Omar Khayyam, “And the first
Morning of Creation wrote / What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.” Chance strips from us
control and foresight, like Orellana in the judge’s imagination.
Orellana feels that he has led determinism to a triumph over the uncertainty of the judge’s
sentence. But as we look more carefully at his victory, it starts to feel Pyrrhic. Objections arise.
We may believe intuitively that the judge’s orders do in fact amplify the horror of the death
sentence. The hangman paradox reflects the ambivalence of any deterministic claim.
And, indeed, most of us are probably already ambivalent about determinism. Psychologically we
are repelled by the possibility that all our actions are fully determined by our history and the
environment. In addition, our subjective experience of the world is full of randomness.

“And the first Morning of Creation wrote
What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.”
—Omar Khayyam
On the other hand, determinism is intellectually pleasing and has attracted the fealty of some of
our greatest thinkers. German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz developed it
into “the principle of sufficient reason,” the idea that everything happens for a reason. Dutch

philosopher Baruch Spinoza, a rationalist par excellence, used the principle of sufficient reason
to argue for a completely deterministic universe in which God is basically the sum total of all
causes. To Spinoza, the universe could be constructed only one way, allowing even God no
choice.
For the determinist, randomness is a kind of illusion, the result of our ignorance as humans.
Underneath that illusion lies a clockwork world. For a deep anti-determinist, the present and the
past of nature itself have an indeterminate relationship. Both determinist and anti-determinist,
then, would agree that randomness exists. But for the one, it is a human failing, and for the other,
a physical property.
And this is where the physicist enters the debate. As we will see, quantum physics offers an
interesting resolution to the determinism-randomness duality that is capable of embracing both
sides. It portrays determinism at the level of the whole universe, while allowing that any part of
the universe may be fundamentally random.

A brief uncertain history
Perhaps the scientific result most clearly in the determinist camp was Newton’s discovery of the
laws of motion. They allowed scientists to predict precisely the position of planets far into the
future. And given that every other object in the universe also followed those laws, all of existence
appeared to be eminently deterministic. The French physicist Pierre-Simon de Laplace reasoned
that a sufficiently powerful intelligence that could “comprehend all the forces by which nature is
animated” and knew the initial positions of every object could know everything from start to
finish: “… nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.”

The Rise of the Uncertain - Nautilus

Laplace’s worldview reigned for 200 years until German physicist Max Planck arrived on the
scene. Planck realized that the classical physics of Newton and his later peers was incomplete
and proved that energy always comes in tiny but discrete chunks called quanta. Fellow German
physicist Werner Heisenberg pointed out that the quantum picture brought with it a new kind of
uncertainty.
Imagine, he said, that we want to know the position and velocity of a single electron. To see it we
must bounce light off the electron and then detect the reflected light with a microscope. But
there is a problem: Light interacting with the electron will give it a push, so the position we see in
the microscope will no longer be accurate. To make matters worse, the push will impart a
random velocity to the electron, making both the position and velocity uncertain. Heisenberg
argued we can never know the position and velocity at the same time, no matter how sensitive
our tools.
Perhaps this is not surprising. As objects interact with each other in complex ways, you might
say, certain of their properties become uncertain. But even in the absence of direct interaction
uncertainty can be generated.
Suppose you take a number of electrons in exactly the same physical state. Now choose half of
them at random and measure their position, while measuring the velocity of the other half.
Physicists have found that the more precisely you measure the position of the first half, the less
precisely you are able to measure the momentum of the second half. Heisenberg’s uncertainty
again. But this time, there is no interaction between the two halves during the measurement.

And what’s more, this uncertainty correlation persists regardless of the distance between the
two halves, even at enormous expanses. The reactions in one half to measurements in the other
are instantaneous.

For the determinist, randomness is a human failing. For the anti-determinist, it
is a physical property.
This picture of the world really bugged Einstein, both because the communication of
information across large distances seemed to violate his theory of relativity and because he
objected to the idea that reality was deeply indeterminate. He argued that quantum mechanics
was incomplete and proposed a thought experiment to prove it. In his experiment, co-designed
with his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, two particles interact with each other in
such a way that their position and velocity become perfectly correlated. Measuring the position
of one would let us know the position of the other, and the same for their velocity.
But if we could determine the exact position and velocity of both particles, it would contradict
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (we’d measure one particle to determine its position and the
other to determine its velocity). And since quantum physics is based on Heisenberg, it must be
incomplete. This became known as the EPR paradox. (Subsequent experiments by Alain Aspect
and others have reconciled these troubling aspects of quantum mechanics, proving Einstein and
his colleagues wrong.)

Entangled Photon Preparation: Modern experiments usually prepare entangled photons using nonlinear crystals like beta barium borate
(BBO), shown in pale blue. Nonlinear crystals are able to generate two lower-energy outgoing photons (shown in red and blue) for every
incoming high-energy photon (which are often in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, shown in purple). This process is known as downconversion. Down-converted photons are entangled because they are polarized in the same direction (indicated by the blue and red arrows).
Once such photons are generated, they fly separate ways and are then measured to confirm entanglement.

Quantum correlations between objects and events like the ones we’ve described are called
entanglement. Quantum physics stipulates that all the objects in the universe that have
interacted have become entangled. Interaction simply means that objects, say atoms, share
information by exchanging other objects, say photons. More generally, anytime the properties of
one object are affected by another object, we say that they interact.
And pretty much all matter is entangled in some way. That’s because matter is constantly
interacting via light and other fields. What’s more, in its distant past, all matter interacted even
more intimately, given that the entire universe had (arguably) a volume smaller than 10-43 meters
cubed (at about 10-34 seconds after the Big Bang).
Physics, then, has taken us from the precisely determined worldview of Newton and Laplace to
the locally uncertain world of Heisenberg to the globally uncertain world of Aspect. If all matter
is entangled and interdependent, then our ability to know the properties of any part of our
universe depends on inscrutable connections to distant objects. This simple observation may be
the basis for a reconciliation between determinism and chance.

The origins of probabilities
To see how this works, we must first assume that the quantum physics we have studied in small
systems in the laboratory applies to the universe as a whole.

Does Quantum Mechanics Hold at Large Scales?: This may seem at first to be guaranteed—after all, don’t physical laws apply equally well at
all scales? There are, however, issues particular to quantum mechanics that have yet to be resolved. Gravity and quantum mechanics have not
been convincingly reconciled at large scales. In fact, Oxford physicist Roger Penrose thinks gravity may overwhelm the effects of quantum
mechanics at large scales. He points to the existence of black holes as proof: When something falls into a black hole it can never come out, which
is an example of an irreversible process. But the mathematics describing quantum physics are all reversible in time. So quantum physics has
trouble describing matter at the scale of a black hole. Artist’s view by NASA/ESA and G. Bacon

If so, the universe is in a gigantic entangled state. It becomes possible for the universe as a whole
to evolve completely deterministically, while individual parts of the universe maintain a nondeterministic uncertainty. From our limited perspective, in our corner of the universe, looking at
the little bits of matter we have access to and without knowledge of the relevant entanglements,
things would indeed appear uncertain. At the same time, from a perspective outside the universe
—from which everything is seen as a whole—they would not.
In this view, we live in a deterministic universe but cannot escape uncertainty. And entanglement
becomes an important source of uncertainty for our macroscopic lives. A coin toss, for example,
would be random for two sets of reasons. The first set is our own ignorance of the initial
conditions: Our hand is in an unexpected position, the velocity we give the coin is random, and
so on. But even if we corrected for each of these factors and made a toss under conditions that
appear identical, the outcome would still, in principle, be random because of a second,
https://nautil.us/the-rise-of-the-uncertain-234356/?_sp=b377e53c-e705-4ed6-b51a-abfcb2feebef.1742348727321

independent source of uncertainty: The coin, our hand, and everything else is linked to other
matter through entanglement. And the properties of that other matter are out of our control.
A more important consequence than random coin tosses is the uncertainty that is the basis of
the random DNA mutations necessary for evolution. A truly indeterminate local physics
guarantees that this process has some “noise,” and that mutation is always possible in principle.
The chemistry of DNA replication involves, after all, exchanges of electrons and atoms, which are
quantum objects.

We live in a deterministic universe but cannot escape uncertainty.
The deterministic universe fits into a broader picture that is emerging from modern physics as
being exquisitely balanced. The degree of a system’s disorder is measured as entropy, a quantity
that reflects how many different ways the parts of a system can be arranged to make the whole.
A perfectly deterministic universe has zero entropy, since there is only a single arrangement
possible (with future rearrangements determined entirely by fixed laws). If the universe is
deterministic, it has zero entropy. An increasing entanglement with the rest of the universe
balances our observation of increasing entropy (or disorder) in our part of the universe, in line
with the second law of thermodynamics. Because increasing entanglement correlates states with
each other, it drives entropy down. On the whole, entropy always stays at zero.
Recent measurements also suggest that the universe as a whole has zero energy, zero charge,
and zero angular momentum. How is this possible? All energy due to matter (which is positive) is
canceled by an equal amount of gravitational energy (which is negative). There are equal
amounts of positive and negative charge, and we cannot create one without creating the other.
Zero angular momentum means that the universe has no net spin. The universe, then, is a whole
lot of nothing: yin and yang that cancel each other out. Locally, in our own neighborhood, we
seem to have lots of stuff: matter, charges, motion, entropy, and uncertainty. But globally, none
of these exist, never have and never will.
This picture would please the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He claimed that nothing
begets nothing, meaning that something cannot be created out of nothing. Otherwise, he said,
anything could be created out of anything. This view is contrary to the official Vatican position
regarding cosmogony, but it is fully consistent with modern physics.

And determinism, with its zero entropy, fits nicely into this paradigm.
Gilbert Keith Chesterton believed that paradoxes have value because they are “truth standing on
its head to gain attention.” In our case, we have, like Orellana, reasoned our way to a place of
profound determinism. As in the hangman paradox, it coexists, albeit uncomfortably, with a
profound uncertainty.

Turtles All the Way Up | Jessica Riskin | The New York Review of Books

After spending most of the twentieth century watching birds, the
Harvard ornithologist and evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr
concluded that they were rote little machines. He wrote in 1988 that
birds and other animals are no more purposeful than computers: they
behave as they’re programmed to. If you’ve ever seen a bird, you might
find that surprising: they certainly look purposeful as they seek out
unsuspecting rodents to swoop down upon, ferry worms to their
irksome offspring, and produce miniature versions of the Beijing
Olympic stadium.
Even more remarkable than Mayr’s claim itself is the fact that it
purports to represent a scientific view of things. For one thing,
programmed by whom? Mayr’s answer was that birds and other
creatures were programmed by natural selection via genetics: natural
selection favors genetic “behavior program[s]” that maximize fitness,
for instance by ensuring an “instantaneous correct reaction to a
potential food source, to a potential enemy, or to a potential mate.”
Mayr didn’t justify his belief in behavior programs other than by
claiming that this was the only legitimate possibility: the alternatives
were “supernaturalistic.” He wasn’t even going to “waste time showing
how wrong” they were. Mayr’s genetic behavior program, in other
words, was axiomatic; we might call it a dogma.
Robert Sapolsky, a neuroscientiest and primatologist at Stanford,
carries the argument further in his new book, Determined: A Science of
Life Without Free Will. It’s not just other animals that are deterministic
machines, he says, but humans. Embracing a scientific worldview, for
Sapolsky, means accepting that there’s no free will. Every
development, including every action of living beings, follows
inexorably from the previous state of things: “We are nothing more or
less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over
which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment.” People
cling to their cherished idea of free will with “ferocious tenacity”
(presumably they can’t help themselves), but he hopes to shake their
faith.
Sapolsky is ecumenical about the causes determining human behavior.
Like Mayr, he considers evolution the underlying process—“humans
were sculpted by evolution over millions of years”—but he emphasizes
that long-term evolutionary processes are inseparable from short-term
causes, including neurons, genes, epigenetics, the womb, the
environment, ecology, hormones, smells, history, culture, “the sort of
people you come from,” and “how you were mothered within minutes
of birth.” No doubt there could be plenty more—economics, for
instance, or the obstetrical resident who handed you to your mother—
but anyhow the whole smorgasbord comes together to fix human
behavior absolutely, leaving “not a single crack of daylight” for agency
to sneak through. Not only are we “not captains of our ships,” he
writes, “our ships never had captains. Fuck. That really blows.” (This
gives a taste of Sapolsky’s late-night-dorm-room literary style.)

How does he know? Because of science. Sapolsky tells us that “the
science of human behavior shows” it to be deterministic. But none of
the scientific evidence he offers turns out to demonstrate this. He
describes psychological studies revealing changes in people’s
electroencephalograms (EEGs) taking place milliseconds before they
were aware of making a decision, but he dismisses these—reasonably
enough—as “irrelevant.” He presents other studies demonstrating that
people can be subconsciously manipulated; that hormones, cultural
beliefs, and moral values influence behavior; and that maturation,
aging, and experience induce alterations in people’s brains and bodies
with corresponding behavioral changes. After each discussion he asks,
“Does this disprove free will?” and responds—again reasonably—with
“nah,” “nope,” “certainly not,” and “obviously not.” Readers might
wonder, equally reasonably, why they’ve slogged through all this
irrelevant nonevidence.
It’s because the many factors influencing behavior, Sapolsky thinks,
place the burden of proof on defenders of human agency. It’s they who
need to show that neurons are “completely uninfluenced” by any
external factors and that “some behavior just happened out of thin
air.” But why must human behavior be either deterministic or
impervious to any influence? Sapolsky doesn’t explain; he takes as
given that to show any influence at all is to show a determining
influence. Similarly, he writes that we have “no control” over our
biology, culture, or environment. Sure, we don’t control these things,
but there’s an important difference between not controlling something
and having no effect on it, or at least so anyone with teenagers is
inclined to hope. Biology isn’t insulated from behavior any more than
behavior is from biology. As Sapolsky himself points out, virtually
everything a person does has an effect on their physiology. And a
wealth of empirical evidence from Aristotle to Oprah suggests that
people can indeed have cultural influence.
Sapolsky’s confidence is also unshaken by the various scientific fields
that study unpredictability, irreducibility, or indeterminacy in physical
systems. Chaos theory studies unpredictable systems, like the weather,
but unpredictable doesn’t necessarily mean indeterminate; complex
systems theory studies emergent phenomena that can’t be reduced to
their component parts, like traffic or slime molds, but Sapolsky says
these have no “centralized authority” capable of having a will1; and
quantum indeterminacy doesn’t “bubble up” to influence behavior.
Since unpredictability isn’t the same as indeterminacy, he’s also
unfazed by scientists’ lack of success in predicting human behavior,
and even cheerfully affirms that they’ll never be successful at it. That’s
no reason to doubt the “deterministic gears grinding underneath.”

—as hypothetical old women will—to personify stubborn unreason. In

James’s own version, it was actually a pile of rocks, not turtles, and he
never claimed to have met the woman himself: she was already a cliché
by the time he invoked her in 1882, a staple of American popular
writing on science and belief. She had appeared as early as the 1830s
in various literary reviews as a foil for writers pressing a modern,
Newtonian worldview.
The rocks became turtles after the English anthropologist Edward
Burnett Tylor published a comparison of “World-Tortoise”
cosmologies, including native North American and Indian versions, in
his books Researches into the Early History of Mankind (1865) and
Primitive Culture (1871), describing the course of cultural progress
from savagery to civilization. Following this cameo, the WorldTortoise came to epitomize backward belief systems, and some writers
began combining it with the older stack-of-rocks idea to get an infinite
regress of turtles.2 For instance, in 1905 a Christian Scientist in
Washington, D.C., offered examples of heathen ignorance including the
view of a fabricated “Richmond negro preacher” that the world stood
on “turtles all the way down.”
In a disarming twist, Sapolsky takes the old woman’s side. He might be
the world’s first actual believer in stacked turtles. Like the other
writers in this tradition, he casts worldviews other than his own as
preposterous—only now it’s those who don’t subscribe to stackedturtle-ism who are irrational. “It actually is much more ridiculous and
nonsensical,” he writes, “to believe that somewhere down there, there’s a
turtle floating in the air.” He characterizes ideas about human agency
as “magical,” “absurd,” “mystical gibberish,” “nonsense,” and full of
“fairy dust.”
Sapolsky’s turtles are of course metaphorical; they stand for
deterministic causes, and by “a turtle floating in the air” he means a
magical event. We must accept a strictly causal chain extending back
to the beginning of time or acknowledge that we believe in miracles.
But why are these our only choices? And are they really so different?
Wouldn’t a chain of deterministic causes imply a miracle of some sort
at the beginning—the old infinite regress problem rearing its domed
shell again?
This, in fact, was what determinism originally implied: an omnipotent,
divine creator behind the world-machine. Although it has a scientific
sound today, the idea of living beings as deterministic machines didn’t
originate with natural selection; it came into evolutionary biology by
way of a theological tradition of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, according to which the programmer was an omniscient
deity. The determinism of today’s devoted sect of scientists,
philosophers, and popular science writers—however incongruous it
might seem—grew out of a creed whose adherents believed in a
supernatural God with a monopoly on causal power.

he originator of modern scientific determinism was the French
mathematician, astronomer, physicist, and statesman Pierre-

Simon Laplace, who in 1814 wrote triumphantly that science had at
last eradicated the belief in miracles from the minds of “enlightened
men.” Each state of the universe, he announced, was fixed by the
previous one and determined the subsequent one.
A long tradition of denying miracles was already in place by then, but
it wasn’t a scientific tradition, at least in the first instance; the original
miracle deniers were Protestants. “Magicians and enchanters have
always been famous for miracles, and miracles of an astonishing
description have given support to idolatry,” warned John Calvin.
Rejecting floating turtles doesn’t necessarily make you a scientific
rationalist; in some contexts, it might mean you’re a Calvinist. So
might denying the existence of free will and claiming that every
human fate is predestined. In fact, here’s a quiz: Which of the
following passages are by Robert Sapolsky and which by John Calvin?
1. “The power of free will is not to be considered in any of those desires
which proceed more from instinct than mental deliberation.”
2. “From this it is erroneously inferred…that there is some power of free
will.”
3. “You are privileged…to cloak yourself with myths of freely willed
choices.”
4. “Whatever happens in the universe was destined to happen.”
(Answers at end of article)

Laplace’s starting point was Isaac Newton, who in the 1713 second
edition of his Principia proclaimed “that the true God is a Living,
Intelligent and Powerful Being…. He is Eternal and Infinite,
Omnipotent and Omniscient.” God controlled everything in Newton’s
universe. All its parts were God’s “Creatures subordinate to him, and
subservient to his Will.” In the words of Newton’s friend and
translator, the Anglican philosopher Samuel Clarke, the world
operated “by the continual uninterrupted exercise of [God’s] power
and government,” and there were “no powers of nature at all that can
do anything of themselves.” Newton’s world-machinery functioned
only through God’s immediate presence in each part and would
otherwise grind to a halt.
Nicknamed the “French Newton” by the popular press, Laplace
showed Newtonian tendencies not only in his system of celestial
mechanics but also in some of the theological ideas he attached to it.
In his cosmology, as in Newton’s, nothing enjoyed its own power to
act. Laplace extended his strict determinism even to minor and
insignificant events, which he said resulted from the law-governed

order of things “as necessarily as the revolutions of the sun,” and to
apparent acts of will and free choice, which were nothing but
“illusion[s] of the mind.”
Laplace imagined an infinite intelligence that could comprehend all
the interacting forces in the universe. For such a being nothing would
be uncertain, “and the future, as the past, would be present to its
eyes.” The human mind could gain but a “feeble idea” of such an
intelligence. The closest we could come, Laplace thought, was through
astronomy and mathematics, which would lead the mind “back
continually to the vast intelligence…from which it will always remain
infinitely removed.”
This suggestion of an omniscient being might seem surprising coming
from Laplace, who is often invoked as an early champion of atheism.
But while he left behind the Catholic orthodoxy in which he grew up,
he consistently expressed belief in a supreme power behind natural
processes, referring to a divine intelligence in his published writings
and to God in private letters. According to an often told story,
Napoleon asked Laplace why he made no mention of God in his work
on celestial mechanics, and Laplace replied that he had “no need of
that hypothesis.” The anecdote, a favorite of popular science writers,
seems to have originated with Napoleon’s doctor François Carlo
Antommarchi. But the astronomer William Herschel, who witnessed
the exchange, said Laplace merely meant that “a chain of natural
causes” could account for the “wonderful system” of the heavens.
God’s existence wasn’t in question.
This is consistent with what Laplace himself wrote: the supreme
intelligence might have worked entirely through material causes, with
no need for direct supernatural action of the sort Newton invoked. If
Laplace said he had no need of a particular theological hypothesis, it
was likely Newton’s idea of constant divine intervention in nature that
he rejected, not God’s presence behind the world-machine. In fact,
Laplace boasted about his own findings regarding the stability of the
solar system that if Newton could have known of them, they would
have confirmed his belief in a providential Creator.
In short, the deterministic mechanism of the world, in Laplace’s
science, was the manifestation of an omnipotent force: a total
consolidation of power. It left no room for contingency, uncertainty, or
even minor assertions of choice or will, which were all figments of
human ignorance, illusion, and folly. Early in his book, Sapolsky says
he won’t be considering “theologically based Judeo-Christian views”
about free will and determinism, yet his own view has deep roots in a
form of Judeo-Christian absolutism.
Sapolsky tells the story of Phineas Gage, who suffered a metal rod
through the brain while working on a construction site in Vermont in
1848 and was never quite the same afterward. He offers Gage as

evidence that people’s personalities depend on their “material brains,”
which he thinks poses a challenge to anyone who wants to defend the
idea of free will. But why should the fact that humans and their brains
are made of material parts mean there’s no such thing as human
agency? There’s a good answer, but it’s historical rather than scientific:
because determinism retains crucial elements of the theology from
which it arose, according to which the material world was a passive
artifact lacking any agency of its own.

L

ike scientific determinism more generally, the idea of living beings
as rote machines also originated in an older theological tradition:

the argument from design. Authors of arguments from design said they
could prove the existence of God by showing that natural things,
especially living ones, were complex machines and must therefore
have a designer. The tradition originated in the mid-seventeenth
century, but William Paley, an Anglican philosopher and Christian
apologist, gave the idea its most familiar expression in his book
Natural Theology (1802), a huge best seller. Paley said living things
revealed the existence of God the way a watch reveals the existence of
a watchmaker. “In crossing a heath,” he wrote, “suppose I pitched my
foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there.”
He might reply that it could have been there forever. “But suppose I
had found a watch upon the ground.” Aha! He could hardly give the
same answer; someone must have made the watch and left it there.
People found this argument irresistibly persuasive. But is a living thing
really like a watch? They’re both complex systems of interacting parts.
But what if the watch had yelped and scuttled away, as many living
things will do when you trip over them? Paley’s argument relied on a
peculiar notion of living things as passive, inert. It might seem strange
that Mayr, a twentieth-century biologist, shared this counterintuitive
idea of living beings with Paley, an eighteenth-century theologian. But
stranger yet, modern biology largely absorbed Paley’s model of
organisms.
It wasn’t so much Charles Darwin himself who absorbed it, although
he was deeply marked by Paley’s work, which he studied at Cambridge.
“In order to pass the B.A. examination,” he later recalled, “it was…
necessary to get up Paley’s Evidences of Christianity…. I am convinced
that I could have written out the whole of the Evidences with perfect
correctness.” One indication of the impression Paley made was
Darwin’s inner struggle regarding the workings of the eye. Comparing
eyes to lens instruments was a staple of arguments from design. You
can’t have a lens instrument without an instrument maker, went the
reasoning—a microscope doesn’t put itself together from parts—and
likewise, you can’t have an eye without a divine optician. Paley wrote
that eyes were “so exquisite in their contrivance” that on their own
they constituted proof that could “never be got rid of.” Darwin

certainly had trouble getting rid of it. “The eye to this day gives me a
cold shudder,” he confessed to his friend and ally, the Harvard botanist
Asa Gray.
Yet Darwin did manage to distinguish eyes from artificial optical
devices. He based his evolutionary explanation of the eye on an active
capacity specific to living things: the sensitivity of the optic nerve to
light. The eye, he said, began as a sensitive optic nerve beneath a layer
of transparent tissue, then formed gradually over “millions on millions
of years” through natural selection. Still, Darwin allowed a bit of Paley
to seep in: he described natural selection as
a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the
transparent layers; and carefully selecting each alteration which…may in
any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a distincter image.

Such passages led both Gray and another friend, the geologist Charles
Lyell, to feel that Darwin was “deifying” natural selection.
Despite such seemingly deistic moments in his writings, Darwin took a
great interest in the capacity of animals to be their own creators,
transforming themselves, one another, and their environment, and so
influencing the course of evolution. An example is his idea of “use and
disuse”: animals strengthen and enhance their body parts by using
them, or weaken them by declining to use them, then pass these
changes on to their offspring. Another example is his theory of sexual
selection, in which animals shape their descendants by choosing mates
according to their various standards of beauty. Darwin also became
less religious over the course of his life. In his autobiography, intended
only for family and close friends, he called himself an “Agnostic” and
wrote that his “disbelief” in the Christian faith and a personal God
had come upon him gradually “but was at last complete.”
After Darwin’s death, however, his most influential followers insisted
on the passivity of organisms at the hands of natural selection, and
ultimately at the hands of a divine presence behind evolution. In effect,
these neo-Darwinian evolutionary theorists imported the absolute
power of God into the determining force of natural selection. The
principal author of this revised Darwinism was August Weismann, a
doctor and zoology professor at the University of Freiburg. Weismann
rejected Darwin’s theory of use and disuse, insisting that organisms
could never pass on to their offspring any of the changes they
underwent in their lifetimes. He also assured his readers that his
science assumed a “Universal Cause” or “Final Cause” operating
“behind” the mechanism of the universe and was therefore “absolutely
opposed” to materialism. All “directive power” lay with this remote
divine presence and none with the evolving beings themselves.

This interpretation rendered living beings not just powerless to
influence the course of evolution but passive even at the level of
behavior. One of Weismann’s followers was the ornithologist Erwin
Stresemann, who was also Mayr’s mentor at the University of Berlin
during the 1920s. In Stresemann’s view, “An animal does not act for
itself, but under a higher commission: animal non agit, sed agitur [an
animal does not act, but is acted upon].” Mayr learned Weismannism
at his mentor’s knee. The idea that animals were passive machines,
having come to him in the doctoral equivalent of his mother’s milk,
remained so powerful that almost a century of experience in
ornithology—including extensive research on birds learning from
experience, exhibiting spatial and temporal intelligence, constructing
and using tools, communicating through song, and understanding
abstract concepts such as “same” and “different”—did nothing to
shake it. Several decades on, if Sapolsky’s latest book is any indication,
the dogma seems stronger than ever.

S

apolsky has a humanitarian purpose: he wants us not to blame
anyone for anything they’ve done, since they had no choice.

Accordingly he advocates reforming the criminal justice system to
eliminate retributive punishment. A handful of philosophers and
neuroscientists have made the same argument, and Sapolsky cites
them, but he doesn’t mention the extensive literature that rejects
retributive theories without treating humans as deterministic. In the
eighteenth century, for instance, the Italian criminologist Cesare
Beccaria wrote that the purpose of punishment should never be “to
torment a sensible being,” which was useless and inconsistent with
justice, but should solely be to prevent further crimes in whatever way
would cause the least distress to the criminal. Or, as the twentiethcentury English legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart put it, no moral alchemy
can transmute the imposition of suffering into good. You don’t need to
deny that criminals have free will to oppose retribution as a goal of
criminal justice.
In fact, you might think that treating criminals humanely means
acknowledging that they retain a fundamental human agency. The
English philosopher P.F. Strawson wrote that if we give up a sense of
agency in other people, we lose any basis for feelings of love, gratitude,
affection, respect, or esteem. Others have placed the recognition of
personhood and agency at the crux of humanitarian thinking.
According to the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, fostering
human agency should be the core purpose of economic development.
He writes that it would be “a very restricted view of…personhood” to
see people simply “as entities that experience and have well-being.”
Instead we must see people “as responsible persons: not only are we
well or ill, but also we act or refuse to act, and can choose to act one
way rather than another.”

Sapolsky’s solution to the problem of what to do with those convicted
of crimes is radically at odds with this definition of humanitarian
policy. He recommends that society regard them as the passive objects
of their fate and commit them to a medical-style “quarantine.” He
gives few details, but does mention a familiar array of practices, from
physically confining people to requiring them to register with the local
police and wear tracking bracelets. It’s hard to see how this would be
better than, or even very different from, being punished in the existing
system.
Although Sapolsky doesn’t consider the arguments that medical
models of criminal justice objectify and dehumanize people, he does
acknowledge a problem many have raised: quarantines, unlike most
prison sentences, are of indefinite duration. Who gets to decide when
they end? He seems unconcerned about the totalitarian risks of a
system of indefinite imprisonment, writing that the constraining
measures would always be the minimum necessary for public safety.
And anyway, don’t worry, once people realize there’s no free will, they
won’t “be recoiling from this constrained person as a loathsome,
blameworthy criminal anymore,” so the constraints will be imposed
with a smile.3
Sapolsky, like others who favor criminal justice reform, admires
Norway’s prison system, in which prisoners live in residences that
resemble college dorms and enjoy a great deal of freedom to move
around, pursue various kinds of projects, and live their lives as
normally as possible. It’s a commendable system, but a bad example
for Sapolsky, since it’s founded on a principle of enhancing prisoners’
agency. Are Høidal, the founding warden of Halden, Norway’s model
maximum-security prison, says the goal is to promote prisoners’
“freedom of choice” and foster people’s “own efforts to change their
criminal behavioral patterns.”
Finally, unsurprisingly, Sapolsky’s reductive model of human beings
carries the same implications as others of its kind. It relegates people
to categories by class, biology, and cultural stereotype: the college
graduate versus the garbage collector, those with one “flavor” of genes
versus those with another, the person from “individualist” America
versus the person from a “collectivist” East Asian culture that
emphasizes “conformity.” Sapolsky is careful to stress that no single
factor—genetic, environmental, cultural, familial—determines these
categories, but he’s equally emphatic that the sum of factors fixes them
utterly: the garbage collector can’t help but be a garbage collector, nor
the conformist East Asian person a conformist. Sapolsky speaks this
“incredibly important point” ex cathedra in the name of science, even
though, “yeah, no single result or scientific discipline” demonstrates it:
“Put all the scientific results together, from all the relevant scientific
disciplines, and there’s no room for free will.” Now, is that scientific? To
claim that lots of failures to prove something add up to a definitive
proof?

Science can’t prove there’s no free will because the question of free
will is not a scientific question but a philosophical one. To
misrepresent it as a scientific question is a prime example of scientism
—extending the claims of science beyond its bounds. Here’s another
from Sapolsky’s final chapter: “What the science in this book
ultimately teaches is that there is no meaning.” This might sound like
the opposite of saying that science shows there’s a divine intelligence
behind the world-machine, but it’s the direct descendant of that earlier
claim, and comes to the same evacuation of meaning and agency from
the mortal world. This isn’t a scientific proposition. It remains what it
has been from the beginning: a theology.

T

he first giant tortoise that Darwin saw when he traveled to the
Galapagos Islands with the HMS Beagle in autumn 1835 was

eating a piece of cactus; it stared at him and “stalked away,” while a
second one hissed and drew in its head. Fascinated by the enormous,
ancient creatures, he followed them and studied their habits. “The
tortoise is very fond of water,” he reported, “drinking large quantities,
and wallowing in the mud.” Darwin was especially impressed by the
tortoises’ ability to travel great distances from the lower parts of the
island up to the fresh water sources. They traveled “by night and day,”
and could journey eight miles in just two or three days. They created
“broad and well-beaten paths,” which were what had led the first
Spanish colonists to the watering holes. Upon arriving at the springs,
he beheld a “curious spectacle”: “Many of these huge creatures, one
set eagerly travelling onwards with outstretched necks, and another
set returning, after having drunk their fill.”
In this as in Darwin’s other observations, he describes living beings
behaving with purpose, agency, and meaning; indeed, reclaiming those
capacities from a divine creator. It’s turtles all the way up.

Here’s why

Social media algorithms, artificial intelligence, and our own genetics are among the factors
influencing us beyond our awareness. This raises an ancient question: do we have control over our
own lives? This article is part of The Conversation’s series on the science of free will.

Suppose you are thinking about doing something trivial, such as moving your index finger a little to
the right. You are free to do it. You are free not to do it. You weigh up the pros and cons, and decide to
do it. Lo and behold, your finger moves. Congratulations! You did it.
This is a case of free will. Clearly it’s not a momentous case. Nothing much depends on whether you
move your finger.
But imagine if something did. Imagine someone would be executed if you did move that finger. Then
you’d be morally responsible, because you did it freely.

It seems as obvious as anything that we have free will. But lots of philosophers and scientists will tell
you free will doesn’t exist.
The starting point of this argument is that free will is incompatible with determinism, a worldview
that dominated science in the past and remains influential today.

Is everything predetermined?
Determinism says everything that happens now is entirely determined by factors that were in place
well before you were even born.
Maybe these factors concern your upbringing or culture. Or they concern the initial conditions of the
Universe and the laws that govern how it unfolds. Either way, you had nothing to do with them. And if
they determine what you do, you aren’t free.
US philosopher Peter van Inwagen provides a vivid illustration of this argument, in his book An Essay
on Free Will. If determinism is true, the laws of nature and the past together guarantee you will move
your finger. It therefore follows that if you have the power not to move your finger, you would also
have the power to change the laws or the past.
But that’s ridiculous. You don’t have such powers.
An initial reaction is that, while determinism was important historically, it now seems false.
Quantum physics shows the occurrence of some events to be literally random. It’s a concept the
Australian National University used to develop a random number generator.
Unfortunately, this only makes matters worse. If moving your finger were just a random act, you
wouldn’t be responsible for it and so you still wouldn’t be free.

We might not be able to understand free will with science. Here’s why

This gives us the full-blown argument against free will. Either determinism is true or it’s not; that’s
just logic.
If determinism is true, your acts are a consequence of things that happened before you were born; so
you have no free will. But suppose determinism is not true; then it’s easy to think everything would be
random, including all your actions (such as raising your finger!). But in this instance, there would be
no free will either.
You might side with British philosopher Galen Strawson who, in his book Things That Bother Me,
argues free will is “provably impossible”.

Is there a middle ground?
Another option is to try to understand free will so it works with a limited form of determinism, that
applies to your actions rather than to everything in the world.
One version of this view, developed by ANU’s Victoria McGeer, involves defining free will as whatever
explains our social capacities to hold each other morally responsible. As a deterministic process could
in principle do that, free will and determinism may coexist.
But while a deterministic process may explain these capacities, it would not in that case be free will,
because free will is fundamentally incompatible with determinism.
At this point, things look bleak. But there is a small ray of light, pointed out by US linguist and
philosopher Noam Chomsky, who says:

We just can’t abandon believing it (free will); it’s our most immediate phenomenologically
obvious impression, but we can’t explain it. […] If it’s something we know to be true and we
don’t have any explanation for it, well, too bad for any explanatory possibilities.

We might not be able to understand free will with science. Here’s why

Noam Chomsky on free will.

Suppose again that determinism is incompatible with free will. If so, when you freely moved your
finger, that event was not fully determined by the initial conditions of the Universe and the laws of
nature.
Does it necessarily follow that it’s random? On the face of it, no. To be random is one thing; to be not
fully determined is quite another. There’s a logical space between determinism and randomness, and
perhaps free will lives in that space.
Chomsky goes on to say it may be impossible for humans to understand free will. In science, people
develop models or theories of the systems they are interested in. He suggests in his book Language
and Problems of Knowledge the only models we can understand are those in which our acts are either
determined or random. If so, we will never develop scientific models of free will, for it is neither of
these things.
I am not sure Chomsky is right about the limits of human understanding. But I think he’s right about
free will. We are free to move our finger. That is neither determined nor random — it’s a choice we can
feel in our bones.

What Happens to a Society That Does Not
Believe in Free Wıll?

What happens to a society that believes people have no conscious control
over their actions?

BY AZIM F. SHARIFF & KATHLEEN D. VOHS
June 2014 Issue

Behavior

In July 2008 retired steelworker Brian Thomas and his wife, Christine,
drove their camper van to a small seaside village in Wales. Disturbed by men
on motorbikes performing loud stunts, the couple relocated to the parking
lot of a nearby inn. Later that night Thomas dreamed that one of the bikers
had broken into the van. As he slept, he confused his wife with the
imaginary biker and strangled her to death. That is how he told the story,
anyway.
The next year a jury had to decide whether Thomas was guilty of murder.
He had been prone to sleepwalking since childhood, the jury learned. An
expert psychiatrist explained that Thomas was not aware of what he was
doing when he choked his wife and that he had not consciously chosen to
attack her. Thomas went free.
Such cases force people to consider what it means to have free will. During
sleepwalking the brain clearly can direct people's actions without engaging
their full conscious cooperation. Recently an increasing number of
philosophers and neuroscientists have argued that—based on a current
understanding of the human brain—we are all in a way sleepwalking all the
time. Instead of being the intentional authors of our lives, we are simply

pushed around by past events and by the behind-the-scenes machinations of
our unconscious minds. Even when we are wide awake, free will is just an
illusion.
Philosophers with this viewpoint argue that all organisms are bound by the
physical laws of a universe wherein every action is the result of previous
events. Human beings are organisms. Thus, human behavior results from a
complex sequence of cause and effect that is completely out of our control.
The universe simply does not allow for free will. Recent neuroscience
studies have added fuel to that notion by suggesting that the experience of
conscious choice is the outcome of the underlying neural processes that
produce human action, not the cause of them. Our brains decide everything
we do without “our” help—it just feels like we have a say.
Not everyone agrees, of course, and debates over the existence of free will
continue to rage. The two of us, however, are intrigued by a related question
of equal importance: What happens when people's belief in free will—
justified or not—is shaken? What does a post–free will society, or rather a
post–belief in free will society, look like? Our research into this issue offers
inklings of an answer, some of which are disturbing. In particular, we see
signs that a lack of belief in free will may end up tearing social organization
apart.
Exoneration for Criminals
Some of our experiments have, however, hinted at a more benign outcome,
implying that a society that abandoned its belief in free will would be less
punitive than our world is today. In survey research, we found that the more
people doubt free will, the less they favor “retributive” punishment—
punishment meted out not primarily to deter future crime but rather to
make individuals suffer for their transgressions. Yet what people believed
about free will did not diminish support for “consequentialist” punishment,
which abandons the notion of comeuppance and focuses instead on the most

effective ways to discourage crime and rehabilitate perpetrators. In effect,
free will skeptics treat people who break the law as they would viruses,
raging floods or other natural phenomena: they want to protect themselves
against further harm but have no desire to seek vengeance.
A subsequent investigation reached a similar conclusion. Half of our
participants read a book excerpt arguing that a rational view of human
beings leaves no room for free will. The other half read a passage from the
same book that was unrelated to free will. As we expected, the first group
became more doubtful of free will's existence. All the participants
subsequently read a story about a hypothetical man convicted for killing
someone in a bar fight. The story made it clear that imprisonment would
not help reform him. Those who had been exposed to arguments against
free will recommended half as much time in prison as did volunteers in the
other group.
In follow-up experiments, we discovered that it was not even necessary to
explicitly mention free will to change the way people think about it and,
consequently, how they decide appropriate punishment for a crime. After
reading glossy popular science magazine articles describing the neural
mechanisms that underlie human actions—with no overt mention of free
will—people viewed an imaginary criminal as less culpable than did
volunteers who were not exposed to such materials. Participants who read
about brain science also recommended about half the prison time for
murder. Learning about the brain in a college class appears to have similar
effects. A recent experiment by Lisa G. Aspinwall of the University of Utah
and her colleagues adds to this line of evidence. They showed that when a
mental disorder of a supposed criminal is explained in scientific language as
something that essentially takes over a person's brain, judges are especially
likely to give a supposed criminal a shorter prison sentence.

Social Disorder
Although increased leniency as a result of doubting free will might be a good
thing in many instances, completely abandoning criminal punishment
would be disastrous. Such punishment is vital to a well-functioning society.
Experimental research by Bettina Rockenbach of the University of Cologne
in Germany has shown that although few people like the abstract idea of
belonging to a group that punishes its members for wrongdoing, in practice
they overwhelmingly prefer it. Rockenbach and her colleagues asked
volunteers to play cooperative games and gave them the choice between
joining a group that either could or could not punish its members for failing
to help out. Initially only a third of the participants chose to join the group
that could penalize its members, but after 30 rounds nearly all of them had
switched over to the punishing group. Why? Because these experiments
confirmed what human societies have found over and over again throughout
history: when laws are not established and enforced, people have little
motivation to work together for a greater good. Instead they put themselves
above everyone else and shirk all responsibility, lying, cheating and stealing
their way to societal collapse.
Free will skepticism can be dangerous even to a society that has laws,
however. Some of our research reveals that such doubt, which weakens a
sense of accountability for one's actions, encourages people to abandon
existing rules. In studies conducted with Jonathan W. Schooler of the
University of California, Santa Barbara, participants who read an anti–free
will passage cheated on an academic test—electing to peek at the answers—
50 percent more than participants who read a neutral passage. Moreover, in
another study where participants were paid for each test question they
answered correctly, those who read anti–free will statements claimed they
had answered more questions correctly, and accepted payment accordingly,
than did other participants.

Equally disturbing for social cohesion, diminished belief in free will also
seems to release urges to harm others. One of the admittedly odd ways that
psychologists measure aggression in the laboratory is by giving people the
opportunity to add hot sauce or salsa to a snack that they know will be
served to someone who hates spicy food. Roy F. Baumeister of Florida State
University and his colleagues asked a group of volunteers to read arguments
for or against the existence of free will before preparing plates of tortilla
chips and clearly labeled hot salsa for another volunteer who had rebuffed
each group member earlier, refusing to work together with that person.
This same aloof individual, the subjects knew full well, was not a fan of
spiciness, and the person would have to eat everything that was handed out.
Those who had read texts doubting free will's existence used nearly double
the amount of salsa.
Neuroscience has revealed that at least one way skepticism about free will
erodes ethical behavior is by weakening willpower. Before people make a
motion—such as reaching for a cup—a particular pattern of electrical
activity known as readiness potential occurs in the brain's motor cortex,
which helps to regulate movement. By placing electrodes on the scalp,
Davide Rigoni of the University of Padua in Italy and his colleagues showed
that diminishing people's belief in free will decreased this electrical activity.
In a follow-up study, people whose free will beliefs had been weakened were
less able to inhibit impulsive reactions during a computerized test of
willpower. The less we believe in free will, it seems, the less strength we
have to restrain ourselves from the urge to lie, cheat, steal and feed hot sauce
to rude people.
New Justice
If neuroscience research continues to degrade people's belief that they have
free will, how will society change?

We see three possibilities. History is replete with examples of moral norms
evolving with new knowledge of the world. In his recent book The Better
Angels of Our Nature, Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker
documents a “humanitarian revolution” over the past 300 years in which
previously institutionalized practices such as slavery and cruel and unusual
punishment became widely reviled as morally abhorrent. Pinker credits the
change, in part, to the expanded knowledge of different cultures and human
behavior afforded by the Enlightenment's massive increase in literacy,
learning and information exchange.
New research unveiling the biological machinery behind human thought
and action may prompt a similarly dramatic change in moral views. This is
the first possibility. As they have before, changes in moral sentiments may
actually help improve the U.S.'s penal system. Currently, criminal
punishment is driven primarily by eye-for-an-eye retribution—the kind of
punishment favored by people who believe in free will—and, perhaps as a
result, is woefully ineffective at deterring future crime. Society should stop
punishing people solely for the sake of seeing them suffer and instead focus
on the most effective ways to prevent criminal activity and turn past
lawbreakers into productive citizens—strategies that become more
appealing when people question the reality of free will. Though
uncomfortable at times, doubting free will may end up as a kind of growing
pain for our society, aligning our moral intuitions and legal institutions with
new scientific knowledge and making us stronger than before.
It may not happen that way, though. As our research has suggested, the
more people doubt free will, the more lenient they become toward those
accused of crimes and the more willing they are to break the rules
themselves and harm others to get what they want. Thus, the second
possibility is that newfound skepticism of free will may end up threatening
the humanitarian revolution, potentially culminating in anarchy.

More likely is the third possibility. In the 18th century Voltaire famously
asserted that if God did not exist, we would need to invent him because the
idea of God is so vital to keeping law and order in society. Given that a belief
in free will restrains people from engaging in the kind of wrongdoing that
could unravel an ordered society, the parallel is obvious. What will our
society do if it finds itself without the concept of free will? It may well
reinvent it.

Behavior

One fall night I lay awake wondering how I should begin this essay. I
imagined a variety of ways I could write the first sentence and the next and
the one after that. Then I thought about how I could tie those sentences to
the following paragraph and the rest of the article. The pros and cons of
each of those options circled back and forth in my head, keeping me from
drifting off to sleep. As this was happening, neurons were buzzing away in
my brain. Indeed, that neural activity explains why I imagined these options,
and it explains why I am writing these very words. It also explains why I
have free will.
Increasingly, neuroscientists, psychologists and pundits say that I am wrong.
Invoking a number of widely cited neuroscientific studies, they claim that
unconscious processes drove me to select the words I ultimately wrote.
Their arguments suggest our conscious deliberation and decisions happen
only after neural gears below the level of our conscious awareness have
already determined what we will choose. And they conclude that because
“our brains make us do it”—choosing for us one option over another—free
will is nothing more than an illusion.
The experiments most often cited to show that our brains take charge
behind the scenes were carried out by the late Benjamin Libet in the 1980s at
the University of California, San Francisco. There he instructed study
participants outfitted with electrodes on their heads to flick their wrists
whenever they felt like it. The electrodes detected fluctuations in electrical
activity called readiness potentials that occurred about half a second before
people made the flicking motion. But participants became aware of their
intentions to move only about a quarter of a second before the movement,

leading to the conclusion that their brains had decided before they became
aware of what had happened. In essence, unconscious brain processes were
in the driver’s seat.
More recent studies using functional MRI have suggested the unconscious
roots of our decisions begin even earlier. In research published in 2013,
neuroscientist John-Dylan Haynes of the Bernstein Center for
Computational Neuroscience Berlin and his colleagues had volunteers
decide whether to add or subtract two numbers while in the fMRI scanner.
They found patterns of neural activity that were predictive of whether
subjects would choose to add or subtract that occurred four seconds before
those subjects were aware of making the choice.
These studies—and others like them—have led to sweeping
pronouncements that free will is dead. “Our decisions are predetermined
unconsciously a long time before our consciousness kicks in,” Haynes
commented to New Scientist, adding that “it seems that the brain is making
the decision before the person.” Others share his opinion. Evolutionary
biologist Jerry Coyne has written: “So it is with all of our ... choices: not one
of them results from a free and conscious decision on our part. There is no
freedom of choice, no free will.” Neuroscientist Sam Harris has concluded
from these findings that we are “biochemical puppets”: “If we were to detect
[people’s] conscious choices on a brain scanner seconds before they were
aware of them ... this would directly challenge their status as conscious
agents in control of their inner lives. ”
But does the research really show that all our conscious deliberation and
planning is just a by-product of unconscious brain activity, having no effect
on what we do later on? No, it does not. There are several reasons to think
that those who insist that free will is a mirage are misguided.

I call those who contend that science shows that free will is an illusion
“willusionists.” There are many reasons to be wary of the willusionists’
arguments. First, neuroscience currently lacks the technical sophistication to
determine whether neural activity underlying our imagining and evaluating
of future options has any impact on which option we then carry out
minutes, hours or days later. Instead the research discussed by willusionists
fails to clearly define the border between conscious and unconscious actions.
Consider the Libet experiment. It began with study participants preparing
consciously to make a series of repetitive and unplanned actions. When the
experiment began, they flexed their wrists when a desire arose
spontaneously. The neural activity involved in the conscious planning
presumably influenced the later unconscious initiation of movements,
revealing an interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.
Similarly, the 2011 Haynes study, in which people randomly picked whether
to add or subtract over the course of many trials, fails to provide convincing
evidence against free will. Early brain activity that occurred four seconds
before participants were aware of making a choice may be an indication of
unconscious biases toward one choice or the other.
But this early brain activity predicted a choice with an accuracy only 10
percent better than random chance. Brain activity cannot, in general, settle
our choices four seconds before we act, because we can react to changes in
our situation in less time than that. If we could not, we would all have died
in car crashes by now! Unconscious neural activity, however, can prepare us
to take an action by cuing us to consciously monitor our actions to let us
adjust our behavior as it occurs.
Willusionists also point to psychological research showing that we have less
conscious control over our actions than we think. It is true that we are often
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-have-free-will/

influenced unknowingly by subtle features of our environment and by
emotional or cognitive biases. Until we understand them, we are not free to
try to counteract them. This is one reason I think we have less free will than
many people tend to believe. But there is a big difference between less and
none at all.
The Libet and Haynes research deals with choices that people make without
conscious deliberation at the time of action. Everyone performs repetitive or
habitual behaviors, sometimes quite sophisticated ones that do not require
much thought because the behaviors have been learned. You put your key in
the lock. A shortstop dives for a ground ball. A pianist becomes immersed in
playing Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata.
The reflexive turning of the key, the lunging for the ball, or the depressing
of the white and black keys requires a particular type of mental processing.
What I was doing on that sleepless night—conscious consideration of
alternative options—is a wholly different activity from engaging in
practiced routines. A body of psychological research shows that conscious,
purposeful processing of our thoughts likely does make a difference in what
we do.
This work indicates that intentions we formulate to carry out specific tasks
in particular circumstances—what psychologists call “implementation
intentions”—increase the likelihood that we will complete the planned
behavior. A study performed by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer of New York
University and his colleagues revealed that dieters who consciously formed
an intention to ignore thoughts about tempting foods whenever they came
to mind then ate less of those foods than those dieters who simply set the
goal to lose weight.
Psychologist Roy F. Baumeister, then at Florida State University, and his
colleagues demonstrated that conscious reasoning improves performance on

logical and linguistic tasks and that it helps in learning from past mistakes
and overriding impulsive behaviors. In addition, the late Walter Mischel of
Columbia University found that our ability to willfully distract ourselves
from a temptation is crucial for self-control.
Every one of us carries out actions every day that we have consciously
planned for ourselves. It is possible that the neural activity that carries out
this planning has no effect on what we do or that it just concocts stories
after the fact to explain to ourselves and others what we did. But that would
make little evolutionary sense. The brain makes up only 2 percent of the
human body’s weight but consumes 20 percent of its energy. There would be
strong evolutionary pressure against neural processes that enable intricate
conscious thought yet are irrelevant to our behavior. The brain circuits
responsible for my imagining that this is the best way to write this essay are
likely causing it to turn out this way.

FREE WILL IN THE BRAIN?
Willusionists, however, suggest brain processing responsible for conscious
thinking simply cannot count as free will. They often say that people who
believe in free will must be “dualists” who are convinced that the mind
somehow exists as a nonphysical entity, separate from the brain. “Free will is
the idea that we make choices and have thoughts independent of anything
remotely resembling a physical process,” wrote neuroscientist Read
Montague in 2008. And Coyne has claimed that “true ‘free will’ ... would
require us to step outside of our brain’s structure and modify how it works.”
It is true that some people think of free will in this way. But there is no good
reason to do so. Most philosophical theories develop a view of free will that
is consistent with a scientific understanding of human nature. And despite
willusionists’ claims, studies suggest most people accept that we can have
free will even if our mental activity is carried out entirely by brain activity. If

most people are not committed to a dualist view about free will, then it is a
mistake to tell them that free will is an illusion based on the scientific view
that dualism is false.
One way to test people’s assumptions about free will is to describe the
possibility of brain-imaging technology that would allow perfect prediction
of actions based on information about prior brain activity. In fact, Harris has
suggested this scenario “would expose this feeling [of free will] for what it is:
an illusion.”
To see whether people’s belief in free will would be challenged by the
knowledge that the brain is engaged in unconscious information processing
that predicts behavior, Jason Shepard of Life University in Georgia, Shane
Reuter, then at Washington University in St. Louis, and I performed a series
of experiments in which we presented people with detailed scenarios
describing futuristic brain-imaging technology, as posited by Harris.
Hundreds of students at Georgia State University participated in the studies.
They read about a woman named Jill who, in the distant future, wore a
brain-imaging cap for a month. Using information from the brain scanner,
neuroscientists predicted everything she thought and did, even when she
tried to fool the system. The scenario concluded that “these experiments
confirm that all human mental activity just is brain activity such that
everything that any human thinks or does could be predicted ahead of time
based on their earlier brain activity.”
More than 80 percent of the participants reported that they believed that
such future technology was possible, yet 87 percent of them responded that
Jill still had free will. They were also asked whether the existence of such
technology would indicate that individuals lack free will. Roughly 75
percent disagreed. Further results showed that a significant majority felt that
as long as the technology did not allow people’s brains to be manipulated

such that their decisions could be controlled by others, they would have free
will and be morally responsible for their behavior.
Most participants in the experiments seem to think that the hypothetical
brain scanner is just recording the brain activity that is Jill’s conscious
reasoning and consideration about what to decide. Rather than taking this
to mean that Jill’s brain is making her do something—and that she has no
free will—they may just be thinking that the brain scanner is simply
detecting how free will works in the brain.
Why, then, do willusionists believe the opposite? It may have to do with the
current state of knowledge. Until neuroscience is able to explain
consciousness—which will require a theory to explain how our mind is
neither reducible to nor distinct from the workings of our brain—it is
tempting to think, as the willusionists seem to, that if the brain does it all,
there is nothing left for the conscious mind to do.
As neuroscience advances and imaging technology improves, these
developments should help reveal more precisely how much conscious
control we have and to what extent our actions are governed by processes
beyond our control. Finding resolutions for these questions about free will is
important. Our legal system—and the moral basis for many of our society’s
institutions—requires a better understanding of when people are, and are
not, responsible for what they do.

Social media algorithms, artificial intelligence, and our own genetics are among the factors
influencing us beyond our awareness. This raises an ancient question: do we have control over our
own lives? This article is part of The Conversation’s series on the science of free will.

In 1983, American physiologist Benjamin Libet conducted an experiment that became a landmark in
the field of cognitive sciences. It got psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers either very
excited or very concerned.
The study itself was simple. Participants were connected to an apparatus that measured their brain
and muscle activity, and were asked to do two basic things. First, they had to flex their wrist whenever
they felt like doing so.

Second, they had to note the time when they first became aware of their intention to flex their wrist.
They did this by remembering the position of a revolving dot on a clock face. The brain activity Libet
was interested in was the “readiness potential”, which is known to ramp up before movements are
executed.
Libet then compared the three measures in time: the muscle movement, the brain activity, and the
reported time of the conscious intention to move. He found both the reported intention to move and
the brain activity came before the actual movement, so no surprises there. But crucially, he also found
brain activity preceded the reported intention to move by around half a second.
This seemed to suggest participants’ brains had already “decided” to move, half a second before they
felt consciously aware of it.
In Libet’s experiments, participants had to remember where the dot was at the time they made the
conscious decision to flex their wrist. Tesseract2/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA

Had neuroscience just solved the free will problem?
Some researchers have since argued that the intuitive idea that we have a consciousness (or a “self”)
that is distinct from our brains — and that can cause things in the real world — might be wrong.
Really being the “author” of our actions seemed to suggest, at least for many people, that an “I” is
making the decisions, not the brain. However, only brains (or neurons) can really cause us to do
things, so should we be surprised to find that an intention is a consequence rather than the origin of
brain activity?
Others were less convinced of Libet’s study and have attacked it from all possible angles. For example,
it has been questioned whether flexing the wrist is really a decision, as there is no alternative action,
and whether we can really judge the moment of our intention so precisely. Perhaps, sceptics
suggested, the findings could be a lot of fuss about nothing.
But Libet’s findings have been successfully replicated. By using other neuroimaging methods such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with clever new analysis techniques, it
has been shown that the outcome of decisions between two alternatives can be predicted [several
seconds before the reported conscious intention].
Even Libet himself did not seem comfortable claiming our “will” does not matter at all. What if we
could still say “no” to what the brain wants to do? This would at least give us a “free won’t”. To test
this, one study asked participants to play a game against a computer that was trained to predict their
intentions from their brain activity. The research found participants could cancel their actions if the
computer found out quickly what they intended to do, at least up to around 200 milliseconds before
the action, after which it was too late.
But is the decision not to do something really so different from a decision to do something?

It depends what you mean by free

Will I or won’t I? Scientists still haven’t figured out free will, but they’re having fun trying

Another way to look at Libet’s study is to recognise it might not be as closely related to the “free will”
problem as initially thought. We might be mistaken in what we think a truly free decision is. We often
think “free will” means: could I have chosen otherwise? In theory, the answer might be no — being
transported back in time, and placed into exactly the same circumstances, the outcome of our decision
might necessarily be exactly the same. But maybe that doesn’t matter, because what we really mean is:
was there no external factor that forced my decision, and did I freely choose to do it? And the answer
to that might still be yes.
If you are worried about “free will” just because sometimes there are external factors present that
influence us, think about this: there are also always factors inside of us that influence us, from which
we can never fully escape — our previous decisions, our memories, desires, wishes and goals, all of
which are represented in the brain.
Some people might still maintain that only if nothing influences our decision at all can we be really
free. But then there is really no good reason to choose either way, and the outcome might just be due
to the random activity of neurons that happen to be active at the time of decision-making. And this
means our decisions would also be random rather than “willed”, and that would seem even less free to
us.
There are always things influencing us that are beyond our control. Victoriano Izquierdo/Unsplash, CC
BY

Most of our decisions require planning because they are more complex than the “spontaneous”
decisions investigated in Libet-style studies, like whether to buy a car, or get married, which are what
we really care about. And interestingly, we don’t tend to question whether we have free will when
making such complex decisions, even though they require a lot more brain activity.
If the emerging brain activity reflects the decision process rather than the outcome, we might not even
have a philosophical contradiction on our hands. It matters a lot what we call “the decision” — is it the
moment we reach an outcome, or the entire process that leads to reaching it? Brain activity in Libetstyle studies might simply reflect the latter, and that suddenly does not sound so mysterious anymore.

Where to from here?
While Libet’s classic study might not have solved the problem of free will, it made a lot of clever
people think hard. Generations of students have argued long nights over beer and pizza whether they
have free will or not, and researchers have conducted increasingly innovative studies to follow in
Libet’s footsteps.
Exciting questions have arisen, such as which brain processes lead to the formation of a voluntary
action, how we perceive agency, what freedom of will means for being responsible for our actions, and
how we change our mind after making an initial decision.

Researchers had to acknowledge they might not be able to provide a definite answer to the big
philosophical question. But the field of cognitive neuroscience and voluntary decisions is more alive,
interesting and sophisticated than ever before, thanks to the bold attempts by Libet and his successors
to tackle this philosophical problem using science.

t’s not just in politics where otherwise smart people consistently talk past one another.
People debating whether humans have free will also have this tendency. Neuroscientist
and free-will skeptic Sam Harris has dueled philosopher and free-will defender Daniel

Dennett for years and once invited him onto his podcast with the express purpose of finally
having a meeting of minds. Whoosh! They flew right past each other yet again.
Christian List, a philosopher at the London School of Economics who specializes in how humans
make decisions, has a new book, Why Free Will Is Real, that tries to bridge the gap. List is one of
a youngish generation of thinkers, such as cosmologist Sean Carroll and philosopher Jenann
Ismael, who dissolve the old dichotomies on free will and think that a nuanced reading of physics
poses no contradiction for it.
List accepts the skeptics’ definition of free will as a genuine openness to our decisions, and he
agrees this seems to be at odds with the clockwork universe of fundamental physics and
neurobiology. But he argues that fundamental physics and neurobiology are only part of the
story of human behavior. You may be a big bunch of atoms governed by the mechanical laws, but
you are not just any bunch of atoms. You are an intricately structured bunch of atoms, and your
behavior depends not just on the laws that govern the individual atoms but on the way those

atoms are assembled. At a higher level of description, your decisions can be truly open. When
you walk into a store and choose between Android and Apple, the outcome is not preordained.
It really is on you.

BOOK OF DANIEL: “When I read Daniel Dennett’s books, I found them very persuasive,” says Christian List (above). “I began to see little gaps or
instances of imprecision. I decided a more thorough and systematic defense of free will against some of the skeptical challenges is
needed.” Courtesy of Harvard University Press

Skeptics miss this point, List argues, because they rely on loose intuitions about causation. They
look for the causes of our actions in the basic laws of physics, yet the concept of cause does not
even exist at that level, according to the broader theory of causation developed by computer
scientist Judea Pearl and others. Causation is a higher-level concept. This theory is fully
compatible with the view that humans and other agents are causal forces in the world. List’s

book may not settle the debate—what could, after thousands of years?—but it will at least force
skeptics to get more sophisticated in their own reasoning.
These questions are not abstract. They underlie the justice system and our day in, day out
judgments about praise and blame. It is hard to think about human beings without assuming we
are not the author of our own decisions. But the practical need for assuming free will is not an
argument in itself.
Earlier this month, List spoke with me from his office in London, and I soon found myself wishing
I could take one of his philosophy classes. He laid out the issues step by step and stayed clear of
the jargon and rabbit holes into which many philosophers fall.

What really struck me about the book is you give a fair presentation of the case you’re going to
argue against. I wish more academics did that. So what is the argument against free will?
A free-will skeptic argues, first, that free will requires one or more properties: intentional, goaldirected agency; alternative possibilities—that it must be possible for me to do otherwise; or
causal control over our actions. Then the skeptic claims that those properties are not to be
found among the fundamental physical features of our world. Different skeptics focus on
different properties.
For instance, some neuroscientists and philosophers such as Patricia and Paul Churchland say
we should understand human behavior not so much at the cognitive, psychological level where
we invoke explicit mental states, goals, intentions, and purposes, but rather at a lower level of
description, as the product of biophysical processes in the brain. Human beings have a strong
tendency to ascribe intentions to all sorts of phenomena, like the weather, natural disasters, or
rivers. We no longer do that. As brain science becomes more advanced, we may dispose with
ascriptions of intentionality even to human beings.

If we are searching for free will at the fundamental physical level, we are simply
searching in the wrong place.
The second line of argument says, if the universe is deterministic, as at least some of our best
physical theories suggest, then there is no room for alternative possibilities to choose from.
Determinism is the thesis that if we fix the complete state of the universe at a particular point in

time, only one future trajectory of states is possible. If we fix the state of the world at the time of
the Big Bang or shortly after, the entire sequence of events thereafter would be inexorably fixed.
When you go to a café and you ask yourself, “Should I have a coffee or a tea?” it would be
already written into the initial state of the world which of those two choices you’re going to
make.
The third line of argument is that, when I raise a water glass in order to drink from it, it’s not
really my intentional mental state that causes this action. Rather, it’s some underlying,
subconscious, sub-intentional physical process in the brain. Benjamin Libet found that the
conscious decision to press a button is not the beginning of the causal sequence that initiates
the process, but there is first a certain pattern of unconscious or subconscious brain activity,
and he interpreted this as a challenge for free will.
These arguments have considerable force. One way to respond would be to water down the
notion of free will so that one or several of the properties I’ve mentioned are not required. For
instance, maybe it’s good enough for free will that I endorse my action and it’s not necessary
that I could have done otherwise. Or maybe we must redefine what we mean by alternative
possibilities. It might be that I was always going to choose coffee rather than tea, but if
hypothetically the world had been a little bit different, I would have made a different choice.
But that’s not a strategy that I find attractive. I am quite happy to concede that free will requires
intentional agency, alternative possibilities among which we can choose, and causation of our
actions by our mental states. I think the mistake in the standard arguments against free will lies in
a failure to distinguish between different levels of description. If we are searching for free will at
the fundamental physical level, we are simply searching in the wrong place.

Let’s go through these arguments one by one. What do you say to those who consider the idea
that humans are beings with goals and intentions, and that we act on them, a prescientific
holdover?
If you try to make sense of human behavior, not just in ordinary life but also in the sciences, then
the ascription of intentionality is indispensable. It’s infeasible and not illuminating to explain
human behavior at the level of astronomically complex neural firing patterns that take place in
the brain.

Suppose I ask a taxi driver to take me to Paddington Station. Twenty-five minutes later, I’m there.
The next day, I tell the driver to take me to St. Pancras Station. Now the driver takes me to St.
Pancras. If I look at the underlying microphysical activity, it would be very difficult to pinpoint
what those two events have in common. If we switch to the intentional mode of explanation, we
can very easily explain why the taxi driver takes me to Paddington on the first day, and what the
difference is on the second day that leads the driver to take me to St. Pancras Station. The taxi
driver understands our communication, forms the intention to take me to a particular station,
and is clearly incentivized to do so because this is the way for the driver to earn a living.
The neuroscientific skeptic is absolutely right that, at the fundamental physical level, there is no
such thing as intentional goal-directed agency. The mistake is to claim that there is no such thing
at all. Intentional agency is an emergent higher-level property, but it is no less real for that.
Whenever our best scientific explanations of a particular phenomenon commit us to postulating
certain entities or properties, then it is very good scientific practice to treat those postulated
entities or properties as genuinely real. We observe patterns and regularities in our social and
human environment, and the best way to make sense of those patterns and regularities is by
assigning intentional agency to the people involved.

What about the second argument, the challenge from determinism—that, before I walk into a
café, it is preordained what I will order?
The jury is out on whether the world is fundamentally deterministic—it depends on how we
interpret quantum mechanics—but suppose it is. This does not necessitate that the world is also
deterministic at some higher level of description. Indeterminism at the level of psychology is
required for free will and alternative possibilities. That is entirely compatible with determinism at
the fundamental physical level.
Think about weather forecasting. Meteorologists are interested in higher-level patterns and
regularities. In fact, the very notion of weather is a higher-level notion. At the level of individual
air molecules, there is no such thing as weather. Perhaps the system at that very fine-grained
level of description would indeed behave deterministically according to classical physical laws,
but as you move to a more macroscopic description, you abstract away from this microphysical
detail. That is not driven by ignorance on our part, but by the explanatory need to focus on the
most salient regularities.

It’s infeasible to explain human behavior at the level of complex neural firing
patterns in the brain.
When you consider the macroscopic weather states, the system is not deterministic, but
stochastic, or random. We can attach probabilities to different scenarios, but it’s not the case
that the weather state at the present time fully determines the weather state in a few days’ time.
Multiple different trajectories are entirely possible.
Likewise, to describe the complete state of a human agent, we do not describe the full
microphysical state of every elementary particle in the brain and body. That would be the wrong
level of description. If our best theories of human agency compel us to postulate forks in the
road between which agents can choose, then we’ve got very good scientific reasons to take
alternative possibilities at face value. If you ask psychologists, cognitive scientists, and
economists, they will give you different theories of how human choice-making works. But they all
treat human beings as agents who are faced with choices between different options, so all these
theories assume alternative possibilities.

Wait, I’m not sure I want indeterminism at the human level. I want my decisions to flow out of my
deliberations, not to be the product of chance.
This is subtle. There are different forms of indeterminism. In statistical physics, indeterminism is
associated with randomness. But in the social sciences, we use a different kind of indeterminism
based on option availability. In decision theory, we draw a distinction between the options an
agent could choose and the option the agent will in fact choose, based on maximizing expected
utility or some other criteria. If I’m rational, I’m going to try to systematically make choices that
are in line with my beliefs and preferences and goals. But the other options don’t disappear. They
are available to me right up to the moment of my choice.

A common theme I’m sensing in your arguments is that we should take the lessons of our
scientific theories seriously—all our theories. If physics says the microscopic world is
deterministic, we should accept that, at least provisionally until some better theory comes along.
If psychology says humans have genuine choices, we should accept that, too.
Yes. It would not be very principled to say that fundamental physics is deterministic based on
what our best theories of fundamental physics say, while rejecting that weather systems, for

example, are indeterministic based on what our best theories of meteorology say. Provided our
best theories in higher-level sciences are well confirmed, we have good scientific reasons to take
them just as seriously as we’re taking our fundamental physical theories.

Let’s move on to argument number three, that we have causal control over our own acts.
If we accept my response to the first challenge that we human beings are intentional, goaldirected agents, we might still worry that our goals don’t play a causal role. We need to define
what we mean by causation. Neuroskeptical arguments against free will invoke causal notions,
but often they don’t spell out precisely what they mean.
In the sciences, we test for causation by looking for systematic correlations that remain in place
even when we control for other factors. The way in which causal modelers now tend to think
about causation—in fields such as statistics, computer science, probability theory, and the
philosophy of mind—captures this aspect of scientific methodology. This approach is called the
interventionist theory of causation. To say one particular variable causes another is to say that, if
we were to intervene on the first variable by changing its value, we would bring about a change
in the other variable.

There is no conceptual reason why sophisticated AI systems could not qualify
as bearers of free will.
Let’s say I now form the intention to move my arm to lift this glass to drink some water. What
should we cite as the cause of this particular arm movement? My intentional mental state—
namely, my intention to drink—is very systematically associated with my actions. If my mental
state changes, my resulting actions change as well. By contrast, not every change or variation in
the underlying physical states would give rise to a change in the resulting act.
A leading philosopher whose work I hugely admire, Jaegwon Kim, raised an important challenge
against mental causation, the so-called causal exclusion argument. If you consider a particular
effect and you’ve found a cause that fully accounts for that effect, you should not
simultaneously postulate yet another distinct cause for the same effect. That would be an act of
causal overattribution. Let’s suppose, once again, I lift my arm to drink some water. You can fully
account for the action by reference to the physical state of my brain, so there is no reason to
postulate yet another cause—namely, a distinct mental cause.

My response, which Peter Menzies and I developed, is that if we accept the interventionist
theory of causation, the causal exclusion argument does not generally hold. For any given
system, the most systematic causal relations may not involve the lowest-level variables, but could
involve higher-level variables, or there might be systematic causal relations at both levels.

Let me see whether I follow, using the taxi metaphor. You have two switches. One is a simple
binary Paddington-St. Pancras switch. The other is an analog dial, and you have to fine-tune it to
set the destination. It might be set to Paddington, but a slight nudge changes it to St. Pancras,
and another nudge changes it back to Paddington—it’s very sensitive. The binary switch is a
more effective means of controlling the outcome. It is analogous to seeking a mental cause
rather than an atomic one.
That’s spot-on.

What do your views on free will imply? Do machines or even corporations have free will?
In my joint work with Philip Petit, I’ve argued that organized collectives can be intentional agents
in their own right, over and above their individual members. Commercial corporations would be
examples, if suitably organized. Those group agents don’t have the same cognitive capacities that
you and I have, but nonetheless we might say that they have a certain form of free will.
Something similar can be said about AI systems as well. One can have long debates about
whether current AI systems are sufficiently advanced, but there is no conceptual reason why
sophisticated AI systems could not qualify as bearers of free will. Much like corporate agents,
which we also think should be held responsible for their actions, AI systems ideally should display
a certain form of moral agency and not just rigid goal-seeking behavior in the interest of profit
or whatever else their objective function might be. As we employ more and more AI systems in
high-stakes settings, we would like those systems to make ethically acceptable decisions.

Yes, Free Will Exists | Scientific American

Opinion

This article was published in Scientific American’s former blog network and reflects
the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American

At least since the Enlightenment, in the 18th century, one of the most
central questions of human existence has been whether we have free will. In
the late 20th century, some thought neuroscience had settled the question.
However, as it has recently become clear, such was not the case. The elusive
answer is nonetheless foundational to our moral codes, criminal justice
system, religions and even to the very meaning of life itself—for if every
event of life is merely the predictable outcome of mechanical laws, one may
question the point of it all.
But before we ask ourselves whether we have free will, we must understand
what exactly we mean by it. A common and straightforward view is that, if
our choices are predetermined, then we don’t have free will; otherwise we
do. Yet, upon more careful reflection, this view proves surprisingly
inappropriate.
To see why, notice first that the prefix “pre” in “predetermined choice” is
entirely redundant. Not only are all predetermined choices determined by
definition, all determined choices can be regarded as predetermined as well:
they always result from dispositions or necessities that precede them.
Therefore, what we are really asking is simply whether our choices are
determined.
In this context, a free-willed choice would be an undetermined one. But
what is an undetermined choice? It can only be a random one, for anything
https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/yes-free-will-exists/

2/7

23/03/2025, 22:09

Yes, Free Will Exists | Scientific American

that isn’t fundamentally random reflects some underlying disposition or
necessity that determines it. There is no semantic space between
determinism and randomness that could accommodate choices that are
neither. This is a simple but important point, for we often think—
incoherently—of free-willed choices as neither determined nor random.
Our very notion of randomness is already nebulous and ambiguous to begin
with. Operationally, we say that a process is random if we can’t discern a
pattern in it. However, a truly random process can, in principle, produce any
pattern by mere chance. The probability of this happening may be small, but
it isn’t zero. So, when we say that a process is random, we are merely
acknowledging our ignorance of its potential underlying causal basis. As
such, an appeal to randomness doesn’t suffice to define free will.
Moreover, even if it did, when we think of free will we don’t think of mere
randomness. Free choices aren’t erratic ones, are they? Neither are they
undetermined:if I believe that I make free choices, it is because I feel that my
choices are determined by me. A free choice is one determined by my
preferences, likes, dislikes, character, etc., as opposed to someone else’s or
other external forces.
But if our choices are always determined anyway, what does it mean to talk
of free will in the first place? If you think about it carefully, the answer is
self-evident: we have free will if our choices are determined by that which we
experientially identify with. I identify with my tastes and preferences—as
consciously felt by me—in the sense that I regard them as expressions of
myself. My choices are thus free insofar as they are determined by these felt
tastes and preferences.
Why, then, do we think that metaphysical materialism—the notion that our
choices are determined by neurophysiological activity in our own brain—
contradicts free will? Because, try as we might, we don’t experientially identify
https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/yes-free-will-exists/

3/7

23/03/2025, 22:09

Yes, Free Will Exists | Scientific American

with neurophysiology; not even our own. As far as our conscious life is
concerned, the neurophysiological activity in our brain is merely an
abstraction. All we are directly and concretely acquainted with are our fears,
desires, inclinations, etc., as experienced—that is, our felt volitional states. So,
we identify with these, not with networks of firing neurons inside our skull.
The alleged identity between neurophysiology and felt volition is merely a
conceptual—not an experiential—one.
The key issue here is one that permeates the entire metaphysics of
materialism: all we ever truly have are the contents of consciousness, which
philosophers call “phenomenality.”’ Our entire life is a stream of felt and
perceived phenomenality. That this phenomenality somehow arises from
something material, outside consciousness—such as networks of firing
neurons—is a theoretical inference, not a lived reality; it’s a narrative we
create and buy into on the basis of conceptual reasoning, not something felt.
That’s why, for the life of us, we can’t truly identify with it.
So, the question of free will boils down to one of metaphysics: are our felt
volitional states reducible to something outside and independent of
consciousness? If so, there cannot be free will, for we can only identify with
contents of consciousness. But if, instead, neurophysiology is merely how
our felt volitional states present themselves to observation from an outside
perspective—that is, if neurophysiology is merely the image of conscious
willing, not its cause or source—then we do have free will; for in the latter
case, our choices are determined by volitional states we intuitively regard as
expressions of ourselves.
Crucially, the question of metaphysics can be legitimately broached in a way
that inverts the usual free will equation: according to 19th-century
philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, it is the laws of nature that arise from a
transpersonal will, not the will from the laws of nature. Felt volitional states
are the irreducible foundation of both mind and world. Although

Schopenhauer’s views are often woefully misunderstood and misrepresented
—most conspicuously by presumed experts—when correctly construed they
offer a coherent scheme for reconciling free will with seemingly
deterministic natural laws.
As elucidated in my concise new book, Decoding Schopenhauer’s Metaphysics,
for Schopenhauer the inner essence of everything is conscious volition—
that is, will. Nature is dynamic because its underlying volitional states
provide the impetus required for events to unfold. Like his predecessor
Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer thought of what we call the “physical world”
as merely an image, a perceptual representation of the world in the mind of
an observer. But this representation isn’twhat the world is like in itself,
prior to being represented.
Since the information we have about the external environment seems to be
limited to perceptual representations, Kant considered the world-in-itself
unknowable. Schopenhauer, however, argued that we canlearn something
about it not only through the sense organs, but also through introspection.
His argument goes as follows: even in the absence of all self-perception
mediated by the sense organs, we would still experience our own
endogenous, felt volition.
Therefore, prior to being represented we areessentially will. Our physical
body is merely how our will presents itself to an external vantage point. And
since both our body and the rest of the world appear in representation as
matter, Schopenhauer inferred that the rest of the world, just like ourselves,
is also essentially will.
In Schopenhauer’s illuminating view of reality, the will is indeed free
becauseit is all there ultimately is. Yet, its image is nature’s seemingly
deterministic laws, which reflect the instinctual inner consistency of the
will. Today, over 200d years after he first published his groundbreaking

ideas, Schopenhauer’s work can reconcile our innate intuition of free will
with modern scientific determinism.

Yes, We Have Free Will. No, We Absolutely Do Not
A volley of new insights reignites the debate over whether our choices are ever truly our own.

Y

ou’re thirsty so you reach for a glass of water. It’s either a freely chosen action or the
inevitable result of the laws of nature, depending on who you ask. Do we have free will?
The question is ancient—and vexing. Everyone seems to have pondered it, and many

seem quite certain of the answer, which is typically either “yes” or “absolutely not.”
One scientist in the “absolutely not” camp is Robert Sapolsky. In his new book, Determined: A

Science of Life Without Free Will, the primatologist and Stanford professor of neurology spells
out why we can’t possibly have free will. Why do we behave one way and not another? Why do
we choose Brand A over Brand B, or vote for Candidate X over Candidate Y? Not because we
have free will, but because every act and thought are the product of “cumulative biological and
environmental luck.”
Sapolsky tells readers that the “biology over which you had no control, interacting with the
environment over which you had no control, made you you.” That is to say, “everything in your
childhood, starting with how you were mothered within minutes of birth, was influenced by
culture, which means as well by the centuries of ecological factors that influenced what kind of
culture your ancestors invented, and by the evolutionary pressures that molded the species you
belong to.”

Sapolsky brings the same combination of earthy directness and literary flourish that marked his
earlier books, including Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, about the biology of stress, to this latest
work. To summarize his point of view in Determined, he writes, “Or as Maria sings in The Sound

of Music, ‘Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could.’”
The affable, bushy-bearded Sapolsky is now in his mid 60s. During our recent interview over
Zoom, I was on the lookout for any inconsistency; anything that might suggest that deep down
he admits we really do make decisions, as many of us surely feel. But he was prepared and stuck
to his guns.

I had no issue with the first part of his argument—that cultural, genetic, and environmental
factors influence our lives, and nudge us in certain directions. But how could those factors
dictate what we say or do in each moment? He turned the question back on me.
“Why do you value that question?” he said. “Why did you wind up being a person who would be
interviewing somebody about this subject? That wouldn’t have happened, for instance, if you had
been raised with intestinal parasites in the middle of Niger.”

Your life is nothing but that: everything that came before.
To most people, Sapolsky said, free will is apparent in real time, for every action you perform.
“You ask, ‘Did you intend to do it? Did you realize you could have done something else? That you
had options?’ Most people’s intuitive sense is the answers are yes, and so you have demonstrated
free will. But that’s like trying to evaluate a movie by only seeing the last three minutes of it.
When you ask, ‘Where did intent come from?’, everything from one second to a million years
before comes into play. That leads inevitably to the conclusion that there’s no free will. Because
no matter how much you try, you can’t intend to intend something. You can’t will yourself to
have willpower. You can’t think of what you’re going to think of next. It’s simply not possible.”
The way Sapolsky sees it, you can’t escape the biological and cultural forces and environmental
factors that preceded you and shaped you. “There’s not a crack anywhere in there to shoehorn
in free will,” he said. “When you look at every contemporary argument for free will that’s not
invoking God or fairy dust or something, at some point, one must assume a step that bypasses
the antecedent causes. But that violates the laws of how neurons work, atoms work, and
universes work. Your life is nothing but that: everything that came before.”

any scientists and philosophers beg to differ. Prominent among them is Kevin Mitchell,
a neuroscientist at Trinity College in Dublin. In his new book, Free Agents: How

Evolution Gave Us Free Will, Mitchell argues that although we’re shaped by our biology,

it’s that very biology that made us, over the course of billions of years of evolution, into free
agents. Even the earliest and most primitive creatures had some capacity to control their
destinies. When a single-celled organism moves toward a food source, or away from danger, it
has entered, however meekly, into a new world of agency and freedom. Simple organisms,
Mitchell writes, “infer what is out in the world” and “make holistic decisions to adapt their

internal dynamics and select appropriate actions.” He adds: “This represents a wholly different
type of causation from anything seen before in the universe.”
A dozen years younger than Sapolsky, and with a less voluminous beard, Mitchell was born near
Philadelphia but grew up in Ireland; he then returned to the United States for grad school and a
postdoc, before heading back to Dublin. That accounts for his “all over the place” accent, he told
me.

In a universe where the mindless laws of nature push bits of matter around, it might indeed
seem miraculous that free will—agency—can emerge. As I made my way through Free Agents, I
thought of a New Yorker cartoon where two scientists are at a blackboard filled with equations.
In the middle, instead of an equation, the first scientist has written, “Then a miracle occurs.” The
second guy says to him, “I think you should be more explicit here in step two.”
But emerge it does, according to Mitchell, and he’s adamant that there is nothing miraculous
about it. Rather, in living creatures like us, freedom is enabled by the underlying biology.
But couldn’t biology itself be beyond our control? In their books, both Sapolsky and Mitchell
refer to the work of neuroscientist Benjamin Libet. In the 1980s, Libet conducted a series of
experiments that appeared to show that electrical activity in the brain could be detected several
hundred milliseconds before the subject became aware of making a decision—suggesting, to
some, that the brain itself must be doing the “deciding,” with the conscious mind following along
after the fact. Libet’s experiments were, and remain, controversial; even so, they left many
people wondering if free will must be an illusion.
Mitchell doesn’t buy it. Yes, there are physical and chemical processes operating within the brain
—how could there not be?—but that does nothing to take away our freedom, he says. “It comes
down to the idea that if we can find the machinery inside the brain that is active when we’re
making a decision, then maybe decision making just is being done causally by that machinery,” he
told me. “I don’t think that view is right, because I think you can have a completely different view,
which is, yes, there is some machinery that we use to make decisions; but it’s machinery we use
to make decisions. We’re making the decisions.”
For Mitchell, decision-making did not start with human beings. Rather, it can be traced back to
the first simple organisms that flourished hundreds of millions or even billions of years ago. “I
wanted to take an evolutionary approach to this problem,” he said.

This represents a wholly different type of causation.
Evolution, Mitchell said, favors organisms that have some ability to make their way in the world.
“They need to know what’s out in the world, and what to do about it.” Creatures evolved the
ability to sense, and the ability to act, based on those sensations. They were evaluating (in some

primitive manner) which action was likely to prolong their survival. “Even bacteria do this,”
Mitchell said. Humans merely do this in a more sophisticated manner.
“We see what’s out in the world, gauge our internal state—bacteria do that too—and, given
those things, given my beliefs about the world, and my own state at the moment, and my goals,
we ask, ‘What should I do? What’s my range of options? How can I choose one of them and
inhibit all the others?’”
Over the course of evolution, creatures with more sophisticated decision-making abilities
appeared. “Those capacities got more elaborate, and more sophisticated, which led to
organisms with greater and greater agency, with more control,” Mitchell said. “They have a
greater range of possible actions; they have more flexible behavior.”
As creatures evolved more sophisticated ways to respond to their environments, they began to
plan over longer time-scales. “They have a cognitive horizon that gets broader and broader
through evolution,” Mitchell said. “And that means that they have greater causal autonomy.
They’re not pushed around by every immediate thing in the environment. They can think about
things that haven’t happened yet. And they can direct their actions toward things in the future,
sometimes, for us, decades in the future.”
No magic, no miracles—just a capacity for decision making passed down to us over the eons
from much simpler creatures, thanks to natural selection.

W

hat’s fascinating is Sapolsky and Mitchell have dived into essentially the same scientific
and philosophical literature about free will and yet surfaced with opposing conclusions.
Can one be declared more right than the other?

To my mind, Mitchell seems to be on the right track. We really do make decisions, and that ability
to make decisions has evolved over the eons. Simple creatures make simple decisions (“a
possible food source—must move in that direction!”) and complex creatures make complex
decisions (“I don’t like the candidate’s flat-tax proposal, but I like where he stands on offshore
wind energy”). A determinist might insist that whatever we do, we do because of what came
before. For simple creatures, that’s a fair position. A paramecium’s “decisions” happen more or
less on autopilot. But for complex creatures like us, our actions depend on conscious decisions;
for Mitchell, we are in the driver’s seat.

Mitchell’s view finds support in the work of physicist Jenann Ismael of Johns Hopkins University.
Physicists, of course, have long debated how the laws of nature work, and whether those laws,
right down to the behavior of elementary particles, do or do not allow for free will. In her 2016
book, How Physics Makes Us Free, Ismael lays out a position broadly aligned with Mitchell’s. Yes,
the past paves the way for the present, which in turn shapes the future—but humans are not
mere bystanders in this process. “It’s me that gets to decide, in the here and now, how the past
bears on the future,” she told me in an interview.
Ismael agrees that we are influenced by what has come before—but as she sees it, those
experiences inform rather than constrain our decisions. “From the noisy accidents of my life, I’ve
extracted hopes, dreams, priorities, and visions,” she said. “When I’m deciding what to do, I sort
through those things and make decisions about which of those get to bear on the future.”

Free will is the ultimate philosophical whack-a-mole.
And yet some of Sapolsky’s arguments are also convincing. He, too, has physicists on his side. In
her 2022 book Existential Physics, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder writes that the idea of free will
is incoherent. “For your will to be free, it shouldn’t be caused by anything else. But if it wasn’t
caused by anything—if it’s an ‘uncaused cause,’ as Friedrich Nietzsche put it—then it wasn’t
caused by you, regardless of just what you mean by you. As Nietzsche summed it up, it’s ‘the best
self-contradiction that has been conceived so far.’ I’m with Nietzsche.”
For Sapolsky, recognizing that individuals are shaped by their past offers a blueprint for a more
just society. Sapolsky believes we shouldn’t praise people for accomplishments they achieved
largely because of a string of advantages that helped them throughout their lives; and he argues
—correctly, I would say—that it’s wrong to condemn those who are struggling, merely because
of the many disadvantages they have faced.
Consider a neurosurgeon and a criminal. The neurosurgeon “is not a better human because
circumstances produced someone with the capacity to be a competent neurosurgeon,” Sapolsky
told me. “And the other person is not a worse human because circumstances produced
someone who is going to be violently impulsive in certain circumstances.”
At the same time, I can’t help wondering: If individuals don’t have the freedom to choose, how
can courts or legislatures or whole societies have it? If freedom is an illusion, it might seem that
https://nautil.us/yes-we-have-free-will-no-we-absolutely-do-not-431904/

7/12

24/03/2025, 10:58

an idea like “advocating for judicial reform” is rendered meaningless, too. How can one do

anything other than what we’re supposedly determined to do? In Sapolsky’s view, although we
can’t change the world, we can be changed by the world.
“Things change enormously!” Sapolsky said. “We don’t keep slaves anymore. We put on a
sweater today because it’s cooler than it was yesterday. Someone who used to be a white
supremacist now regrets it and works for tolerance. We get gummed up thinking we’re seeing
free will. We have this incorrect belief that we have chosen to change ourselves. The white
supremacist didn’t wake up one day and say, ‘Hey, it’s about time I stopped being a white
supremacist.’ He was changed by circumstances.”
So how did these two very clever scholars end up with such different views? I think the answer is
they targeted different facets of the free will puzzle. Sapolsky is worried we overestimate how
much freedom we have by failing to take into account the biological, sociological, and
environmental forces that have made us who we are. And he’s right: We should take those forces
into account.
But he may have pushed the argument to the extreme, imagining that these restrictions on free
will leave no room for any freedom at all. Sure, the fact that my dad loved playing folk songs on
the piano when I was growing up probably increased the odds that I’d enjoy “Hey Jude” as an
adult—but did my past really dictate, down to the second, when I might reach for that glass of
water?
Mitchell, meanwhile, is focused on “rescuing” free will from a seemingly deterministic universe.
This rescue operation (which gets bogged down in physics) is not necessary; philosophers have
long argued that we can have the sort of freedom that matters regardless of what our atoms
and molecules are doing. At the end of the day, one can’t pick a winner between Sapolsky and
Mitchell any more than we can pick a winner between the New York Mets and the New York
Rangers—they’re not playing the same game.
Even though Sapolsky and Mitchell cover a lot of ground, questions remain. One might wonder
how to quantify those biological and cultural forces that anchor Sapolsky’s thesis. How might
one prove that they allow for no freedom at all? And for Mitchell, who struggles to reconcile the
workings of complex creatures such as humans with the underlying physics: How, exactly, do
things like minds and agency arise from inanimate matter?

These two books show just how wide the problem of free will is. And because the problem can
be approached in so many ways, we can be sure it’s not going away anytime soon. As Ismael told
a lecture audience in Toronto recently, the puzzle of free will is the ultimate philosophical whacka-mole.
“When you tease out one thread of argument that’s supposed to lead to the conclusion that
there is no free will … people say ‘No, no, that’s not what I meant by free will,’ or, ‘the problem’s
not over there, it’s over here,” she told me. “And they give you a different argument, or they give
you a different conception of free will. So every time you nail down one of them, you get
something else coming up where people say, ‘no, no, the real argument is over here.’”

hould scholars serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony? Should you expose a fiction even if that fiction
sustains the social order? In writing my latest book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, I had to struggle with this dilemma
with regard to liberalism.

On the one hand, I believe that the liberal story is flawed, that it does not tell the truth about humanity, and that in order
to survive and flourish in the 21st century we need to go beyond it. On the other hand, at present the liberal story is still
fundamental to the functioning of the global order. What’s more, liberalism is now attacked by religious and nationalist fanatics
who believe in nostalgic fantasies that are far more dangerous and harmful.
